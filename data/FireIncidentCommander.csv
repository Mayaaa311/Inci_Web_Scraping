Slash Pile Burning 2021,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Fuels reduction programs involve mechanical or hand thinning projects, removing trees to reduce forest density and improve forest health. While larger logs are removed for use, unmarketable limbs, saplings, and brush are piled up for burning. Hand piles result from crews using chainsaws to thin the forest and then piling the sawn material; machine piles result from using logging equipment and primarily consist of tree limbs left behind after marketable material is removed.    Piles are only ignited when fuels managers are confident that the project can be undertaken safely and successfully. Snow cover, fuel moisture, precipitation, wind, temperature, and available firefighter staffing are all considered before beginning a pile burn. Piles which are ready for burning are prioritized based on elevation, aspect, access, and proximity to homes. Smoke, flames, and glowing embers are often visible, and are a normal part of pile burning operations. Snow helps contain the piles and firefighters monitor the area during and after the burn. Public and firefighter safety is always the number-one priority in burning operations.    Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health; for more information see http://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health/.    To get the latest updates on when and where burning will occur, follow us on Twitter and Facebook @usfsarp.

Elkhorn-Pingree Hill Prescribed Burns,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Since ignitions began last week on the Elkhorn portion of the Elkhorn-Pingree Hill Prescribed Burn in the Poudre Canyon, 450 acres have burned. Firefighters are staffing the burn today and the area received precipitation yesterday. No ignitions are planned today and there is minimal smoke visible. Firefighters will continue to monitor the burn and watch conditions for the next available burn window. This will be the last update unless conditions change until ignitions can resume. 
The Elkhorn - Pingree Hill Prescribed Burn is located in the Poudre Canyon. Firefighters burned portions of Pingree Hill in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018. No burning has taken place yet on Elkhorn. The Pingree Hill Prescribed Burn is located northeast of Rustic at the intersection of Highway 14 and Pingree Hill road, south of Kelly Flats Road and is 1,913 acres. The Elkhorn Prescribed Burn is located approximately two miles northwest of Rustic, south of Sevenmile Road, above the Arrowhead Visitor Center and is 2,191 acres.
Appropriate conditions must be met before ignition of prescribed burns can take place. Fire managers are carefully monitoring these conditions, including a favorable weather forecast (temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.), fuel moisture, smoke dispersal and staffing. Weather is monitored throughout the burn and burning will be halted if conditions fall outside of the required conditions.   In ideal conditions, as many as 500 acres could be burned in one day. The goal of the burn is to reduce hazardous fuels and improve wildlife habitat. Work has already taken place within this project area to help ensure the burn stays within its identified perimeter.   Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information see https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health.

Bighorn Sheep Prescribed Burn,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Firefighters successfully burned over 400 acres of the Bighorn Sheep Prescribed Burn. Burning of the remaining acres is expected to take place in early 2020 when conditions allow.
 
Fire managers on the Canyon Lakes Ranger District are monitoring conditions on the Roosevelt National Forest to conduct the Bighorn Sheep Prescribed Burn in the Poudre Canyon in an effort to improve wildlife habitat and reduce hazardous fuels. Burning could begin as soon as February 25 and continue as conditions allow.This prescribed burn is located on the north side of the Poudre Canyon near the Roaring Creek Trailhead, approximately eight miles west of Rustic. The project is 636 acres, with 85% of these acres on National Forest System lands and the other 15% on Colorado Parks and Wildlife lands. Burning expected to take place when south facing slopes within the project area generally have minimal to no snow and north facing slopes have snow cover to contain the burn. Appropriate conditions must be met before burning can take place, including favorable weather forecast (wind, precipitation, etc.), fuel moisture, smoke dispersal and staffing. Weather is monitored throughout the burn and burning will be halted if conditions fall outside of the required conditions. In ideal conditions, as many as 500 acres could be burned in one day. The burn will be staffed with approximately 10-15 firefighters and may include support from local agencies and volunteer fire departments. Public and firefighter safety is always the number one priority in burning operations.There may be smoke impacts or temporary delays in access on the Roaring Creek Trail while burning operations are taking place. There are many hiking opportunities in the Poudre Canyon. Check for alternatives at https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recarea/?recid=36603.

2021 Umatilla NF Prescribed Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Umatilla National Forest prescribed fire page contains information on the Forest's planned, active and completed prescribed burning for 2021. In general, there are two burn seasons each year to accomplish prescribed fire projects. Early season burns typically occur in late winter through the early fire season in late spring/early summer. Late season burns typically occur in late fire season and into December. The specific dates of a burn during a season is dependent on many variables including wildfire activity, resource availability, current and predicted weather, and smoke management constraints. 
Frequent, low-intensity fire is essential for healthy forests and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire caused by excessive fuel buildup. Prescribed burning is an effective tool for removing excessive amounts of brush, shrubs, and trees, while also encouraging the growth of native vegetation.

Kaibab NF South Zone Rx Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Fire managers on the Kaibab National Forest are well into the 2021 fall and 2022 spring prescribed fire burning season that began in October of this year. Prescribed fires will be occurring at multiple locations on the north zone and south zone of the Kabab National Forest. The Grand Canyon National Park will also be conducting prescribed burns over the next few months on both the north and south rims. 
Winter weather with snow on the ground present excellent opportunities every year for fire crews to burn and consume piled slash and woody debris left over from previous forest restoration projects.  For the month of January, approximately 1100 acres of piles south and southwest of the city of Williams are planned for burning with an additional 600 acres on the Tusayan Ranger District.

 This Thursday, Jan 20, 2020, the Dolores Ranger District Fire and Fuels staff plan to burn slash piles near Joe Moore Reservoir. The project is situated in Montezuma County, in the Millwood/Chicken Creek area of the district, north of Mancos off FSR 559. We plan to burn 300 piles, weather and conditions permitting. Smoke will be visible from Highway 184 and Highway 160, but should stay away from populated areas. Signs will be posted to notify the public of prescribed burning activity near the treatment area.  Ignitions of the piles will not start before 9am and continue past 3pm on Thursday, January 20th. There is no need to contact dispatch about smoke seen from this prescribed burn.
Reintroduction of fire is necessary to improve and restore vegetative conditions. This effort will reduce hazardous ground fuels, lessen the risk of unplanned large-scale wildfire, help restore ecosystems, and improve wildlife habitat. Prescribed fire also reduces the ladder fuels that can carry fire into the canopy, killing mature trees.

Cedar Central Prescribed Burn,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] KINGS CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Calif.  – Fire staff completed ignitions on the last segment of the Cedar Central Prescribed Burn unit on Monday, May 25, 2020, for a total of 245 acres treated since Sunday. With ignitions complete, firefighters will continue to patrol the area as vegetation inside the unit self-extinguishes.The Cedar Central Prescribed Burn is located east of Moraine Campground, north and south of Highway 180, west of Roads End, and on both sides of the Kings River.
When Cedar Grove opens to the public, visitors driving or hiking near the area may see smoke and/or areas of active flame. For safety, trail closures in the prescribed burn and on some trails leading to it will remain closed until conditions in the area have progressed to a stage where minimal public hazard remains, as determined by the Burn Boss or the parks’ Fire Management Officer. 
“We are grateful for the public’s understanding of the trail and area closures on this prescribed burn,” said Jeremy Loyd, burn boss trainee. “Hazards such as fire weakened trees, snags, and pockets of heat may not be readily apparent from a distance. We want everyone to return home safe.”  
Smoke impacts are expected to be limited to Cedar Grove, and will lessen as fuels within the prescribed burn area are consumed and ultimately go out. Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks work with the San Joaquin Air Pollution Control District to coordinate and regulate smoke contributions to the airshed.

Magic Feather Prescribed Burn,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]·Ignitions on the Magic Feather Prescribed Burn near Red Feather Lakes have been completed for today (12/3) with an additional 50 acres burned, bringing the two-day total to 90 acres. No ignitions are expected tomorrow, but firefighters will be patrolling and monitoring the area throughout the weekend and until snow is forecasted early next week. Smoke will remain visible in the area over the next few days and the Mount Margaret Trail system remains closed through the weekend. 
Firefighters on the Canyon Lakes Ranger District of the Roosevelt National Forest are closely monitoring local conditions, including favorable winds, to begin prescribed fire operations as soon as Dec. 2, 2021, on the Magic Feather Prescribed Burn to improve forest health.  Burning is planned on the interior of already established blacklines around the unit, providing a control feature, and staffing will be over the minimum levels identified in the burn plan. Timing of this is meant to take advantage of conditions that allows the burn to more closely mimic natural fire behavior in these types of fuels, allowing fire to carry throughout the burn unit to meet the burn objectives.  This burn is located east and southeast of Red Feather Lakes. Burning operations could include one unit totaling approximately 300 acres, located north of County Road 74E (Red Feather Lakes Road). Work has already taken place in the area to prepare for ignitions, including tree cutting around the perimeter and within the interior of the project.  Appropriate, localized conditions must be met before ignition of prescribed burns can take place. Fire managers have been carefully monitoring these conditions, including favorable weather forecast (temperature, wind, precipitation, relative humidity), fuel moisture, smoke dispersal and staffing. Weather is monitored throughout the burn and burning will be halted if conditions fall outside of the required conditions.  Residents and visitors in the area should expect to see smoke when operations are taking place. The Mount Margaret Trail system will be closed during operations. Please follow all signage. Smoke may also impact those using the Dowdy Lake Campgrounds and Day-Use Area.

Woodbury Fire - BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams have been established to begin burned area surveys of the wildfires that recently burned on federal lands of the U.S. Forest Service - Southwestern Region. BAER team surveys are rapid assessments of the burned areas that evaluate post-fire conditions of the burned watersheds and determine the potential for increased post-fire flooding, sediment flows, and rockslides.   BAER teams typically consist of scientists and specialists including hydrologists, geologists, soil scientists, road engineers, botanists, wildlife and fisheries biologists, archaeologists, recreation and trails specialists, and geographic information specialists, from federal and state agencies. BAER teams work together during the burned area surveys, field data analysis and modeling phase, to present findings along with recommended BAER treatments to the Forest Supervisor.   BAER teams analyze the data they collect during the surveys, to produce a “Soil Burn Severity” map. This is the first step in assessing potential watershed impacts from wildfires to any downstream values that may be at-risk from potential increased flooding, sedimentation, debris flows, and rockslides. BAER teams produce a report that includes a description of the assessment and findings for the burned area’s post-fire conditions along with recommended emergency stabilization measures and actions. BAER emergency stabilization efforts are focused on the protection of human life, safety and property, as well as critical cultural and natural resource values such as the water quality of lakes, rivers, and streams.   BAER reports are also shared with interagency cooperators who work with downstream private home and landowners to prepare for potential post-fire flooding and sediment flow impacts.   SPECIAL NOTE: Everyone near and downstream from the burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains over the burn scars. Flash flooding may occur quickly during heavy rain events.

Thursday crews were challenged by extreme fire conditions caused by low relative humidity and elevated winds. There were some spot fires were easily suppressed by the wildland crew. Smoke should travel to the northeast and is expected to dissipate prior to impacting Interstate 40. During the evening smoke is predicted to settle within Jacks Canyon. 
After careful review and discussion by fire managers, both Hart and Duke Fires will be allowed to burn in their predetermined fire perimeter to obtain resource objectives. Low intensity wildfires are used to help protect ponderosa pine forests from more severe damage by cleaning the forest floor of existing dried pine needles, dead shrubs and grasses. Too much accumulation of dried and dead fuels could allow fires to reach the canopy of the trees and possible crown fires. Fire also helps fertilize the soils to ensure a healthier forest.

Dixon Fire,"

Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest fire managers are making use of a lightning-caused fire to meet multiple resource objectives in the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness. The Dixon Fire is located east of Silver Peak on the north side of Dixon Creek and was discovered on July 28 by aerial reconnaissance after storms passed through the area. 
Fire is a natural occurring component of Sierra Nevada ecosystems, important for both plants and animals. The reason for managing a naturally-occurring wildfire is to allow fire to play its historical role on the landscape. A naturally ignited fire can decrease the threat of future high intensity, high-severity wildfires by reducing hazardous fuel accumulations; reduce the risk of insect and disease outbreak; recycle nutrients that increase soil productivity; and improve wildlife habitat by increasing forbs/forage.
The fifteen-acre Dixon Fire is burning deep in the Wilderness and being managed for the following multiple resource objectives: reducing accumulated forest fuels, reintroducing fire into the ecosystem, ensuring firefighter and public safety, and decreasing the risk of future catastrophic fires in the area. 
Fire personnel will continue to carefully monitor the Dixon fire from lookouts, aerial reconnaissance, and fire cameras. Visitors to the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness should expect to see smoke. The fire is currently posing no threat to recreationists, but please avoid the fire area for public safety.

IPNF Prescribed Fire 2019,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]·Please see the announcements tab for a summary of planned activity.Prescribed fire is an important component of the USDA Forest Service’s natural resource management program on the Idaho Panhandle National Forest (IPNF). It is intended to reduce hazardous fuels, create fire-adapted communities, reduce risk to firefighters responding to wildland fires, improve the ability to manage wildland fires, benefit wildlife habitat, recycle nutrients, and increase forest resiliency while trending toward desired species composition. Fire is the greatest change agent in our forest and grassland systems. These systems have evolved with fire and must have fire to remain resilient and productive. Prescribed fire can also be the most economical means to reduce community risk to wildland fire. Accumulated dead vegetation on the ground and ladder fuels (vegetation that facilitates the transition of fire from the forest floor to the canopy) will be reduced within prescribed burn areas, making future fire suppression efforts safer. Healthy forests provide a safer environment for wildland firefighters and residents when wildfires inevitably occur. Fire managers strive to minimize impacts from prescribed fire to local communities. However, smoke is an unavoidable byproduct of these crucial efforts. During the planning process, fire managers work closely with the Idaho/Montana Airshed Group, the National Weather Service, and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to preserve air quality. The agencies work cooperatively to prevent smoke impacts while using fire to accomplish land management objectives. In addition, appropriate conditions must be met prior to ignition, including a favorable weather forecast (temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.), fuel moisture, smoke dispersal and staffing. Plans for prescribed burns contain a set of parameters that define the desired weather and fuel conditions under which a prescribed fire may be ignited. These conditions are continuously monitored by fire personnel through the treatment process.

Newman Fire BAER Info,"

A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team has been established to begin burned area surveys of the Museum Fire. BAER team assessments are rapid evaluations of post-fire conditions of the burned landscape to determine the level of risk from potential flooding and debris flow to values on National Forest System (NFS) lands such as human life, safety, property, and critical natural and cultural resources. If unacceptable risks are found the team recommends appropriate and effective emergency stabilization measures to reduce the risks to National Forest lands and values. BAER teams conduct field surveys and use science-based models to rapidly evaluate and assess the burned area. 
The BAER program is designed to identify and manage potential risks to resources on NFS lands and reduce these threats through appropriate emergency measures to protect human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources. BAER is an emergency program for stabilization work that involves time-critical activities to be completed before the first damaging storm event to meet program objectives.
BAER teams typically consist of scientists and specialists including hydrologists, geologists, soil scientists, road engineers, botanists, wildlife and fisheries biologists, archaeologists, recreation and trails specialists, and geographic information specialists, from federal and state agencies. BAER teams work together during the burned area surveys, field data analysis and modeling phase, to present findings along with recommended BAER treatments to the Forest Supervisor. 
BAER teams analyze the data they collect during field surveys, to produce a “Soil Burn Severity” map. This is the first step in assessing potential watershed impacts from wildfires to values that may be at-risk from potential increased flooding, sedimentation, debris flows, and rockslides. BAER teams produce a report that includes a description of the assessment and findings for the burned area’s post-fire conditions along with recommended emergency stabilization measures and actions. BAER emergency stabilization efforts are focused on the protection of human life, safety and property, as well as critical cultural and natural resource values such as the water quality of lakes, rivers, and streams on NFS lands. 
BAER reports are also shared with interagency cooperators who work with downstream private home and landowners to prepare for potential post-fire flooding and sediment flow impacts. 
SPECIAL NOTE: Everyone near and downstream from the burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains over the burn scars. Flash flooding may occur quickly during heavy rain events.

Payette Fall Prescribed Fire 2019,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Please see the announcements tab for a summary of planned activity for the current week.Prescribed fire is an important component of natural resource management and part of the fire management program on the Payette National Forest. It is intended to create fire-adapted communities, reduce risk to firefighters responding to wildland fires, improve the ability to manage wildland fires, restore or enhance wildlife habitat, improve forest and grassland resiliency, increase seral tree species, improve water carrying capacity in our soils and recycle nutrients. Fire is the greatest change agent in our forest and grassland systems. These systems have evolved with fire and must have fire to remain resilient and productive. Fire can also be the most economical means in reducing community risk to wildland fire. Accumulated dead vegetation on the ground and ladder fuels (fuels occurring between ground fuels and tree crowns) will be reduced within prescribed burn areas, making future fire suppression efforts safer. Healthy forests provide a safer environment for wildland firefighters and residents when wildfires inevitably occur. 
 Fire managers strive to minimize impacts from prescribed fire to local communities. However, smoke is an unavoidable byproduct of these crucial efforts. During the planning process, fire managers work closely with the Idaho/Montana Airshed Group, the National Weather Service, and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to preserve air quality. The agencies work cooperatively to prevent smoke impacts while using fire to accomplish land management objectives. In addition, appropriate conditions must be met prior to ignition, including a favorable weather forecast (temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.), fuel moisture, smoke dispersal and staffing. Plans for prescribed burns contain a set of parameters that define the desired weather and fuel conditions under which a prescribed fire may be ignited. These conditions are continuously monitored by fire personnel through the treatment process. 
 Signs will be posted on roads and information boards near all prescribed burn areas prior to and when burning is in progress.

Coeur d’Alene, Idaho (August 23, 2019)– The Snow Peak Fire was first detected on August 15, is currently estimated at 110 acres, and was determined to be caused by lightning from a previous storm. Fire managers considered the ignition source, location, management area, fuels and forest stand type, and seasonal fire danger into the decision to manage this fire for resource benefits. This decision was based on management direction set forth in the Forest Plan, which allows wildfire to fulfill its ecological role in diversifying forest structure and wildlife habitat. The Snow Peak Fire is in a roadless, backcountry management area, where prescribed and naturally ignited fire is the primary management tool for increasing stand diversity and big game forage, while decreasing hazardous fuels and diseased stands. This fire will be monitored and managed in a manner that adapts to changing conditions. Management actions may be taken in the future to ensure public safety or protect values at risk. Up-to-date information will be available via InciWeb or the Idaho Panhandle National Forests Fire Information line: 208-557-8813.

The Bodine 1 Fire in Mitchell county was ignited from hunters in the area burning trash. Mitchell County, along with 161 other Texas counties, are currently under burn bans. The fire was approximately 28 miles SW of Colorado City, burning on a private landowners ranch. The fuel type is Mesquite-Juniper mosaic mixed w/ short grass w/ rolling topography. Due to lack of significant rainfall this summer, critically dry vegetation provided active fire behavior. This fire did not threaten any structures and firefighters continued to patrol the perimeter of the fire on Monday, 9/9. Colorado City VFD's responded first on scene, and dispatched Texas A&M Forest Service that responded with dozers and engine crews from Merkel Task Force. Additional resources included air attack, a heavy tanker, a helicopter, and a local motor grader. On Monday crews continued patrolling the scene and mopped up hot spots as necessary. Increased moisture and clouds favored cooler temperatures Monday. Relative humidity numbers rose which helped with fire suppression efforts. Winds are forecast to be gusty and erratic Monday and Tuesday with sustained winds nearing 20 mph.

As of March 20, 2020, the Pacific Southwest Region of the US Forest Service postponed all new prescribed fire ignitions in the region:""Potential smoke impacts to the public are considered in all prescribed fire and wildfire management. As always, we will work in coordination with local and state health organizations and make any necessary changes should the need arise. This decision to temporarily postpone ignitions will prevent any effects from smoke that might further worsen conditions for those who are at risk in our communities, while reducing exposure for employees who might not otherwise need to travel, and creating social distancing for resources working on the fire.""

Shasta-Trinity Prescribed Fires 2019-20,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]See the 'Announcements' and 'News' Tabs for the latest information on planned prescribed burns.As temperatures drop and the first precipitation of the season has arrived, the Shasta-Trinity National Forest is beginning its preparations for fall, winter and spring prescribed fire projects.“Prescribed fire is an important tool in our mission to reduce build-up of hazardous fuels, restore forest ecosystems and improve safety of communities within the wildland urban interface,” explained Assistant Forest Fire Management Officer Ernie Villa.Pre-planned prescribed fire projects may take place at specific locations across the forest from mid-September through June 2020. Actual project ignition will depend upon local weather and fuel conditions. Planned projects include burn piles and low intensity understory burns of vegetation on the forest floor. The main goals of these projects are to reduce the severity of future wildfires and provide added protection for communities in the wildland urban interface. In addition, the prescribed burns will promote a diverse and more resilient forest and improve habitat for wildlife.“With the cool and wet weather this week, our first prescribed fire projects are being planned north and east of McCloud,” explained Prescribed Fire & Fuels Specialist Heather McRae. “These projects are conducted in accordance with an approved burn plan to ensure the safety of people and property in the area. Burn plans describe the specific conditions under which burns will be conducted including the weather, number of personnel and opportunities to minimize smoke impacts.”Pre-ignition public notifications will be provided to local media outlets and will also be posted on http://inciweb.nwcg.gov the Forest’s Facebook www.facebook.com/ShastaTrinityNF and Twitter www.twitter.com/ShastaTrinityNF pages. Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed burns are being conducted and some may see or smell smoke. People should not be alarmed; the fires will be carefully monitored. Local fire and government authorities will be notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout burning operations. Specific project location information will be available online at www.fs.usda.gov/stnf.
Burning may also occur intermittently at Forest Service Fire Stations, Ranger Stations and Campgrounds.

Blue Creek Prescribed Burn,"

Following a successful test fire on the morning of Nov. 19, firefighters are continuing with ignitions. Expect to see smoke in the area over the following days.
Firefighters are closely monitoring conditions to begin ignitions as soon as next week following snow melt on the Blue Creek Prescribed Burn. Fire managers will treat up to 270 acres in Blue Creek near Empire.   
Public and firefighter safety will be the number one priority in deciding when to burn, and the project will be implemented in close coordination with the Clear Creek Fire Authority and Clear Creek County Sheriff’s Office.   
The Blue Creek project primarily aims to improve bighorn sheep habitat in the Georgetown herd’s migratory range by maintaining open areas that the sheep need for safety, communication and forage. In addition, the prescribed burn will reduce the buildup of flammable vegetation that spreads wildfire, removing ground cover and undergrowth while encouraging aspen regeneration. Prescribed fire will help make the watershed more resilient to wildfire in the future, helping protect the town’s water supplies.  
The Blue Creek Prescribed Burn is the result of a partnership between the U.S. Forest Service, Colorado Parks and Wildlife and Clear Creek County. This project will complement the adjacent Mad Creek project that also involved thinning and prescribed burning for wildlife habitat improvement.    Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information see https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health.

Cow Creek Fire,"

GMUG Lifts Cow Creek Closures Delta, Colorado, Oct. 28, 2019 — Effective Monday, October 28, the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests will lift all areas within the closure around the Cow Creek Fire.  Forest Service Roads: Owl Creek Pass Road (FSR 858) from the forest boundary up to Owl Creek Pass), Cow Creek Road (FSR 857) and West Fork Road (FSR 860) from Owl Creek Pass.
Forest Service Trails: Cow Creek Trail (FST 220), Stealey Mountain South Trail (FST 258), and Courthouse Trail (FST 218), Stealey Mountain North Trail (FST 219), Old Owl Creek Trail (FST 236), Wetterhorn Basin Trail (FST 226), Spalding Park Trail (FST 237), FST 219.1B, 236.1B, 236.1A, and 144. The public will be able to access Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests lands in and around the fire area, which had been closed to ensure public and firefighter safety during ongoing fire operations.  “The potential hazards are still something we urge the public to understand and to prepare accordingly,” said Ouray District Ranger Dana Gardunio. “We want them to be able to get back on the forest safely, but also remember that these areas will be impacted for some time and will have a greater risk than other areas. We want to thank the public for their compliance while the closure has been in effect, and we really appreciate the public’s patience and cooperation since the start of the fire on October 16.” Due to the lack of significant moisture over the fire area, isolated pockets of heat and smoke may still be found within the fire area. The public is advised to have heightened awareness about potential safety hazards and exercise increased caution regarding personal safety while in the area. Remember to look up, down and all around for unstable trees and unstable ground. Potential risks in any area recently burned by wildfire include the following: Burned out stump holes that could cause injury if stepped in; Unstable terrain with potential for rolling debris (boulders, logs, rocks, etc.); Fire weakened trees and snags that could fall or drop large limbs; Blowing dust and ash on roads and hillsides.

October 28, 2019 – Mary Joanna Gomez from Mississippi was found alive and in stable condition by National Park Service personnel on the afternoon of October 28th and has been in contact with her family and will be reunited with them shortly. She was found off trail about 3.5 miles over rocky and steep terrain from her vehicle.
A California Air National Guard aircraft C-130 first located an SOS spelled out with rocks on the ground and later identified a person nearby. Ground searchers responded and were able to find Mrs. Gomez cold, thirsty and hungry, but in otherwise good health. 
Mrs. Gomez was reported missing by her family after missing her work shift in the Bay Area on Friday, October 25th.  Her last contact with family had been the day prior while visiting Kings Canyon National Park, when she stated her intention to visit Sequoia. Her vehicle was located on the night of October 26th which helped narrow down the search zone.

Image options: [ Full Size ]  Hazardous Fuel Reduction Plans for the week of March 16-20, 2020
 Per John Lange, District Fuels Management Officer, Kern River Ranger District:  
 Preparation work has started on the Shirley Loop broadcast burn on Greenhorn Mountain, located just south of the Shirley Meadow Ski Area with plans to burn approximately 67 acres this week.  This prescribed burn has been divided into manageable pieces, from 30-100 acres.  (Plans call for 350 acres total within this area).  
 There are pile units remaining on Greenhorn (Ice house Road-24 acres) that could be put into place should conditions permit this week, as well.
 These prescribed burns are designed to protect the community of Alta Sierra from catastrophic wildfire by consuming the excess unburned fuels in the understory, raising the canopy base height to lessen the potential for a wildfire to transition to a crown fire, and providing more space for currently suppressed trees in the understory.  
 Units will be burned if conditions are met, including smoke dispersal, weather conditions, fuel, and access.
  Be advised smoke will be visible from most communities surrounding Isabella Lake.  Use caution when driving.

KERNVILLE, Calif., October 16, 2019 - Hazardous Fuels Reduction projects are scheduled this winter on three mountaintops within the Kern River Ranger District on the Sequoia National Forest. Prescribed fires will be conducted when weather and fuel moisture conditions are within defined parameters to safely accomplish the project objectives. 
Burning may also occur intermittently at Forest Service Administrative sites - Fire Stations, Ranger Stations.
Fire managers work closely with the Eastern Kern and San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control Districts to manage smoke production and reduce any impacts.  The fuels reduction projects may commence as early as next week.
The objectives of the fuel reduction projects are to make conifer forest and other associated wildlife habitat more resilient to wildfire through the reintroduction or managed fire into the ecosystem, reduce hazardous accumulations of vegetation and fuels, reduce overall fire danger to firefighters and the public, and to build resilience to future catastrophic wildfires. 
Impacts to the local communities and forest visitors include visible smoke from most communities surrounding Isabella Lake, as well as the California Hot Springs and Glennville areas. The Kern Plateau burning will be visible to those traveling across Sherman Pass Vista and into Kennedy Meadows. There may be temporary “as needed for public safety” closures on the Unal Trail located on Greenhorn Summit and various forest roads.
Prescribed burn efforts will continue throughout the winter as weather and available resources permit. Check https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/ when burning commences for current information.

Hoosier National Forest Prescribed Burns,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The U.S. Forest Service will soon conduct prescribed burns to maintain, restore or improve early successional habitat, maintain wetlands, restore unique barrens ecosystems, and regenerate oak and hickory. Prescribed burns also reduce fuel loads, thereby lowering the risk of catastrophic wildfire. 
U.S. Forest Service fire managers work closely with the National Weather Service to determine the best days to burn to achieve desired goals and to maximize safety. Many specific conditions must be met for a burn to occur, including fuel moisture, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity, among other factors. Decisions are generally made the day of the burn once parameters have been measured or forecasted. Therefore advance specific notification for a particular burn can be difficult. Forest staff notifies the public in the immediate area of the prescribed burn. The public is advised to check the forest’s social media accounts and website for announcements of burns at www.fs.usda.gov/Hoosier and www.facebook.com/HoosierNF/.  All designated burn areas will not be accessible to the public on the day of the burn and for some time after the burn until the area is considered safe. If there are any hazards identified within the burn area, the area may be inaccessible for several days for public safety. Burning may affect access to hunting areas. For your safety, please contact the Indiana Interagency Coordination Center dispatch (812-547-9262) if you plan to hunt or camp in or near prescribed burn areas. An unfortunate side effect of prescribed burning is smoke. Fire managers burn only under atmospheric conditions specified in a burn plan and work with the National Weather Service to choose days in which the impacts of smoke are minimized. Smoke plumes from a prescribed fire usually rise high into the air where the smoke dissipates. Forest neighbors who wish to be notified of a specific date of a burn, or those who wish to report medical conditions that could be affected by smoke, may contact the Indiana Interagency Coordination Center Dispatcher at 812-547-9262.

Spring Rx Fire in South Central Oregon,"

Prescribed fire season has arrived in South Central Oregon, and fire managers on the Fremont-Winema National Forest, Lakeview District Bureau of Land Management, and Sheldon-Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Complex will be applying prescribed fire to the landscape. Prescribed fire is used by fire managers to improve forest health and wildlife habitat, and to reduce hazardous fuels to minimize the threat of high-intensity, severe wildfires in our area. Applying prescribed fire is a part of our continued commitment to protecting communities and natural resources from wildfires. Warmer temperatures, reduced snowpack, adequate humidity, and favorable winds are improving the conditions needed for firefighters to start applying fire to planned units. Area residents and visitors may notice smoke or fire on public lands in various areas during the next few months. Each prescribed fire can appear different visually depending on the forest type, fuel load, prescribed fire objectives, and how long fire has been absent from the area. Areas, where prescribed fire operations are taking place, will be well signed and may have increased fire personnel, traffic, and smoke in the area. Please stay clear of these areas when possible for public and firefighter safety.  Prescribed fire occurs on days when the Oregon Department of Forestry Smoke Management Office indicates there are suitable weather conditions for smoke dispersal. Following that approval, if overall fuel and weather conditions are favorable, firefighters ignite a test fire before moving forward with the prescribed fire. If the test-fire indicates conditions are not suitable, the prescribed fire will be postponed until conditions improve. All burning operations are monitored and patrolled frequently by fire professionals, to ensure public safety.  All South Central Oregon Fire Management Partnership employees are committed to a safe and successful prescribed fire season for the public and employees within these designated areas.

Airstrip ,"

The Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Tucson Field Office and Gila District Fire Management Office will conduct a multiple day prescribed burn on the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area (LCNCA), pending appropriate weather and seasonal conditions, from late May through June 2020. The Airstrip Burn will cover approximately 758 acres of BLM land on the LCNCA and is located seven miles north of Sonoita.  Prescribed fires are intended to mimic natural fire frequency and intensity. They improve the health of the land by stimulating growth of desirable grasses, reducing invasive plants, and managing fuel loads so that natural fires are less destructive. The LCNCA contains over 47,000 acres of some of the most biologically rich and ecologically diverse biotic communities in the world. The BLM’s management of the LCNCA brings together private ranchers and federal, state, county, and local agencies together to conserve and enhance the ecosystems in the area while providing opportunities for collaborative conservation stewardship. The LCNCA area and roads listed below will be closed from 6 p.m. the day before each burn to 6 a.m. the day after each burn is completed.  Specific area closure: ·         Airstrip Group Site-Closed to use ·         Airstrip Day Use Area- Closed to use ·         Dispersed Camping- Closed from the junction with the LC-6901 road to the junction of the LC-6905 road. ·         Empire Gulch Day Use Site-Closed to use  Specific road closures: ·         LC-6901- Closed from the junction with the LC-6900 road to the junction of the LC-6905 road. ·         LC-6902- Closed from the junction with the LC-6901 road to the junction of the LC-6905 road. ·         LC-6903- The entire road will be closed during prescribed fire operations. Fire crews will monitor the burned area during and after all prescribed burns.

Smith was reported as burning in brush and ground litter with a few heavies on a north facing slope.  Fire Management’s initial attack strategy consisted of Helicopter 523 (H523) and a heavy heli-tanker out of Porterville utilizing water drops in containment efforts. H523’s crew and Crew 40 took suppression actions on this fire. All hose and flagging has been pulled.  Size: 2.0 acres   Status: Called OUT June 8, 2020

The Havilah Fire was reported to be north of Breckenridge, ¼ acre in size, burning at a slow rate of spread, with moderate precipitation, and heavy winds (grounding aircraft). The fire was a 25x25 spot burning in grass and brush, later contained by Crew 8 and Engine 45 (out of Havilah). Size: 0.1    Status:  Contained at 3:54 p.m. and OUT at 5:40 p.m.
      Tree, discovered June 5, at 6:08 p.m. by Air Attack 410.  Tree fire was a lightning struck tree (20x20), north of Cedar Creek Campground.  Fire Managers responded AA410, H523 and Crew 8. This fire was within the old Cedar Fire scar. 90% contained on June 8th.  Size: Single tree with a 20x20 spot.    Status: OUT  June 8, 2020
Fires showing up days, and weeks after a thunderstorm are referred to as “holdover” or “sleepers”, a term used by wildland firefighting personnel. Sleepers are trees struck by lightning, sparking a fire within the trunk which brews unnoticeable for long periods of time.  In time, oxygen (air) makes its way in to “fuel” the fire, eventually becoming large enough to put noticeable smoke in the air.  Or, the fire spreads to adjacent ground fuels when they dry out enough to burn.

Bighorn Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]On June 5, 2020 at 10:22PM a lightning strike started the Bighorn Fire in the Catalina Mountains northwest of Tucson, Arizona on the Coronado National Forest.    Dry, windy conditions pushed the fire closer to communities and forced evacuations.  Type 4 Incident Commander Corey Robinson assumed command of the Bighorn Fire on Monday, July 13, 2020 at 6 a.m. The fire is in steep and rugged terrain in the Pusch Ridge Wilderness and extends east to Redington Road. The fire remains approximately ½ mile north of Catalina Foothills, 3 miles south of Oracle and 3 miles east of Saddlebrooke. The vegetation in the area consists of tall grass, brush, dormant brush and hardwood slash.   
The Bighorn Fire is a 100% contained as of July 23, 2020. The fire burned 119,978 acres to include iconic areas near Tucson like Mt. Lemmon and upper Sabino Canyon watershed. While the fire is a 100% contained, residual heat within the containment line may be visible for some time. A closure order remains in effect for public safety as there are hazards in the burn scar and the Bighorn Fire increased the possibility of flooding downstream and of sediment and debris runoff.  Post-fire events can result in tragic losses even years after the fire occurred. It takes time for vegetation and habitats to recover from fire events like the Bighorn Fire. We all need to remain vigilant. Federal and local agencies are taking steps to reduce the risks to life and safety downstream from the burned area. However, we also encourage residents in the area to develop individual plans to protect themselves and their property, and to remain aware of flashflood warnings issues by Pima, Pinal and Cochise Counties.

The Bringham Fire, located 22 miles north of Morenci, AZ, is currently burning on the Clifton Ranger District of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests. The Bringham Fire was caused by a lightning strike on on June 6, 2020. Due to the increasing complexity of the fire, the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests ordered the Southwest Area Type 2 Incident Management Team 4 on June 11, 2020. Team 4 assumed command of the fire on June 13, 2020 at 6:00AM. The Bringham fire transitioned back on June 23, 2020 at 6:00AM from the Type 2 Southwest Incident Management Team 4 to the White Mountain Zone Type 3 Incident Management Team, led by Incident Commander Matt Bullmore. The Bringham fire has decreased in complexity and has moderated to the point that command of the fire will transition from the White Mountain Zone Type 3 Incident Management Team, led by Incident Commander Matt Bullmore, to a Type 4 Organization, led by Incident Commander Joe Names, on July 2, 2020.
A temporary closure order has been issued to assure the protection of public health and safety in the Bringham Fire area. You can view the entire closure order at https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/asnf/alerts-notices/?cid=stelprd3793918.

Isom Creek Fire (#187),"

The lightning-caused Isom Creek Fire was discovered on Friday, June 5, 2020, during a BLM Alaska Fire Service fire detection flight.  The fire increased in size in the days that followed due to warm, dry conditions, causing the fire to cross the Dalton Highway to the west and reach the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. While the fire reached the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the pipeline itself remained undamaged as it was designed to withstand wildfires.   
The Alaska Type 2 Incident Management Black Team, led by Incident Commander Ed Sanford, assumed command on June 11, 2020, to coordinate efforts to protect Native allotments along the Yukon River and minimize impacts to the Dalton Highway, Trans-Alaska Pipeline corridor and Alyeska Pump Station 6.  
During the Type 2 Team’s assignment, safety personnel piloted the use of the Wind River Bear Institute Karelian bear dogs and their handler as a means to mitigate bear intrusions into fire camps. This strategy proved to be a successful tactic for mitigating human-bear conflict and it was the first time that these professionally-trained dogs have been used on an Alaskan wildland fire incident.  
On June 22, 2020, command was transferred to a smaller Type 3 organization, led by Incident Commander Kay Kudo. This change was made after a period of cooler, wetter conditions moderated fire behavior. The current situation prohibits burnout operations until warm, dry weather returns. Until burnout is completed or a more direct line is developed and secured, the eastern edge of the fire will remain a threat for potential spread.  
The Dalton Highway remains open. Travelers are asked to stay alert as conditions on the fire could change as the weather becomes warm and dry. Drivers are asked to use caution by driving slowly with headlights on, especially in areas of low visibility. Watch for firefighting personnel and traffic along the road.  The Yukon River Camp at MP 56, north of the Yukon River Bridge, remains open to provide services for food, fuel and lodging.  
Pilots are advised to check NOTAMS and be aware of any Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR) in place over the fire by visiting https://tfr.faa.gov for additional information.

Sand Creek Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Sand Creek fire was started by lightning and first reported on June 15th, 2020. It is located 21 miles northwest of Pagosa Springs, in the Piedra Special Management Area. It is currently estimated at 107 acres in size and is burning within an area previously burned during the Little Sand Fire of 2012. Smokejumpers parachuted into the fire area on June 16th. After assessing the fire on the ground, the decision was made not to engage due to hazardous snags (standing dead/damaged trees), heavy fuel loads, and difficult terrain.  
The Sand Creek fire has received significant moisture and more is predicted. The fire is now at 60% containment and will not be called out until Fire managers are certain no heat remains. The fire area closure has been lifted as of July 27th and all roads and trails are open. Smoke from the Sand Creek fire will be visible during the duration of the incident. Smoke is expected to be visible from the Piedra Road and the community of Pagosa Springs. Wildfire smoke may affect your health.

For the second day in a row, someone has flown a drone over the fire incident which has shut down all aerial operations in the area. We ask the public to please not encroach into this area either by vehicle, foot or flying drone, all of these can interfere with our operations and have the potential to be a safety issue. If an injury occurred or the fire flared up, we would be unable to utilize air resources, greatly slowing our response. Thank you.

It's all about the ""E"" (BAER) = Emergency
THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY  There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:
Fire Suppression Repair Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)Long-Term Recovery and Restoration 
Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

KNF Lightning July 2020,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]August 5, 2020 - The Klamath National Forest received widespread lightning across the forest in July, sparking numerous wildfires. Because of aggressive fire suppression efforts by the Klamath National Forest and numerous cooperators, a total of 31 fires have been declared out. Three of the remaining fires are controlled and being patrolled. The Little Soda fire on the Oak Knoll Ranger District is 95% contained. This highly successful effort was achieved by the combined efforts of 22 firefighting crews, 32 engines, 6 dozers, 6 water tenders, multiple aircraft, overhead personnel and numerous dispatch centers from California and Oregon over a  two week period. 
Firefighters worked long hours in challenging terrain to achieve these results including initial attack resources that worked through the night to stop forward progression of the Little Soda Fire, the 96 Fire, as well as the Doolittle Fire which threatened evacuation of Happy Camp, CA. Two firefighters sustained minor heat related injuries during suppression efforts on the 35 lightning caused wildfires.
Additional lightning is predicted later this week and in response the Klamath National Forest will be using a combination of fire lookouts and fixed wing aircraft to search for wildfire starts.

Golden Fire Summary Firefighters remaining on the Golden Fire are preparing to demob and return to their home units.  On August 2, 2020 the fire was declared 100 percent contained at 91 acres.Hand crews and engines have completed worked on mop-up operations and removed many of hazard trees.  Fire activity lessened as crews were able to dig hand line around the fire; interior creeping with pockets of un-burned fuel flaring is expected up from time to time. Crews were successful at keeping the growth of the fire minimal as they continue with direct attack strategies where opportunities allow.    Fire officials are asking everyone to avoid National Forest System roads 399, 319, 380 and 379 on the Idaho City Ranger District in the vicinity of the Golden Fire. Officials are concerned with this year’s above average recreation use. Vehicles, particularly ATV/UTVs and motorcycles will be competing with fire traffic in this location. These road systems are very popular among recreationists because they are easily accessible and create a loop for riders to enjoy the forest.  However, due to the proximity of the fire and potential threat to public health and safety, road guards and Fire Prevention patrols will be present, deterring traffic away from the Golden Fire. There are no immediate threats to structures and there are currently no closures in effect. Weather conditions remain hot and dry with temperatures well above normal. Forest Fire Prevention patrols are routinely finding multiple abandoned campfires. PLEASE, put your campfire completely out and cool to the touch!  Visit: https://www.flickr.com/photos/boisenationalforest/albums/72157715299338383 for photos of the Golden Fire.   For more information and maps visit: https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6898/  Please note: We are transitioning to a new distribution system for Forest updates and announcements sooner than expected.

The Dam Fire remains at 220 acres with 95% percent containment. Firefighters continue to monitor and patrolled the areas of the fire that are inaccessible. Crews will continue with backhaul operations, the process of gathering equipment like hose, hose fittings, nozzles, and recycling. Equipment will be cleaned, repaired, and organized to be ready for the next incident.      Hot and dry conditions are forecasted to subside. Slightly cooler temperatures and higher relative humidity are expected today into Wednesday. More information can be found at the National Weather Service website.   Road Closures: State Route 39 is open north of Azusa in Angeles National Forest as of 8:30 a.m. Thursday 8/6. Temporary signs posted on barricades in general slide & burn areas warning motorists of falling debris.  Fire Restrictions: The fire danger to the Angeles National Forest has continued to increase, and on Saturday, August 1st, the Angeles National Forest changed its Forest Fire Danger Level from VERY HIGH to EXTREME. Corresponding with this change, the Angeles National Forest moved into full fire restrictions including prohibiting campfires in developed sites.You may read the Angeles Forest Order No. 05-01-20-05 which prohibits all campfires within the Angeles National Forest. The Angeles National Forest uses a 6 Level Fire Danger Rating System to determine fire restrictions which it adjusts throughout the year.    No fires of any type including cooking stoves, lanterns, and similar devices which use propane, white gas, or similar fuels are allowed at this time.     ABOUT THE ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST   The Angeles National Forest is located within one of the driest, most fire-prone areas in the United States – where human-caused wildland fires are becoming larger and more frequent - significantly damaging natural resources as well as the important human infrastructure on these invaluable public lands.   Not all areas and resources impacted by these fires will recover naturally, so forest managers and partners have launched a number of restoration efforts intended to produce ecosystems that are able to adapt and thrive over time. Learn more about these fire restoration projects by viewing a story map on the Angeles National Forest website.  The Angeles National Forest is a unique area nestled in the midst of an ever-changing and growing population in the Los Angeles area. The Forest is one of the few remaining open space areas in Southern California. The forest is an important part of the overall health and well-being of the area population. It provides open space, solitude from the everyday stress of modern living, a place to conduct research, a haven for wildlife, and offers a wide variety of recreation opportunities.  
The Angeles National Forest was established by Executive Order in December 1892. It covers about 700,000 acres and is the backyard playground to the huge metropolitan area of Los Angeles. The Angeles manages the watersheds within its boundaries to provide valuable water to southern California and to protect surrounding communities from catastrophic floods.

Apple Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]On November 16, 2020 San Bernardino National Forest officials announced that the Apple Fire, along with the El Dorado and Snow Fires have reached 100% containment. These fires were previously at 95% containment because uncontained perimeters were located in steep and inaccessible terrain. Containment has now been achieved as fire in uncontained areas has reached natural features void of vegetation.
Although full containment has been reached, the three fires remain in a status called uncontrolled. That means smoldering continues within the interior of the burn scar perimeters.
""We're pleased to see this improvement, but we remain cautious,"" said Deputy Fire Chief Scott Howes. ""We've experienced below normal precipitation and several heat waves over the last six months. Temperatures continue to be high, the vegetation is drying out again and there is no new precipitation in sight.""Fire restrictions on the forest will remain in effect until conditions improve. Campfires, dispersed camping, smoking and recreational target shooting are among a number of temporarily prohibited activities related to fire safety. All fire restrictions are listed on the San Bernardino National Forest webpage.
Forest roads and hiking trails within the San Gorgonio Wilderness Area remain closed. Please check the San Bernardino National Forest website for forest roads and trails information.Mudflow and flash flood risk
Recently burned areas are at a greater risk of mudflows and flash floods. Fires eliminate vegetation that can hold soil in place and charred ground may be unable to absorb water. Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) efforts are focused on the protection of human life, safety and property. Rapid burn assessments identify areas that have increased potential for floods and mudflows. For more information, please visit the Apple Post-Fire BAER InciWeb page.
Incident backgroundThe Apple Fire started in Cherry Valley, Calif., on July 31, 2020, due to a malfunctioning diesel vehicle. With dry vegetation and southwest winds, the wildfire quickly spread, eventually causing evacuations and reaching 33,424 acres. At the height of the fire, over 2,800 personnel responded and assisted on the incident. Much of the northern and eastern sections of the wildfire burned on very steep, rugged wilderness mountains that were not accessible to firefighters and vehicles.

Pine Gulch Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] The Pine Gulch Fire was started by a lightning strike on July 31, 2020, approximately 18 miles north of Grand Junction, Colorado. Initial Attack resources were unable to corral this remote wildfire as it spread rapidly through grass, sage, pinyon juniper and fir.    
 
 The combination of drought-stressed vegetation, unseasonably hot weather and steep terrain led to weeks of active burning. Smoke columns were often visible from Grand Junction and the surrounding area as the wildfire exhibited extreme fire behavior.  During the night of August 18, the fire grew quickly due to thunderstorm winds up to 40 mph for a three to four hour period.  As a result, the fire increased by more than 30,000 acres that night.  
 
 Firefighters worked to protect homes and outbuildings using a combination of bulldozers and handcrews to build firelines. Road systems were used as control lines where crews initiated firing operations to slow the fire spread.   
 
 As of August 27, 2020 the Pine Gulch Fire became the largest wildfire in Colorado State history, surpassing the Hayman Fire that burned near Colorado Springs in the summer of 2002.   
 
 The Southern Area Type 1 Incident Management Red Team took command of the fire on August 30 and is coordinating efforts to complete fire containment and begin suppression repair of areas damaged by actions taken to contain the fire, such as retardant drops and building firelines.

The fire has remained at 50 acres over the last few weeks and is mostly burning inside control lines among a large rocky area with sparse fuels. This fire is located about five miles east of Dodge Ridge Ski Resort, 1.5 miles southeast of Gianelli Trailhead, and 2 miles east of Crabtree Trailhead (as a bird flies), and about a half mile north of Bear Lake. The fire burned north beyond a short section of the Lake Valley (#19E21) trail. See Map link above. Safety is our highest priority, and helping prevent additional wildfires and the spread of COVID-19 among our fire fighters and within the communities we serve is an important part of our focus on safety this year. The STF Incident Management Team is utilizing a confine and contain suppression strategy on the Bell Fire for firefighter and public safety, while utilizing existing features (rocky areas, creeks, and local trails) as containment lines. Fire movement is dominated by slow, creeping fire spread in the forest litter and woody debris with flame lengths usually less than 1 foot. We are committed to minimizing negative impacts to wilderness quality and character, such as using Minimum Impact Suppression Tactics (MIST). This is our last Bell Fire update since the fire movement is so limited, and we will update again if fire activity increases significantly.
  Most of California remains under the threat of unprecedented and dangerous fire conditions with a combination of fire weather, dry vegetation, and firefighting resources that are stretched to the limit. Due to these conditions, the Stanislaus National Forest has modified our rules about day use and fire restrictions through Oct. 15th, with conditions being assessed daily. Bell Fire smoke is likely visible from some trails and roads and smoke from several large fires are affecting air quality statewide. For smoke updates please see: airnow.gov. Please check the Stanislaus National Forest webpage about day or overnight use areas, as well as increased Forest-wide fire restrictions: www.fs.usda.gov/stanislaus

Weather
A persistent upper level trough of low pressure over the west coast with a deep marine layer influence will keep unseasonably cool conditions across the area through Friday with a modest warming trend starting by the weekend as the trough weakens.  High temperatures through Friday will be as much as 5 to 10 degrees below normal across most inland areas, and at least several degrees below normal near the coast. Relative humidities away from the coast will also generally be on the uptick as much of the area will stay well above critical levels through Friday. The one exception will be a few far interior areas with humidities forecast to drop into the teens each afternoon. Some drying should occur by Saturday with slightly lower readings across more inland areas then continue into next week.Gusty onshore winds are expected each day across the Antelope Valley where gusts of 25 to 35 mph are likely. However, with the increase in humidity, only a few locations are expected to have elevated fire weather conditions. The overage of this elevated concern could expand some by the weekend due to the expected drying. 

Closures:
 SAFETY: Effective Saturday August 1, 2020, the Angeles National Forest changed its Forest Fire Danger Level from VERY HIGH to EXTREME.  Corresponding with this change, the Angeles National Forest moved into full fire restrictions including prohibiting campfires in developed sites.  You may read the  Angeles Forest Order No. 05-01-20-05 which prohibits all campfires within the Angeles National Forest.   The Angeles National Forest uses a 6 Level Fire Danger Rating System to determine fire restrictions which it adjusts throughout the year. Cooking stoves, lanterns, and similar devices which use propane, white gas or similar fuels are prohibited at this time.
ABOUT THE ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST
The Angeles National Forest is a unique area nestled in the midst of an ever-changing and growing population in the Los Angeles area. The Forest is one of the few remaining open space areas in Southern California. The forest is an important part of the overall health and well-being of the area population. It provides open space, solitude from the everyday stress of modern living, a place to conduct research, a haven for wildlife, and offers a wide variety of recreation opportunities.

Apple Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY   There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:  -       Fire Suppression Repair  -       Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)  -       Long-Term Recovery and Restoration  o   Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.  o   Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.  o   Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

Lake Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Current Situation: Containment of the Lake Fire has increased to 90% due to the good work of firefighters over the past 24 hours. It has been burning in 100 year-old fuels consisting of Big Cone Douglas Fir, Oak, and Gray Pine. The fire is holding northeast of Interstate 5 and south of Highway 138 in steep and rugged terrain. 
 Control lines have been completed all around the fire’s perimeter. Firefighters are now patrolling the fire line to ensure that all lines continue to hold and that there is no heat near the fire’s perimeter. Firefighters have been monitoring the fire area for pockets of isolated heat and smoke. When safe to do so, firefighters have gone into the interior of the fire area to fully extinguish those hot spots that may pose a threat of spotting and escaping over containment lines. Crews have been able to perform a significant amount of fire suppression repair around the fire; primarily focusing on blocking off public access to dozers lines, rehabilitating some of these lines and installing a large number of water bars to prevent against erosion. However, due to the elevated fire activity throughout California and the drawdown of resources, crews will not be able to fully complete fire suppression repair of the entire fire area at this time. The Angeles National Forest is prepared to aggressively complete full fire suppression repair of the area once resources become available. On Tuesday, September 1, 2020, California Interagency Incident Management Team 14 will transition command of the Lake Fire back to the Angeles National Forest. 
Forest Fire Closure/Restrictions: The Angeles National Forest has closed all National Forest System lands within the Lake Fire closure area by Order No. 05-01-20-6. On Saturday, August 1st, the Forest changed its Fire Danger Level from VERY HIGH to EXTREME. Angeles Forest Order No. 05-01-20-05 prohibits all campfires within the Angeles National Forest.

The fire was burning in steep, rugged terrain, approximately 25 miles east of Walden and 15 miles southwest of Red Feather Lakes near Cameron Pass.  The fire burned through an area of 208,913 acres on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in Larimer and Jackson Counties and Rocky Mountain National Park.  The cause of the wildfire remains under investigation. Large scale and long duration evacuations took place throughout the fire.  During the time the Cameron Peak Fire was burning, there was another fire (East Troublesome) burning simultaneously to the west of the Cameron Peak Fire, on the west side of the Continental Divide. On October 22, the East Troublesome Fire spotted over the Continental Divide, and created what became known as the “Thompson Zone” of the East Troublesome Fire. This zone was managed by the Cameron Peak Fire Incident Management Team until November 9, upon which time command returned to the East Troublesome Incident Management Team.  On the Cameron Peak Fire, extreme temperatures, low humidity, rough terrain and gusty winds reaching over 70 miles per hour were just some of the elements that contributed to extreme fire behavior and rapid rates of spread. A major contributing factor to the large fire growth was the tremendous amount of beetle kill trees and the drought-stricken Ponderosa Pine, Engelmann Spruce and mixed conifer stands available as fuel.  The heavy concentration of standing bark beetle-killed snags, along with steep, loose terrain made it difficult to get firefighters safely into the fire for direct attack; however, this fire was always managed as a full suppression fire. Firefighters worked to protect homes and outbuildings using a combination of heavy equipment and fire personnel to build fire lines. Road systems were used as control lines where crews initiated firing operations to slow the fire spread. Air support was utilized in fire suppression efforts throughout the incident, but at times was limited due to conditions.  After 62 days of burning, on October 14, the Cameron Peak Fire became the largest recorded wildfire in Colorado's history, surpassing the Pine Gulch Fire that burned near Grand Junction in 2020.  On October 18, the Cameron Peak Fire became the first in Colorado history to burn more than 200,000 acres. Prior to 2002, there was never a fire larger than 100,000 acres in Colorado.  The Larimer County Damage Assessment Teams (DAT) completed assessments of all known structure damage caused by the Cameron Peak Fire on November 6. The Larimer County Sheriff’s Office released the following:  A total of 469 structures were impacted by the fire as follows  • 461 structures destroyed (residential and outbuildings)  • 224 residential structures were destroyed and 4 sustained damage  • 220 outbuilding were destroyed and 4 sustained damage  • 17 business structures were impacted (Shambhala Mountain Center)  • 42 of the residential structures impacted were primary residences   Dates and locations of damage  • September 7 – Poudre Canyon south of Highway 14 near Archer’s Poudre River Resort and the Monument Gulch area  • September 25 and 26 – Poudre Canyon between the Fish Hatchery and Rustic, the Manhattan Road area, and the Boy Scout Ranch Road area  • October 14 – Upper and Lower Buckhorn areas, Crystal Mountain, Bobcat Ridge, Buckskin Heights, Redstone Canyon, Storm Mountain, The Retreat, and Pingree Park  Approximately 30,000 acres or 9 percent of Rocky Mountain National Park was impacted by the Cameron Peak Fire, and both the Grand Zone and Thompson Zone of the East Troublesome Fire.  Over the duration of the Cameron Peak Fire, there have been 10 Incident Management Teams before transferring the fire back to the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland. Teams include six Type 2, three Type 1, and one Type 3.  Once the Cameron Peak Fire reached 100% containment on December 2, a significant amount of suppression repair work remained. Due to weather conditions, some of the work was delayed until the following spring.  Resources have traveled from over 46 states and Puerto Rico to work on the Cameron Peak Fire  Timeline of Major Events:  The Cameron Peak Fire was reported on Thursday, August 13, at approximately 1:48 PM.  Between September 4 and September 7, the fire grew over 78,000 acres in a 3-day period.  On the evening of September 8, 8-14 inches of snow fell and temporarily halted the growth of the Cameron Peak Fire at 102,596 acres. Authorities were hopeful the snow would help firefighters focus on problem areas. The moisture lasted for two days before temperatures began to warm up and dry out, bringing an increase in fire activity.  The next period of record-breaking critical growth was from October 13 through October 18. 70+ mile per hour winds drove the fire over 68,000 acres eastward during these 6 days.   ·       On October 14, after 62 days of burning, the Cameron Peak Fire became the largest recorded wildfire in Colorado's history, surpassing the Pine Gulch Fire that burned 139,007 acres near Grand Junction in 2020.  The Cameron Peak Fire would measure at 164,140 acres by the end of the day.  ·       On October 18, the Cameron Peak Fire became the first in Colorado history to burn more than 200,000 acres.  On October 22, the East Troublesome Fire spotted into Rocky Mountain National Park, between the Continental Divide and Estes Park. Due to this threat, evacuations were put into place for Estes Park. This spot, which was called the Thompson Zone, was subsequently placed under the command of the Cameron Peak Fire Incident Management Team.  On October 24 and 25, a winter storm brought 8-18 inches of snow across the entire fire area. This season-slowing event helped firefighters increase containment.  On November 2, the Cameron Peak Fire grew to 208,913 acres.   On November 2, the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office lifted all mandatory and all voluntary evacuations for the Cameron Peak Fire and the East Troublesome Fire.  On November 4, the containment was raised to 92% and would remain there for 24 days.  On November 6, the Larimer County Damage Assessment Teams (DAT) completed assessments of all known structure damage caused by the Cameron Peak Fire.  On November 9, the Thompson Zone of the East Troublesome Fire was transitioned back to the East Troublesome Fire team.  On November 28 the containment increased slightly to 94%.  Containment continued to increase slowly over the next few days to 97% on the morning of December 2.  On the evening of December 2, the Cameron Peak Fire was declared 100% contained. This occurred 112 days after ignition on August 13.  On December 13, the Cameron Peak Fire was transferred back to the host unit, Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland to be managed by a local Type 4 team.  Team History:  ·       The Type 2 Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team assumed command of the fire on August 15.    ·       The NIMO Portland Type 1 Team and the Type 2 Rocky Mountain Incident Management Black Team assumed command on August 26.   ·       The Southwest Area Type 2 Incident Management Team 3 assumed command on September 12.   ·       The Northwest Area Type 2 Incident Management Team 6 assumed command on September 29.  ·       The Rocky Mountain Type 1 Incident Management Team assumed command on October 14.   ·       Pacific Northwest Type 1 Incident Management Team 2 assumed command on October 27.  ·       The Northwest Type 2 Incident Management Team 10 assumed command on November 9.   ·       The Southern Area Type 2 Incident Management Gold Team assumed command on November 22.  ·       A Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command on December 5.  ·       A local Type 4 Team for the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland assumed command on December 13.  Additional Facts  ·       Communities near the fire included Estes Park, Red Feather Lakes, Crystal Mountain, Storm Mountain/Lake, Rustic, Pingree Park, Buckhorn, Poudre Canyon, The Retreat, Glen Haven, Cedar Park, Colorado State University Mountain Campus, and other private housing, ranches, and camps  ·       232 miles of suppression repair work is in progress to return impacted areas to pre-fire conditions  o   108.6 miles of dozer line and hand line  o   123.4 miles of road  ·       317 additional areas used for staging, helicopter landing spots, safety zones, drop points, etc  ·       549 water pumps were utilized across the fire area

The Indian Creek Fire was reported at 12:30 p.m. MT Sunday, Aug. 16, along Hwy. 20 at Jonesboro, just outside Juntura, Ore. It is burning in priority sage-grouse habitat on private, state and Vale BLM-managed lands in sagebrush, juniper and grassland. The size of the fire is currently estimated to be approximately 48,128 acres. 
Pacific Northwest Type 2 Incident Management Team 13, under Incident Commander Brian Gales, assumed management of the Indian Creek fire at 6:00 am on August 18th. Firefighters from the Vale and Burns Districts of the Bureau of Land Management performed initial attack in tough environmental conditions. Their actions provided a solid footing for current and future fire suppression efforts.The cause of the Indian Creek Fire is under investigation. Anyone who was in the area of Hwy. 20 at Jonesboro near milepost 203 about 12:30 p.m. MT Sunday is encouraged to contact Vale BLM Fire at 541-473-6374 or the WeTip hotline at 1-800-472-7766.

By 6 p.m. the same day its growth was estimated at 50 acres with active fire behavior and spotting a quarter of a mile ahead of the fire front. The fire is in steep, rugged terrain on the upper third of a north-facing slope. Crews constructed containment line to reinforce the retardant drops where the file had potential to advance toward Benchmark road.  The other portions of the fire burned into scabby timber and rock and the fire lost momentum to move.   Since containment line cannot be built within the rock, and the snag component within the perimeter poses a serious risk to firefighters, the 30% containment status will remain indefinitely.  On 8/23, the fire was transferred back to a type-IV incident commander, and most of the resources assigned to the fire were demobilized on 8/23 & 8/24.  As of 9/3, a type-V incident commander is in charge of this fire. Rocky Mountain Ranger District personnel will continue to patrol and mop up until seasonal weather terminates this fire.

Isolated areas of heat remain within the interior portions of the fire, now producing very limited smoke. Today fire personnel will continue mop-up operations and begin their suppression repair activity where possible while strengthening containment. Incident command will transfer back to the local unit Type 3 organization at 6pm on August 22, 2020.  History of Mining on Mojave National Preserve Several individuals have made massive contributions in terms of both time and resources to the history of mining in the greater California Desert area, including the eastern Mojave. Without their efforts, this current study would have not been possible. The vast land base, rich geological resources, and more than a century and a half of mining activity have generated a history that is vast and detailed. Primary source documents are numerous, especially mining items in several historic-period southern California and Nevada newspapers. Compilation of those articles—along with photographs, mining-claim information, and other sources—has been a significant element in piecing together the history of mining in this remote and often misunderstood region. Larry Vredenburgh has been paramount in this effort. His research on mining in San Bernardino and Riverside counties for the five-county study entitled Desert Fever: An Overview of Mining in the California Desert Conservation Area is the most complete documentation of mining activity in the California Desert area. The report was written by Vredenburgh and co-authors Gary L. Shumway and Russell Hartill, and was produced for the Desert Planning Staff of the Bureau of Land Management in 1980 and later published by Living West Press as a limited edition under the same title. Learn More about Mojave National Preserve's Rich Mining History. 
Significant Situation Natural and historical resources potentially being impacted are the desert tortoise habitat, the largest natural occurring Joshua Tree forest, and two historical mines the Morning & Evening Star Mines. Crews are working on the ground, with one helicopter for air support. 
WEATHER Increasing relative humidity is expected over this next week with a slight chance of afternoon and evening thunderstorms. More weather information CLOSURES All evacuations and paved road closures have been lifted. However, fire personnel and equipment are still working in the area and use of dirt roads within the fire perimeter are restricted. Before visiting a park, please check Mojave National Preserve to determine its operating status. SAFETY: A temporary flight restriction is in place over the fire area. Wildfires are a No Drone Zone.

Beachie Creek Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Beachie Creek Fire was first detected on August 16, 2020 approximately 2 miles south of Jaw Bones flats in rugged terrain deep in the Opal Creek Wilderness. A Type 3 team was ordered to manage the fire on the day it was detected and implemented a full suppression strategy. A hotshot crew tried to hike to the fire within the first 24 hours. They were unable to safely access and engage the fire due to the remote location, steep terrain, thick vegetation and overhead hazards. Fire managers continued to work on gaining access, developing trails, identify lookout locations, exploring options for access and opening up old road systems. The fire was aggressively attacked with helicopters dropping water. A large closure of the Opal Creek area and recreation sites in the Little North Fork corridor was immediately signed and implemented. The fire remained roughly 20 acres for the first week. On August 23rd, the Willamette National Forest ordered a National Incident Management Organization (NIMO) Team to develop a long-term management strategy. This is a high-caliber team which has capacity to do strategic planning. The fire grew slowly but consistently and was roughly 200 acres by September 1st, fueled by hot and dry conditions.   
At the beginning of September, a Type 2 Incident Management Team (PNW Team 13) assumed command of the fire. The fire size was estimated to be about 500 acres on September 6th. On that day, the National Weather Service placed Northwest Oregon under a critical fire weather warning due to the confluence of high temperatures, low humidity and rare summer easterly winds that were predicted to hit upwards of 35 mph in the Portland area on Labor Day. The unique wind event on September 7th created an extreme environment in which the fire was able to accelerate. The winds were 50-75 miles per hour, and the fire growth rate was about 2.77 acres per second in areas of the Beachie Creek fire. This allowed the fire to reach over 130,000 acres in one night. Evacuation levels in the Santiam Canyon area went directly to level 3, which calls for immediate evacuation. Additionally, PNW Team 13 was managing the Beachie Creek Fire from their Incident Command Post established in the community of Gates. That evening, a new fire start began at the Incident Command Post forcing immediate evacuation of the Team and fire personnel. From the night of September 7th, these fires became collectively known as the Santiam Fire. Ultimately, the Santiam Fire name reverted back to Beachie Creek Fire in order to reduce confusion for the communities in the area. The Incident Command Post was re-established in Salem at Chemeketa Community College. At the end of the wind event, the Lionshead Fire also merged with the Beachie Creek Fire having burned through the Mount Jefferson Wilderness.
After the night of the wind event, the Beachie Creek Fire was managed under unified command by PNW Team 13 and the Oregon State Fire Marshal and the focus shifted to recovery and preservation of life and property. On September 17th, a Type 1 IMT (SW Team 2) assumed command of the fire. Growth on the fire slowed and the fire reached 190,000 acres. A second Type 1 team (PNW 3) took over command of the Beachie Creek Fire, along with the Riverside Fire to the north, on September 29th. Evacuation levels were lowered or removed as fire activity slowed. At the beginning of October, seasonal fall weather moved over the fire producing several inches of rain. During these weeks, a BAER (Burned Area Emergency Response) team assessed the burned landscape and habitats to try to evaluate damage. On October 8th, PNW Team 8, a Type 2 team took over management of the fire. Focus efforts on the ground shifted from suppression and mop-up to suppression repair. On October 14, the fire was downgraded and transitioned command to local Type 3 Southern Cascades team.  The acreage topped out at 193,573 acres. Closures remain in place to keep the public safe from hazards like falling trees and ash pits that can remain hot and smolder for months after the wildfire event.

 The South Warner Wilderness of the Modoc National Forest is located in the southeast section of the Warner Mountain Ranger District and is 18 miles long by 8 miles wide. The Wilderness has very steep slopes on the east side and moderate slopes on the west. A variety of vegetation adorns the area from high desert sagebrush and juniper to high alpine terrain.  
This wilderness offers picturesque vistas and the highest peaks in northeast California. All of Modoc County, much of Lassen County, and the Black Rock Desert in Northwestern Nevada are visible from higher areas. Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen can be seen in the eastern panorama.  BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT  The Bureau of Land Management’s Northern California District manages about 3.5 million acres of public lands, covering a diverse landscape, ranging from the arid and rugged Great Basin to the fog shrouded forests of the North Coast. The Redding-based district office oversees field offices in Alturas, Arcata, Redding and Susanville and a field station in Cedarville. The district contains two distinct regions. On the east, the Applegate and Eagle Lake field offices oversee vast expanses of public lands in a high desert landscape, including about a million and a half acres in far western Nevada. Small communities depend on public lands for economic benefits, primarily through livestock grazing, and tourism uses ranging from hunting to mountain biking.   These lands provide habitat for 14 wild horse herds and special status species, such as greater sage grouse.

The Gin Fire is the result of 2 separate fires in the area that merged.  
Fire activity is picking up mid morning as solar radiation heats fuels. Readily available fuels aligned with a westerly wind and east/west drainage north of Apache Peaks causing the fire to run up slope. Crews were able to burnout a section of FR 220 to extend containment lines on the south flank of the fire. They also continued clearing along FR 220 to the west with bulldozers and masticating equipment. The southeast flank of the fire saw little movement, crews in this area completed prep work on FR 224. Today they will monitor and hold existing fire line on FR 220 and 224 and look for ways to minimize impacts to US 60 on the east flank of the fire.

THERE ARE NO ROAD OR TRAIL CLOSURES.The Copeland fire started on August 19 , 2020 around 3:00 am near Shaw/Twin Lakes area and is located approximately 5 miles east of McCall. The known cause of this fire is lighting.  Infrared mapping on August 24, 2020 is showing the fire at 91 acres.  The fire is on state lands bordering the Payette National Forest, McCall Ranger District.
August 27, 2020 - The Copeland fire is 100% contained and 97 personnel are assigned to the fire.   Today at 0600 the fire transitioned to a local type 4 incident. Firefighters have completed full perimeter control and have moved into the mop-up stages of the interior area of the fire and will begin rehabilitation efforts. Predicted weather for the next two days include a weak shortwave that will facilitate thunderstorm development with isolated moisture. Any storms that do form will be capable of winds up to 50mph. Cooler temperatures, increased humidity's and smoke impacts from the California fires will continue to moderate fire activity and have contributed to the successful work towards containment of this fire. 
The Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) continues to urge the public to be aware of and avoid the Copeland Fire area. No structures are threatened, but it is a popular recreation area. Boulder Lake Road is currently closed due to the danger of the fire, firefighter traffic, and aircraft dropping water and retardant. Please do not access these areas from Potter Lane, Paddy Flat Road, or other endowment, public, or private accesses, as this creates a safety issue for both the public and our firefighters. 
Valley County Sheriff and Payette National Forest have issued a road closure on Boulder Lake Road, county road 50403. The Payette National Forest, Idaho Department of Lands, and Valley County  Sheriff have enacted a road closure to provide for firefighter and public safety. Be advised, there is no access to the popular trailheads near Boulder Reservoir due to this road closure. This closure should be anticipated through the duration of this fire. Public is advised to remain out of the area to allow firefighters to safely engage in firefighting efforts.     .

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Medio Fire started on August 17, 2020, close to the forest boundary with Nambe Pueblo and about 1.5 miles from the Village of Rio en Medio between two streams, the Rio Nambe and the Rio en Medio. Fuels are primarily dry mixed conifer tapering to ponderosa pine at lower elevations. Heavy fuels in steep, rugged terrain add complexity to efforts to control the Medio Fire. Contrary to a traditional monsoon season, fuel moistures are very low for this time of year, and other fire indices are unseasonably high. Fire behavior has ranged from moderate to extreme, driven by terrain and winds. Due to the remote location of the fire and the rugged terrain, the strategy will be a combination of direct and indirect perimeter control and point protection. The Southwest Area Type 2 Incident Management Team 4, led by Incident Commander Carl Schwope, assumed command of the Medio Fire on Friday, August 21 at 6:00 AM.

The Castle Fire burned on portions of the Sequoia National Forest and Giant Sequoia National Monument (131,087acres), Inyo National Forest (12,508 acres), Sequoia National Park (18,984 acres), lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (736 acres), State (4,017 acres), County, and private lands (4,004 acres) and threatened the Tule River Indian Reservation. The Shotgun Fire burned 841 acres in the Golden Trout Wilderness, Sequoia National Forest.Containment of the SQF Complex reached 100% for the portion of the fire managed by the Sequoia National Forest. Smoldering debris around tree trunks continued to weaken fire-damaged trees, posing a hazard of them falling at any time.  Smoldering stump holes and their roots were found burning months after a wildfire, posing a hazard for anyone stepping near or on them. Much work is left to be done on fire suppression repair; heavy equipment is anticipated to return in the spring to continue this effort.  Forest officials have extended the closure of Sequoia National Forest managed land affected by the Castle Fire through December 31, 2021. Details of the Forest Closure and a map of the closed area can be found in the highlighted section above. The fire area is being evaluated for what portions can be reopened to the public. Hazards exist that may keep many roads and trails closed for public safety.
 An Interagency Emergency Task Force continues to prepare for flash floods and debris flow, busily cleaning debris from culverts and drains to minimize impacts. Those traveling thru the fire area on Highway 190 should expect frequent delays at roadblocks where work is ongoing.  Information and resources available to residents affected by the SQF Complex Fire can be found on Tulare Counties website https://tularecounty.ca.gov/recovers/

August Complex North Zone,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]This page is no longer being updated. For current information please visit the August Complex page. https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6983/

USDA Forest Service and CAL FIRE are engaged in a coordinated response to manage and suppress the August Complex.  The Complex has been divided into three zones; North, South and West.  Geographically, the North Zone is in the northern area of the Mendocino National Forest in the Yolla Bolly Wilderness; near Tomhead Lookout on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest; and in the northwest near Kettenpom Valley and the Flying AA Ranch on the Six Rivers National Forest. Current Situation (August Complex-North Zone): Conditions today will be dry, windy and with less smoke which will influence fire behavior. The priority in the North Zone is structure protection, indirect line construction (away from the fire’s edge) and tactical firing operations (applying fire on the ground to remove vegetation and widen containment lines). In Ruth Valley, south of Ruth (Six Rivers National Forest), the fire has become established above the Ruth Community Church and northeast of Horse Ridge Lookout.  As the fire continues to move northeast, firefighters will engage and do structure defense around the homes along the Ruth Lake Road.  On the west perimeter of the fire (Zenia Area), dozers are being used to construct indirect lines on Road 3S09 to Zenia Lake Mtn Road (3S21).   Crews are working to complete hand lines to the Middle Fork of the Eel River.   On the northeast perimeter (Shasta-Trinity National Forest), the 35 Road continues to be an important strategic containment line to stop the progress of the fire. Crews continue working from Rat Trap to the east, improving the line and using tactical firing operations. The east perimeter near Red Bluff is in mop-up and patrol status.  A ten-person crew of smokejumpers will be utilized on the north portion of the fire to assess historic structures in the area. Weather:   A trough of low pressure will bring gusty south-southwest winds over the area.  The winds combined with the low relative humidity will create elevated fire weather conditions. Smoke Outlook: Air quality remains unhealthy in many areas, with very unhealthy air overnight in foothill areas strongly affected by settling of down drainage smoke. Slightly stronger southerly winds may bring some gradual improvements today, with southwesterly winds continuing the slow clearing trend tomorrow.

Moraine Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] 
The Moraine Fire was discovered on August 21 after substantial lightning occurred over the area. It is located within the Sequoia - Kings Canyon Wilderness, southeast of Cedar Grove, Kings Canyon National Park. There is no threat to life or property at this time. 
Due to limited firefighting resources and the fire burning in designated wilderness, the fire is being monitored via air. However, fire managers are prepared to send firefighters in if the activity warrants and direct suppression action.  Fire managers continue to use a confine and contain strategy with natural and human-made features to respond to the Moraine Fire. Following the winter storm from November 7 & 8, fire managers continue to conduct helicopter observation missions over the Moraine Fire. Like many of the fires in the Sierra Nevada following this storm, much of the energy was taken out of the fire. However, there was noticeable snow melt by mid-week. A few isolated pockets of heat remain but there are no concerns with any additional major fire spread at this time.  However, Fire managers will continue to monitor fire activity near the trail with the possibility of closing Avalanche Pass Trail at certain locations due to fire activity. If a closure goes into effect, that information will be shared on the Closures tab of the page.    
Wilderness travel is still allowed in this area with a valid wilderness permit.  However, please use caution and follow all posted trail signs.  
The park is working with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. Smoke will be visible near and from high-country vistas. Smoke from regional wildfires in the State of California may also affect visibility over the area.

Hidden Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] YESTERDAY: There was no growth on the fire yesterday. Helicopter bucket drops kept areas of heat in check. Crews continued to work on securing, patrolling and mopping up containment lines. Warmer weather and lower humidity caused increased fire activity within the perimeter as expected. The increase in heat ignited unburned interior pockets of fuel in burnout areas, helping to secure containment within the existing footprint.
TODAY’S ACTIVITY: Warmer weather today will continue to support burning operations, as interior pockets of brushy fuel ignite and burn out, lessening the potential for fire growth beyond containment lines. Firefighters will continue their focus on securing and mopping up fire lines. Masticators will be used for suppression repair work in areas where contingency and protection work was completed.
AIR SUPPORT: Due to the increased fire activity throughout the Southwest and California air support is limited. We are utilizing shared resources of air tankers and helicopters with our neighboring Type 1 Incident Management Team.

Narrative: 
The fire area contains complex topography with intermixed fuels complexes.
 
Drainage bottoms generally contain ponderosa pine stringers (TL3/TU1) with consistent needle cast and short grasses forming a continuous fuel bed.
 
Pine stringers are often bordered by open pinyon/juniper stands (SH7) which contain sparse grasses.
 
Basins and consistent slopes contain a mix of manzanita and Emory oak (GS2) and lower elevation grasslands with short grasses (GR2).

Continued natural burning out of available fuels within the previous burnout operation areas until 1700-1800.
 
24 hours:
Fuels continue to be receptive to continued burning out if located near an ignition source. Due to continued and intensifying hot/dry conditions, smoldering pockets of brush and pinyon/juniper dominant areas within the fire perimeter will actively burn from late morning through mid-afternoon. 
48 hours: 
Unburned fuels will continue to sustain active combustion starting around 1000. High temperatures are expected to be lower as a strong cold front moves through the fire area in the mid-afternoon, but winds will be strong, gust, and shifting. Wind will likely ignite smoldering fires throughout the interior of the fire area, but fire is unlikely to negatively impact control features. After the frontal passage, humidity will rise and temperatures will fall. Fire behavior will likely decrease as well after winds begin to subside in the late afternoon.
 
72 hours: 
Slow start to the day as conditions are not as favorable for continued large-scale natural burning out of interior islands of unburned fuels. Active fire movement will likely require several drying/warming days to resume activity.

No smoke was observed during aerial surveys on the Alder Fire yesterday. Chipping will continue on the 1300 Road today.  
No fire activity was observed on the Rockhouse Fire yesterday afternoon. Crews will continue to monitor and patrol the fire perimeter.  
Excessive heat and drying is expected through the weekend.  
The Southwest Area Type 1 Incident Management Team #1 will transition command of the Rockhouse and Alder Fires to a Type 3 Incident Commander effective 7 a.m. on Saturday, September 4.  Firefighters will continue to focus on fire suppression repair.  
Some smoke may be visible from time to time within the perimeter of the fires until the area receives significant precipitation. Heavy fuels, like downed logs, can hold heat for a long time. Fire activity may occur within pockets of unburned vegetation within the fire’s perimeter, especially on hot, dry, windy days and in steep, rugged terrain. 
Firefighters will continue to protect values at risk as needed where they can do so safely and effectively. Challenges include extreme temperatures and steep and remote terrain. Firefighter and public safety are the highest priority. Firefighters are working to protect local communities; power lines; mines; range improvements; historical, cultural, and ceremonial sites; and natural resources.  
Highway 60 is open. There is a reduced speed limit of 55 mph along Highway 60 due to firefighters working in the area. Please use caution when travelling, observe posted speed limits, and drive with lights on for safety.

Slink Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Slink Fire was reported on August 29th at 6 p.m. in the Slinkard Valley southwest of Topaz Lake as a result of lightning in the area.
Situation Update: The Slink Fire is 90% contained. Because of steep and rugged terrain and the priority on firefighter safety, the last 10% of the fire located in the Carson Iceberg Wilderness will not have fireline constructed around it and will continue to smolder until it receives precipitation.  
Members of the public should expect to continue to see smoke, as interior pockets of unburned fuel continue to burn. These areas are well within the fire perimeter and pose no threat to containment lines. Firefighters from both the Carson and Bridgeport Ranger Districts will continue to patrol and monitor the fire, but will not no longer be staffing it.   
October 22nd, 2020: The Slink Fire closure has been reduced by 126,805 acres and is now confined to the fire’s footprint, meaning that areas that are burned or within the perimeter of the fire remain closed. Mill Canyon Road is now open. Please refer to the map at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/map/7105/0/110494 and avoid the fire area.

Ranch2 Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY   
 
There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:   
 Fire Suppression Repair     Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)     Long-Term Recovery and Restoration    
 Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.     Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.     Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

Rattlesnake Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Rattlesnake Fire was discovered on August 16 after substantial lightning occurred over the area. It started within the Sequoia and Kings Canyon Wilderness in the Kern River drainage and is now only actively burning just into the Inyo National Forest, east of the Kern River Ranger Station. The fire is burning in steep inaccessible terrain with sparse ground fuels and pockets of dead and down trees. While the size of the fire has increased, there are no current threats to life or property.In coordination, Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks and Inyo National Forest, are using a confine and contain full-suppression strategy utilizing natural rock features, existing trails, and other natural barriers as containment lines. Not only does this limit exposure to firefighters and minimizes impacts in the wilderness, it allows firefighting resources to be available to battle other wildfires across the area and state that have a greater threat to life and property.
Following the first major snowstorm of this autumn November 7 -8, fire managers continue to conduct helicopter recon missions over the fire. There was noticeable snow melt off by mid-week following the storm system and at this time, there appears to be no snow remaining.
The fire continues to back toward the Golden Trout Creek on the Inyo National Forest from the top of the ridge that separates the national forest from Sequoia National Park. Fire crews from Inyo National Forest and San Bernardino National Forest flew into the Little Whitney Cabin area on November 21 to install structure protection wrap for the cabins and buildings in the area. While fire is not threating these assets at this time, fire managers want to be prepared, as the meadow and surrounding fuels are extremely dry for this time of year. 
On December 2, fire managers conducted a helicopter flight over the area with the objective of mapping and observing fire behavior. Based on the minimal activity observed and concurrence by the unified commanders, crews will not be inserted for now. Another overflight was done on December 5. The Rattlesnake Fire is still active above the Golden Trout Creek but is surrounded by an old burn area. There is no visible flame or smoke along the actual Golden Trout Creek at this time.   As fire activity has greatly reduced, a fire crew was sent to the Little Whitney Cabins on December 9 to remove the structure wrap from associated structures. Precipitation in the form of snow and rain is expected over the area during the middle of the December.   National Park Service (NPS) Closures:   Due to the Rattlesnake Fire and SQF Complex, the NPS has a closure for lands within Sequoia National Park in the Kern River drainage within the following boundary.

Medio Fire BAER Team,"

 It's all about the ""E"" (BAER) = Emergency
THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY
There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:
Fire Suppression Repair Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)Long-Term Recovery and Restoration 
Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

Bridger Foothills Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Bridger Foothills Fire was detected around 3:00 pm on Friday, September 4, 2020. The lightning caused fire was the result of a storm several days prior, in late August. The fire is located approximately 2.5 miles northeast of Bozeman, Montana. Initial attack forces from local fire departments, US Forest Service and cooperators responded immediately, but were unsuccessful in halting the fire given the extreme dry conditions. By Friday night the fire had grown to approximately 400 acres.   Local resources attempted extended attack that Saturday, but a frontal passage with strong winds pushed the fire to an estimated 7000 acres. During this major push by the fire, the Gallatin County Sheriff initiated evacuations in the Bridger Canyon area, along with road closures. The Custer Gallatin National Forest implemented an area closure within and to the north of the fire. Exceeding the capacity of local resources to contain the fire, authorities ordered a National Type 1 Incident Management Team. The Rocky Mountain Area Type 1 team was ordered and assumed command of the fire on Monday morning, September 7.  On Sunday, September 20 the Northern Rockies Type 2, Incident Management Team 5 transferred command of the fire back to a local Type 3 team. Resources are being released as appropriate to right-size the incident.On Friday, Oct 2, the fire transitioned to Type 4 status with Paul Monforton as Incident Commander.After multiple days of warm, dry temperatures and red flag warnings, the fire did not increase in size or show significant fire activity.  Crews continued to patrol, grid, mop-up and perform rehab on suppression lines.  On Sunday October 11, a cold front moved over the area and dropped welcome moisture on the fire.  This precipitation, combined with the lack of fire perimeter growth, continued work of crews to increase containment and general overall seasonal conditions brought the fire to 100% containment on Monday, October 12.At this point, the Type 4 Team handed over all remaining patrol and monitoring to the local Bozeman Ranger District, with support from the Bridger Canyon Fire Department.The fire area closure has been lifted and all areas and trails in the Bridger Range are now open to the public.

Image options: [ Full Size ]Porphyry Fire UpdateSeptember 28, 2020  All fire area closures have been lifted on the Porphyry Fire.Trail and road closures have all been lifted and access is open to hunter and recreators. Please be cautious in and around the fire area as fire weekend trees and hot spots are still present. Smoke may still be visible at times but there is no need to report it as the fire will continue to be monitored by air and ground resources, until a season ending rain event occurs. Structure protection will take place as needed and crews are clearing out the Mosquito Ridge Trail and Hand Creek Trail.
 
The Porphyry Fire is still estimated at 14,486 acres, due to more accurate mapping, as fire progression was slowed thanks to rain and lower temperatures. No season ending event is forecasted for the Payette National Forest area. A season ending event is when wide spread precipitation of a quarter inch is received for three consecutive day.  Temperatures will begin to climb back up through the week and that will allow fuels to dry back out. Fire spread and activity may increase as the fire area dries out but overall fire activity will be low due to time of season, cooler temperatures and length of daylight. Although rain is expected over most of the Payette National Forest, fire season is still present, and all precautions should still be followed.   
The Porphyry Fire will continue to be monitored by air and ground as needed. Crews continue structure protection on 4 bridges and one structure along with mitigating some hazard trees around the Big Creek and Edwardsburg area.

El Dorado Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]On November 16, 2020 San Bernardino National Forest officials announced that the El Dorado Fire, along with the Apple and Snow Fires have reached 100% containment. These fires were previously at 95% containment because uncontained perimeters were located in steep and inaccessible terrain. Containment has now been achieved as fire in uncontained areas has reached natural features void of vegetation.Although full containment has been reached, the three fires remain in a status called uncontrolled. That means smoldering continues within the interior of the burn scar perimeters. As an illustration of that, smoke continued to be seen from the El Dorado Fire in the Forest Falls, Calif., community during the second week of November after a winter storm brought several inches of snow.Evacuation warnings were lifted on Wednesday, November 11 at 8:50 AM by the San Bernardino County Sheriff for the communities of Mountain Home Village, Forest Falls, Angelus Oaks, Seven Oaks, and Barton Flats. These communities are open to residents only until further notice. 
 ""We're pleased to see this improvement, but we remain cautious,"" said Deputy Fire Chief Scott Howes. ""We've experienced below normal precipitation and several heat waves over the last six months. Temperatures continue to be high, the vegetation is drying out again and there is no new precipitation in sight.""Fire restrictions on the forest will remain in effect until conditions improve. Campfires, dispersed camping, smoking and recreational target shooting are among a number of temporarily prohibited activities related to fire safety. All fire restrictions are listed on the San Bernardino National Forest webpage.
Forest roads and hiking trails within the San Gorgonio Wilderness Area remain closed. Please check the San Bernardino National Forest websitefor forest roads and trails information.Please be advised that there will be delays in traffic on State Route highway 38 due to road work and erosion control by Cal Trans in the area. Please drive with care and at slower speeds to help ensure firefighter safety. Please check https://roads.dot.ca.gov/ for updated highway conditions.Post-fire emergency preparedness for local residents:Residents and visitors in the fire area should be aware that recently burned areas are at a greater risk of mudflows and flash floods. Fires eliminate vegetation that hold soil and rocks in place and charred ground may be unable to absorb water. Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) Teams and CAL FIRE Watershed Emergency Response Team (WERT) efforts are focused on the protection of human life, safety, and property. Rapid burn assessments identify areas that have increased potential for floods and mudflow, enabling county, state, and federal emergency managers to better plan their responses to future rain events. For more information, please visit the El Dorado Post-Fire BAER InciWeb page.    
 Residents in the mountain and foothill areas should stay informed of weather forecasts. Register your cell phones with the Telephone Emergency Notification System (TENS) / Swift 911 and have an emergency plan.  Visit www.sbcounty.gov for more emergency preparedness information.     El Dorado Fire narrative:  
 The El Dorado Fire began on September 5th in El Dorado Park near Yucaipa, CA. Temperatures recorded the day the fire started were 15 to 20 degrees above normal, and in many cases broke new record high temperatures.  Over a 23-day period, the fire burned 22,680 acres in the Oak Glen / Yucaipa Ridge area and within the San Gorgonio Wilderness Area of the San Bernardino National Forest. The fire forced the evacuations of Oak Glen, north Yucaipa, Mountain Home Village, Forest Falls, and Angelus Oaks communities. The fire required 60 miles of fireline and ranged from a minimum elevation of 3030’ to a maximum of 10,640’. There were 4 residences damaged, 5 residences destroyed along with 15 other structures destroyed.   
 The incident command post was established at Yucaipa Regional Park, Yucaipa, CA, and two interagency incident management teams rotated through the incident: California Interagency Management Team 11 (Incident Commander Chris Fogle), and California Interagency Management Team 13 (Incident Commander Mike Wakoski).     
 At the peak, there were 1,351 personnel assigned to the fire including 17 hand crews, 177 engines, 20 water tenders, 17 dozers, and 10 helicopters.  Numerous Fixed Wing Tankers including a DC-10 assisted with aerial fire-retardant drops. Three Canadian Fire Bosses and a Single Engine Air Tanker (SEAT) Water Scooper were also used for the first time in Southern California and were based out of Big Bear Airport & Lake.   
 This fire resulted in one firefighter fatality, Charlie Morton, a 14-year veteran firefighter with the San Bernardino National Forest, as well as thirteen injuries. The memorial service for fallen USDA Forest Service firefighter Charles Edward Morton was held on Friday, September 25, 2020, at 11 a.m. in San Bernardino, CA.   
 Nearly 3,000 phone calls were placed by affected residents to the San Bernardino National Forest’s Fire Information Center, (909-383-5688), and nearly one million pageviews on https://Inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7148/ Two community meeting were held in Forest Falls and in Angelus Oak as the respective communities were repopulated. Two additional Facebook Live events were held to answer questions regarding the fire.

Very strong northerly winds created wind-driven fire behavior into the evening. Since then, winds have been relatively calm and fire behavior can be described as mostly creeping and smoldering with occasional torching of trees. Rock outcrops and other natural barriers have helped stop the fire's spread, particularly on the eastern edge.  No evacuations have been necessary and no structures have been destroyed, although the small community of Lakeview was threatened. Fire control efforts have included structure protection and a shaded fuel break constructed between Lakeview and the fire.  Roads and trails in the fire vicinity have been closed to protect firefighter and public safety.

Fire activity has been minimal, however windblown needle cast over the completed fire lines and strong winds resulted in a 2.6-acre slop over on 10/27 which was contained at 97 acres. 
The Fork Fire started in the Crystal Basin near Gerle Creek under critical fire weather conditions. Driven by east winds gusting 30-50 miles per hour, the fire grew rapidly to the west. It is burning in the Rubicon River drainage and the 2014 King Fire burn scar. The Rubicon canyon is in an extremely steep and remote area which makes firefighting difficult. This area of the King Fire had burned at high severity with nearly 100% tree mortality, leaving large snag patches of fire killed trees. The standing snags are a significant safety hazard, especially in strong winds. There is also a high concentration of dead and down trees creating a heavy fuel load, as well as dense post-fire regrowth of 4-6 foot tall brush.

The fire started on September 12, 2020 near Badger Gulch off Forest Road 533 and 536; the cause is unknown.  High winds and critically dry fuels resulted in extreme fire behavior, including long-range spotting and fire whorls, and caused the fire to grow rapidly.  Command of the Badger Fire will transition back to the Sawtooth National Forest as of 6 a.m. Monday morning. This will be the final update for the Badger fire and all further communications will be handle through the Sawtooth National Forest. Most of the Badger Fire Road, Trail, and Area Closure has been lifted, there are several areas that will remain closed due to unsafe conditions or resource concerns.  The following areas remain closed to the public:
The Rock Creek road up to Diamondfield Jack is all open but the areas to the side of the road are closed. The closure starts at the Forest Boundary to the fire edge at Third Fork Campground due to unsafe recreation facilities and potential for falling rock and debris run off. The public is asked to not stop on the roadway in Lower Rock Creek Canyon. A majority of 50-inch ATV trails and motorcycle trails are closed to protect the existing trail tread from further erosion and damage post fire. Snags are likely to continue to come down after wind and precipitation events. Please see the map for closure areas. 
The BAER team is currently making assessments on the burned area and the Minidoka Ranger District will be working with user groups to assess post fire motorized trail damage as well as potential effects on winter recreation. Reseeding and other stabilization treatments will be occurring in the coming weeks on lands within the fire perimeter.

Valley Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY   
 
There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:   
 Fire Suppression Repair     Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)     Long-Term Recovery and Restoration    
 Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.     Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.     Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

  Steep rugged terrain San Jacinto Wilderness  
On November 16, 2020 San Bernardino National Forest officials announced that the Snow Fire, along with the El Dorado and Apple Fires have reached 100% containment. These fires were previously at 95% containment because uncontained perimeters were located in steep and inaccessible terrain. Containment has now been achieved as fire in uncontained areas has reached natural features void of vegetation.
Although full containment has been reached, the three fires remain in a status called uncontrolled. That means smoldering continues within the interior of the burn scar perimeters.Fire restrictions on the forest will remain in effect until conditions improve, and are listed on the San Bernardino National Forest webpage.

Mullen Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Mullen Fire is burning in the Medicine Bow National Forest (MBF), southwest of Centennial, Wyoming. The fire was reported in the Savage Run Wilderness on Thursday, September 17, and spread rapidly in extremely rugged terrain, with dense vegetation and beetle-killed deadfall. The fire continues to burn and has damaged 66 structures. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Firefighting priorities are public and firefighter safety, the protection of structures and community infrastructure.  Values at risk include multiple communities in the surrounding area and the Rob Roy Reservoir.  Rob Roy Reservoir is the water source for the city of Cheyenne. Regional wildfire resources responded and began fire suppression on the wildfire when it was reported on September 17. The fire continued to grow in complexity requiring elevated incident management. The Rocky Mountain Incident Management Blue Team took command of the fire on September 22. The Southern Area Incident Management Blue Team accepted command on October 6. A Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command on October 24, and a Type 4 MBF Team took command on October 30. The largest spread of the wildfire occurred on Saturday, September 26, when western winds reached 70 mph pushing the fire across the southern portion of Medicine Bow National Forest. On Wednesday, September 30, the fire crossed into northern Colorado creating a more complex fire with additional challenges. The Mullen Fire is a full-suppression fire in which firefighting resources have engaged fire where there has been the highest probability of success. Previous mitigation projects in the Rambler community provided a fuels transition that allowed firefighters to access the fire perimeter more aggressively. Burn scars from the Keystone, Badger Creek and Squirrel Creek fires were critical in slowing the progressing of the fire. The fire has directly impacted several communities, including Albany, Keystone, Lake Creek, Miller Lake, Fox Park and Foxborough and outlining areas. On October 24 and 25 a winter storm brought up to a foot of snow to the fire area, This significantly reduced fire behavior. Despite this snowfall, the area has been locked in a stubborn drought since springtime and currently is experiencing a warming and drying trend. Heavier fuels continue to smolder, and it is likely that sustained heavy snowfall will be needed before the fire is completely out.   On October 28 the last pre-evacuation order was lifted by the Albany County Sheriff.

Cameron Peak Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Cameron Peak Fire was reported on Thursday, August 13 at approximately 1:48 PM. The fire was burning in steep, rugged terrain, approximately 25 miles east of Walden and 15 miles southwest of Red Feather Lakes near Cameron Pass. 
The fire burned through an area of 208,913 acres on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in Larimer and Jackson Counties and Rocky Mountain National Park. 
The cause of the wildfire remains under investigation. Large scale and long duration evacuations took place throughout the fire. 
During the time the Cameron Peak Fire was burning, there was another fire (East Troublesome) burning simultaneously to the west of the Cameron Peak Fire, on the west side of the Continental Divide. On October 22, the East Troublesome Fire spotted over the Continental Divide, and created what became known as the “Thompson Zone” of the East Troublesome Fire. This zone was managed by the Cameron Peak Fire Incident Management Team until November 9, upon which time command returned to the East Troublesome Incident Management Team. 
On the Cameron Peak Fire, extreme temperatures, low humidity, rough terrain and gusty winds reaching over 70 miles per hour were just some of the elements that contributed to extreme fire behavior and rapid rates of spread. A major contributing factor to the large fire growth was the tremendous amount of beetle kill trees and the drought-stricken Ponderosa Pine, Engelmann Spruce and mixed conifer stands available as fuel. 
The heavy concentration of standing bark beetle-killed snags, along with steep, loose terrain made it difficult to get firefighters safely into the fire for direct attack; however, this fire was always managed as a full suppression fire. Firefighters worked to protect homes and outbuildings using a combination of heavy equipment and fire personnel to build fire lines. Road systems were used as control lines where crews initiated firing operations to slow the fire spread. Air support was utilized in fire suppression efforts throughout the incident, but at times was limited due to conditions. 
After 62 days of burning, on October 14, the Cameron Peak Fire became the largest recorded wildfire in Colorado's history, surpassing the Pine Gulch Fire that burned near Grand Junction in 2020. 
On October 18, the Cameron Peak Fire became the first in Colorado history to burn more than 200,000 acres. Prior to 2002, there was never a fire larger than 100,000 acres in Colorado. 
The Larimer County Damage Assessment Teams (DAT) completed assessments of all known structure damage caused by the Cameron Peak Fire on November 6. The Larimer County Sheriff’s Office released the following:

A total of 469 structures were impacted by the fire as follows
• 461 structures destroyed (residential and outbuildings)
• 224 residential structures were destroyed and 4 sustained damage
• 220 outbuilding were destroyed and 4 sustained damage
• 17 business structures were impacted (Shambhala Mountain Center)
• 42 of the residential structures impacted were primary residences 
Dates and locations of damage
• September 7 – Poudre Canyon south of Highway 14 near Archer’s Poudre River Resort and the Monument Gulch area
• September 25 and 26 – Poudre Canyon between the Fish Hatchery and Rustic, the Manhattan Road area, and the Boy Scout Ranch Road area
• October 14 – Upper and Lower Buckhorn areas, Crystal Mountain, Bobcat Ridge, Buckskin Heights, Redstone Canyon, Storm Mountain, The Retreat, and Pingree Park  
Approximately 30,000 acres or 9 percent of Rocky Mountain National Park was impacted by the Cameron Peak Fire, and both the Grand Zone and Thompson Zone of the East Troublesome Fire. 
Over the duration of the Cameron Peak Fire, there have been 10 Incident Management Teams before transferring the fire back to the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland. Teams include six Type 2, three Type 1, and one Type 3. 
Once the Cameron Peak Fire reached 100% containment on December 2, a significant amount of suppression repair work remained. Due to weather conditions, some of the work was delayed until the following spring. 
Resources have traveled from over 46 states and Puerto Rico to work on the Cameron Peak Fire  
Timeline of Major Events: 
The Cameron Peak Fire was reported on Thursday, August 13, at approximately 1:48 PM. 
Between September 4 and September 7, the fire grew over 78,000 acres in a 3-day period. 
On the evening of September 8, 8-14 inches of snow fell and temporarily halted the growth of the Cameron Peak Fire at 102,596 acres. Authorities were hopeful the snow would help firefighters focus on problem areas. The moisture lasted for two days before temperatures began to warm up and dry out, bringing an increase in fire activity. 
The next period of record-breaking critical growth was from October 13 through October 18. 70+ mile per hour winds drove the fire over 68,000 acres eastward during these 6 days. 
·       On October 14, after 62 days of burning, the Cameron Peak Fire became the largest recorded wildfire in Colorado's history, surpassing the Pine Gulch Fire that burned 139,007 acres near Grand Junction in 2020.  The Cameron Peak Fire would measure at 164,140 acres by the end of the day.
·       On October 18, the Cameron Peak Fire became the first in Colorado history to burn more than 200,000 acres. 
On October 22, the East Troublesome Fire spotted into Rocky Mountain National Park, between the Continental Divide and Estes Park. Due to this threat, evacuations were put into place for Estes Park. This spot, which was called the Thompson Zone, was subsequently placed under the command of the Cameron Peak Fire Incident Management Team. 
On October 24 and 25, a winter storm brought 8-18 inches of snow across the entire fire area. This season-slowing event helped firefighters increase containment. 
On November 2, the Cameron Peak Fire grew to 208,913 acres.

This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.    Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds; and protect critical cultural resources.    Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

Williams Fork Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Williams Fork Fire was first reported on Aug. 14 at approximately noon and the cause is still under investigation. The origination point was 15 miles southwest of Fraser, Colo. in the Arapaho National Forest. The fire grew in size to 6,122 acres by the end of August 16th, and became a threat to the communities of Fraser and Winter Park.
The fuels consisted of heavy dead and down beetle killed lodgepole pine and during the first week low relativity humidity of around 10 to 30 percent contributed to fire growth and behavior. After the initial three-day fire growth, the peak fire spread occurred on Aug. 20 reached 1,977 acres with a total size of 9,444.Over the next two months, the daily fire spread was limited to between 1 and 561 acres and the fire reached it’s current size of 14,833 acres on October 27th and was declared controlled after an infrared flight Nov. 30 detected no remaining heat in the fire area.

Seven Springs Road and Horseshoe Dam Road Reopen  PHOENIX, Oct. 4, 2020 –Management of the Sears Fire will transition back to the Cave Creek Ranger District at 6 p.m., Sunday evening. This will be the final news update unless there are significant changes in fire activity. The fire remains at 14,476 acres and is 60 percent contained. Residents and visitors to the area may see occasional smoke over the next several days as interior pockets of vegetation continue to burn within the fire perimeter. Large ash whirls (similar to dust devils) are frequently seen within the burned area as well. Firefighters continue to monitor areas around critical infrastructure on Humboldt Lookout and are closely monitoring structures in the Camp Creek recreation residences. Road grading to repair impacts from firefighting vehicles on Seven Springs Road (NFSR 24) and Horseshoe Road (NFSR 205) was completed over the weekend. There are approximately 60 personnel assigned to the incident consisting of engines, hand crews, water tenders and helicopters.  The Sears Fire Closure Order has been modified to reopen Seven Springs Road (NFSR 24) and Horseshoe Dam Road (NFSR 205). Bartlett Dam Road, Bartlett Lake recreation sites and marina are also open. Please slow down and watch out for firefighters and equipment that are working in the area.  The Maricopa Trail segment from Bronco Trailhead to Bartlett Dam Road remains closed as is runs though the center of the fire closure area. For more information about Maricopa Trails visit https://bit.ly/34bxqD4.  The closure order shall remain in effect until further notice and the signed closure order, closure area map and available photos can be viewed and downloaded at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7218/. Any changes or lifting of the closure order will be posted on Inciweb and to the Tonto National Forest official Facebook page.

Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.     Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

The decrease in containment numbers was due to miscommunication between the Encinos and Espinosa Fires. Cooler overnight temperatures and increased relative humidity have significantly reduced fire behavior. Line is holding on all sides of the fire and firefighters are confident the incoming wind event should not impact the fire's activity or cause any control problems. Today, crews will continue to patrol and monitor line as the fire does continue to smolder in some areas and is expected to make some uphill runs within pockets of unburned fuels. The threat to structures and area infrastructure has greatly decreased.

There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:   
 Fire Suppression Repair     Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)     Long-Term Recovery and Restoration    
 Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.     Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events.

East Troublesome Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The East Troublesome Fire was reported on the afternoon of October 14. The origination point was northeast of Kremmling in Grand County, Colo. on the Arapaho National Forest. The cause is still under investigation. Within three days, high winds and low humidity allowed the fire to spread to over 10,000 acres. The direction of fire spread threatened State Highway 125 and forced the closure of the road and mandatory evacuation of approximately 90 homes by October 17.Between Oct. 20-23, the fire spread increased dramatically with 24-hour increases of around 18,000 to 87,000 acres during the four-day run. The peak fire spread of 87,093 acres occurred between late afternoon on Oct. 21 and the early afternoon of Oct. 22. The size of the fire exploded from 18,550 acres to 187,964 acres during this period. The fire crossed Highway 125 on the afternoon of Oct. 21 and spread eastward into the Rocky Mountain National Park on Oct. 22, crossing the Continental Divide and reaching the western edge of Estes Park on Oct. 23.The fire was fueled by wide-spread drought, numerous dead and down beetle-killed trees, red flag weather conditions created by high winds and dry conditions, and poor humidity recovery overnight. The combination of these factors led to unprecedented, wind-driven, active fire behavior with rapid spread during the overnight hours. During this period the area north of US Highway 40 from near Granby and extending eastward to Grand Lake and Estes Park had over 7,000 structures threatened, and a population of over 35,000 placed under a mandatory evacuation.A winter storm from Saturday, Oct. 24 through the morning of Oct. 26 brought very cold temperatures, precipitation in the form of snow and lighter winds, resulting in a dramatic drop in fire behavior with smoldering and reduced fire spread on both sides of the Continental Divide. Over this 3-day period, fire growth fell to a total of around 4,500 acres for a total of 192,457 acres. From that point forward, fire activity remained minimal with little change in area and a final total acreage of 193,812. The fire was declared contained on Nov. 30, 2020. Land managers have turned their attention to post wildfire emergency response and recovery efforts. Impacted areas included the Arapaho & Roosevelt National Forests, Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests, Bureau of Land Management, Rocky Mountain National Park, and private lands. A preliminary estimate of 366 residences and 214 outbuildings and commercial structures were destroyed or damaged. Portions of these areas remain closed for public safety due to snag trees and other hazards.More information about post fire efforts can be found at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7267/.

They were assisted by a helicopter doing bucket work in the rugged terrain on the northside of the fire by Highway 7. The #CalWood Fire will have another infrared flight tonight to assess heat in the fire as the snow begins to melt. Friday firefighters will continue to use information from the infrared flight to identify isolated hotspots and continue mop-up work to further secure firelines using aircraft as needed. Firefighters will continue to monitor weather forecasts and prepare for potential fire spread as snow continues to melt off of the fire over the next several days. 
10/29/2020 AM:
The #CalWood Fire is now being managed by a local Type 3 Team led by Incident Commander (IC) Tim Griffin and IC Trainee Seth McKinney. Staff on the fire today include seven engine modules, two 10-person initial attack module and a helicopter with a helitack module. Firefighters are using information from the infrared flight to develop a strategy to address isolated hot spots that may need further work within the fire perimeter. They are patrolling the fire and mopping-up to further secure the fire as the snowy conditions allow. Containment remains at 76 percent due the uncontained portion of the fire that is in steep rugged inaccessible terrain along Highway 7. Firefighters are assessing the effects of the snow and developing strategies for that section. 
Some smoke may be visible today. Watch out for firefighters and fire equipment that will be working around the fire area and along Highway 7.  Please help us keep our firefighters safe by slowing down and using extra caution when driving near the fire area.

Luna Fire ,"

The Luna Fire started on Oct. 17, 2020, approximately two miles north of Chacon, NM. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation. Fuels are primarily mixed conifer tapering to ponderosa pine at lower elevations and light grass in open areas. Fire behavior has ranged from moderate to extreme, driven by terrain and winds. Firefighters are continuing fire suppression efforts to protect values at risk and strengthen containment lines. Without the traditional monsoon season, fuel moistures are very low for this time of year and other fire indices are unseasonably high. Due to the complexity of the Luna Fire and values at risk, the Carson National Forest and New Mexico State Forestry Division ordered additional resources. On Oct. 31, Carson National Forest Incident Commander assumed command of the fire from the California Incident Management Team 5, led by Incident Commander Rick Young. If any activity changes, the Carson National Forest will provide information on Inciweb, the Carson National Forest social media accounts and New Mexico Fire Information.

The Point Fire remains at 93 acres with 97% Containment. Containment lines continue to hold as fire personnel continue with mop up and control any hot spots that are still smoldering and burning as it is safe to do so. There are still many standing snags creating hazard conditions for fire personnel still assigned to the incident. Rehab and repair for the Point Fire is to be completed on mechanically created fire lines. This is done using a dozer or excavator to pull the soils back to restore original landscape and by using brush, limbs, poles, and logs placing them into naturally appearing arrangements. The Objectives remain the same to provide for fire fighter safety & to protect private and public lands. 

 
The Point Fire began On October 26 at 6:00 AM off Nevada Point Rd and Long Creek Rd, north of Ellicott Bridge in the Georgetown RD of the Eldorado National Forest. Eldorado NF and Cal Fire resources responded to the incident. It is located within the 2014 King Fire Footprint creating standing snag hazard conditions hampering containment of fire lines. The fire remained a concern during the recent Red Flag wind events with no significant growth.

Kootenai Fuels Prescribed Fire,"

English Point and Canfield Mountain Pile Burning  The Coeur d’Alene River Ranger District of the Idaho Panhandle National Forests will be burning piles associated with the Kootenai Fuel Reduction Project. Interagency crews will be working to burn slash piles on Canfield Mountain and English Point from over 600 acres of pruning, thinning, and brushing work completed earlier this year. There are other smaller prescribed fire units north Rose Lake, and along the southeast side of Hayden Lake. Hazardous fuels reduction in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) comprises National Forest System lands adjacent to private property and the protection of emergency services communication infrastructure on Canfield Butte.  Hunters: if you see piles in the area, know that your hunt may be inadvertently disturbed by prescribed fire activity. This burning activity should have minimal, localized smoke impacts, and will not interfere with travel on-Forest. Smoke will be highly visible from Coeur d’Alene, especially near Canfield Mountain and the English Point Recreation Area.  The Kootenai Fuel Reduction project is a multi-year project that will treat approximately 3,000 acres in the WUI of Kootenai County. Fuel reduction work helps limit the spread of uncontrolled wildfires that can threaten values such as property and structures on both public and private land.

Sourdough Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]               Beaverhead County, Mont., November 1st, 2020 — Fire crews continue conducting burnout operations and securing the perimeter today on the Sourdough Fire, which is now 75 percent contained and approximately 5,811 acres.  Decrease in acreage is due to accurate mapping.              Including the Sourdough Fire, Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (BDNF) fire personnel and dispatchers are responding to five fires within the forest currently. A recent change in weather has quickly diminished any beneficial moisture from recent snowfall.  Varying wind speed and direction, along with an increase in activity due to the opening of rifle season just over a week ago, are all factors affecting the current fire situation.             Many BDNF fire crews recently arrived back from assisting fire fighting efforts throughout the nation and are now working hard on fire suppression and containment efforts in several places within the forest as we enter November. Earlier last week, many BDNF personnel reported finding abandoned, active campfires and BDNF is asking the public to be especially conscious of making sure campfires are completely extinguished as they enjoy public lands.             No structures are currently threatened, and no closures are in place at this time. Local landowners have been instrumental in supporting fire crews and facilitating a rapid response to mitigate potential threats and assist Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest personnel. The cause of the fire is under investigation.              For further information and questions, please contact the Dillon Ranger District at (406) 683-3900.

Woodhead BAER,"

  The Woodhead Fire burned almost 100,000 acres to date and is now 100% contained. The burned area is located east of Council, Idaho including lands in the Payette National Forest. Starting September 28, a team of Forest Service specialists conducted field assessments to determine the need for burned area emergency response (BAER) treatments. Specialists included hydrology, soils, engineering, botany, range, recreation, fisheries, archeology, and wildlife. BAER is a specific effort to reduce further damage due to the land being temporarily exposed in a fragile condition. Loss of vegetation exposes soil to erosion; water runoff may increase and cause flooding; sediment may move downstream and damage houses or fill reservoirs, putting habitat and community water supplies at risk. The BAER program is designed to address these situations through the key goals of protecting life, property, water quality, and deteriorated ecosystems.  Led by West Zone Hydrologist Melanie Vining, the Woodhead Fire BAER Team uses satellite imagery of the burned area to classify the landscape into low, moderate, and high soil burn severity. The fire on the forest burned in a mosaic pattern with most of the burned area classified as unburned, low severity, or moderate severity. The burned area was initially classified using the satellite imagery and adjustments in classification were made based on ground surveys to yield a final soil burn severity map.   The entire burned area is mapped, though the field work and treatments identified by the Forest Service BAER Team are limited to only the acres of burned area on the Payette National Forest. A BAER Plan summarizing the assessment results and describing the proposed treatments has been prepared and is pending approval. Approved treatments will be implemented over the next 12 months using federal dollars on federal lands. Areas of concern for watershed impacts are in places that experienced higher burn severity, namely in Crooked River, No Business Basin, and Brownlee Creek.  After the fire burn severity map is completed and the BAER treatment plan is approved additional information will be provided to the public. While the BAER program does not prescribe treatments on non-federal lands, the assessment and hydrologic risk analysis can be useful to adjacent and downstream landowners to inform their own range of possible treatments. The Woodhead BAER team continues to share information with County officials and other agencies who in turn coordinate with affected landowners.

2020-21 Royal Gorge FO Pile Burns,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Bureau of Land Management is preparing to conduct pile burns in nine locations this winter (see articles for location details). Pile burns could occur as early as November 2021 or any time through March 2022, depending on favorable weather and fuel moisture conditions. The purpose of the pile burns is to remove slash left behind from timber harvests and previous fuels-thinning treatments. These timber harvests and fuels treatments remove beetle-killed timber and other woody fuels, reducing the risk of future catastrophic wildfire. They also help create various stages of plant succession, which is critical to the health of fire-adapted ecosystems. Visible smoke from the pile burns should be expected throughout the day when burning, mostly during the warmest part of the day. With cooler evening temperatures, smoke may linger and accumulate in low-lying areas. Signage will be posted around areas where burning is occurring.

East Troublesome Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The East Troublesome Fire was reported on the afternoon of October 14. The origination point was northeast of Kremmling in Grand County, Colo. on the Arapaho National Forest. The cause is still under investigation. Within three days, high winds and low humidity allowed the fire to spread to over 10,000 acres. The direction of fire spread threatened State Highway 125 and forced the closure of the road and mandatory evacuation of approximately 90 homes by October 17.
Between Oct. 20-23, the fire spread increased dramatically with 24-hour increases of around 18,000 to 87,000 acres during the four-day run. The peak fire spread of 87,093 acres occurred between late afternoon on Oct. 21 and the early afternoon of Oct. 22. The size of the fire exploded from 18,550 acres to 187,964 acres during this period. The fire crossed Highway 125 on the afternoon of Oct. 21 and spread eastward into the Rocky Mountain National Park on Oct. 22, crossing the Continental Divide and reaching the western edge of Estes Park on Oct. 23.
The fire was fueled by wide-spread drought, numerous dead and down beetle-killed trees, red flag weather conditions created by high winds and dry conditions, and poor humidity recovery overnight. The combination of these factors led to unprecedented, wind-driven, active fire behavior with rapid spread during the overnight hours. During this period the area north of US Highway 40 from near Granby and extending eastward to Grand Lake and Estes Park had over 7,000 structures threatened, and a population of over 35,000 placed under a mandatory evacuation.
A winter storm from Saturday, Oct. 24 through the morning of Oct. 26 brought very cold temperatures, precipitation in the form of snow and lighter winds, resulting in a dramatic drop in fire behavior with smoldering and reduced fire spread on both sides of the Continental Divide. Over this 3-day period, fire growth fell to a total of around 4,500 acres for a total of 192,457 acres. From that point forward, fire activity remained minimal with little change in area and a final total acreage of 193,812. The fire was declared contained on Nov. 30, 2020.
Land managers have turned their attention to post wildfire emergency response and recovery efforts. Impacted areas included the Arapaho & Roosevelt National Forests, Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests, Bureau of Land Management, Rocky Mountain National Park, and private lands. A preliminary estimate of 366 residences and 214 outbuildings and commercial structures were destroyed or damaged. Portions of these areas remain closed for public safety due to snag trees and other hazards. 
THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands: 
Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds; and protect critical cultural resources.Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

Shasta-Trinity RX Burning 2020/2021,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]See the 'Announcements' and 'News' Tabs for the latest information on current prescribed burns. 
 As temperatures drop and the first precipitation of the season arrives, the Shasta-Trinity National Forest begins conducting its fall, winter and spring prescribed fire projects.  Pre-planned prescribed fire projects may take place at specific locations across the forest from November 2020 through June 2021. Actual project ignition will depend upon local weather and fuel conditions. Planned projects include burning piles as well as low-intensity understory burns of vegetation on the forest floor. The main goals of these projects are to reduce the severity of future wildfires and to provide added protection for communities in the wildland urban interface. In addition, prescribed burns promote a diverse and more resilient forest and improve habitat for wildlife.  “With the onset of cool temperatures and recent wet weather, our first prescribed fire projects are being planned north and east of McCloud,” explained Prescribed Fire & Fuels Specialist Heather McRae. “These projects are conducted in accordance with an approved burn plan to ensure the safety of people and property in the area. Burn plans describe the specific conditions under which burns will be conducted including the weather, number of personnel and opportunities to minimize smoke impacts.”  Pre-ignition public notifications will be provided to local media outlets and will also be posted on the Forest’s www.facebook.com/ShastaTrinityNF and www.twitter.com/ShastaTrinityNF pages. Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed burns are being conducted. People may see or smell smoke, though should not be alarmed. The fires are carefully monitored. Local fire and government authorities are notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout burning operations.  Following is a list of prescribed fire projects currently planned for this fall, winter and spring: National Recreation Area (NRA – Shasta Lake area): O’Brien Mtn. near Packers Bay, northeast of Jones Valley between Squaw and Pit arm of Shasta Lake, west of Lakeshore between Charlie Creek and Little Dog Creek, north of Lakeshore along Forest Road, in Lakeshore area proper off of Lakeshore drive and near Antlers marina and west of Jones Valley in the Silverthorn area.

Klamath NF RX Burning 2020/2021,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Fire officials on the Klamath National Forest are preparing for spring prescribed burns on the Salmon/Scott River and Goosenest Ranger Districts between now and June 2021. The actual dates of ignition will depend on local weather and fuel conditions.
Planned projects include burning piles of stacked materials and low- to moderate-intensity understory burns of vegetation on the forest floor. The main goals of these projects are to reduce the severity of future wildfires and provide added protection for communities in the wildland urban interface. In addition, the burns will promote a diverse and more resilient forest and improve habitat for wildlife.
In order to meet future wildfire challenges in the most effective way possible, the Forest will continue to use prescribed burning as a tool in our mission to reduce build-up of hazardous fuels, restore forest ecosystems, and improve resiliency and safety of communities within the wildland urban interface.
All prescribed fire projects will be conducted in accordance with an approved burn plan to ensure the safety of people and property in the area. Burn plans describe the specific conditions under which burns will be conducted including the weather, number of personnel, and opportunities to minimize smoke impacts.
Visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed burns are being conducted. Some spur roads near the burn areas may be inaccessible during operations. As a result of the burns, some residents and visitors may see or smell smoke. They may also witness glowing from the fires at night. People should not be alarmed; the fires will be carefully monitored. Local authorities will be notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout burning operations.

CalWood and Lefthand Post-Fire BAER,"

THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY  There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:     Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts. Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds; and protect critical cultural resources. Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

2022 Humboldt-Toiyabe Prescribed Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Planned Projects | Current Projects | Current Photos
As part of Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest’s hazardous fuels reduction efforts, crews will conduct prescribed fire across pre-planned locations across the forest as weather and fuel conditions permit. Prescribed fire is a proactive tool used to achieve a number of purposes, including the reduction of hazardous fuels, which decreases the threat of high intensity, high-severity wildfires. It also reduces the risk of insect and disease outbreak, recycles nutrients that increase soil productivity and improves wildlife habitat. The actual days of ignition for prescribed burning will depend on several factors including appropriate humidity levels, wind speed and direction, temperature, and fuel moisture. Burns only occur on days when weather conditions exist for good smoke dispersal. 
 Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed burns are being conducted. Smoke may be visible, but these fires are all carefully monitored and local fire departments  are aware of prescribed fire activity. Get updates on prescribed burns on the Forest's Facebook and Twitter pages:Humboldt-Toiyabe NF Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/HumboldtToiyabeNF/ Humboldt-Toiyabe Twitter: https://twitter.com/HumboldtToiyabe For a list of prescribed fire projects currently planned for 2022 (to be implemented as local weather and fuel conditions allow), please go to the Planned Project List. To learn more about the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest's prescribed fire program, please visit: https://bit.ly/HTNFPrescribedFire.An ArcGIS StoryMap that explains how prescribe fire is good for the National Forest System land can be viewed at  https://bit.ly/PrescribedFireStoryMap.

Cleveland RX Burning 2021,"

The Cleveland National Forest will conduct prescribed burning from January to May 2021, if weather and fuel moisture conditions permit. The objectives of the projects are to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire to people and communities, create conditions which offer a safer and more effective wildfire response, foster more resilient ecosystems, and minimize the effects of large wildfires on the landscape.When implementing these projects, fire managers follow a burn plan that outlines the “prescription” or environmental conditions such as temperature, wind, fuel moisture, ventilation and relative humidity that need to be present before the project begins. When the criteria are met, crews implement, monitor, and patrol each burn to ensure it meets the goals and objectives outlined by managers. The prescribed fire program will continue through the winter and spring months as permitted by weather and other environmental factors.Trabuco Ranger District: Plans between 400 and 700 acres around the communities of Rancho Capistrano, Long Canyon, Silverado, El Cariso, Temescal and Corona. Heavy smoke may be visible from surrounding communities.Palomar Ranger District: Plans between 500 and 600 acres in 2021, mainly in the areas of Fry Creek/ Palomar Mountain and on the Palomar Divide.Descanso Ranger District: Plans between 300 and 700 acres. The Lake Morena prescribed burn is located in the surrounding community of Lake Morena. Piles will be burned within a fuel break around the community Lake Morena. The area consists of cut and piled chaparral and coastal sage scrub. The piles will be burned in blocks as weather and conditions permit. The prescribed pile burns on Mount Laguna will be conducted in several different areas, Escondido Ravine, Los Huecos Road, Thing Valley, Kitchen creek rd. The fuels consist of cut and piled chaparral in some units and timber litter in others. Proposed broadcast burns in the areas of Old County Road, Chico and Gatos trails, and Los Huecos Road, Horse Heaven Campground. The burns will assist in community protection as well as limiting the severity of a wildfire during the summer months. These burns are being conducted to promote forest health. The prescribed areas will be burned in blocks as weather and conditions permit. Some drifting smoke may be visible during the period of burning along Sunrise Highway, Buckman Springs Road, Interstate 8, and within the community of Lake Morena.Residents in the area should call their local district office for more information on burn projects.

KRRD 2021 Prescribed Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]  8 slash piles completed on the Havilah Work Center compound, 3/18/2021.
District 2020-2021 Prescribed Burn News Release, dated Jan. 2021:News Release - January 28, 2021:  Hazardous Fuels Reduction projects are scheduled this winter on two mountaintops within the Kern River Ranger District on the Sequoia National Forest. 
Projects will also be along the Kern River corridor and many Forest Service stations and work centers.  All projects are subject to meeting weather and air quality conditions. Burns may commence as early as next week.   The Greenhorn Mountain projects are adjacent to the community of Alta Sierra and south of Shirley Meadow. The Penny Pines project will consist of 14 acres of pile burning.  Pile burning will also take place in the Black Mountain Saddle area.  Broadcast burns may take place off the Shirley Loop Road, southeast of Shirley Meadows. Fuel reduction in the form of mastication and several other piles burn areas will be taking place during 2021. The Breckenridge projects consist of pile burning located in the Havilah Work Center's vicinity and sub-division and along the 28S06 Rd North of Squirrel Meadows. The forest surrounding the communities of Greenhorn and Breckenridge are overly dense, have high amounts of hazardous fuels, and represent an increased risk of hazard. Fuel reduction activities will have beneficial impacts on health and safety in the project areas by reducing the risk of a stand-replacing fire and restoring natural ecosystems while improving public safety. Forest Service crews have been working in preparing fire lines and cutting ladder fuels to prepare for burning this winter.  Prep work is necessary to ensure the project work is accomplished safely and to provide control measures.  The plan includes both pile and understory burning. Understory burns are controlled fires that consume surface fuels but not the overstory canopy. The Kern River Ranger District expects to burn 300-500 acres this year in small units designed to minimize the effects of smoke on the community while reducing the potential for large, stand-replacing wildfires.  Acreage may change due to burning conditions.  Any broadcast burns will be performed in the fall.  Smoke will be visible from several communities surrounding Isabella Lake.    Fire managers will work closely with the Eastern Mojave and San Joaquin County Air Pollution Control Boards to manage smoke production and reduce local impacts. Prescribed burn efforts will continue throughout the winter as weather and available resources permit. We will make every attempt to broadcast individual burn days/locations as they commence. Please contact the Kern River Ranger District Fuels Officer, John Lange, at (760) 376-3781, extension 656 for more information. ####

WDRD Prescribed Burning,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Efforts continue to prescribe burn hand piles at the Trail of 100 Giants on the Western Divide Ranger District. To date, 806 piles have been burned with an additional 300 snow covered piles that will be targeted this week.  There is still a great amount of snow accumulated throughout the area along with high relative humidity making ignitions a little more challenging during the early morning hours. Fire personnel tactically concentrated efforts on the south part of the Trail that was more exposed. 
 Good smoke dispersion was observed as the piles burned down to the desired consumption goals to meet burn plan objectives. Cleanup efforts will be done on approximately 60 acres and continue as weather, fuel, and smoke conditions permit.  
 For many years, Forest officials have worked to reduce the number of dead or dying trees at risk of falling onto this popular Trail. Tree species that succumbed to drought and other natural causes were predominantly white fir, sugar pine, ponderosa pine, and incense cedar.  Many of the dead trees were large, and could seriously injure visitors, damage the trail infrastructure, or even damage the giant sequoias should they fall. 
Numerous trees were successfully felled last summer, leaving behind unsightly debris that was piled and prepped for removal by prescribed fire when conditions allowed. “Extraordinary efforts to alleviate these hazards at the Trail of 100 Giants have been going on for years,” stated District Ranger Eric LaPrice. “Forest Service employees are determined to clean up this popular attraction to make it available for our visitors. Thank you to Forest Service personnel that have contributed to the prescribe burn efforts.”

Payette NF 2021 Fall Prescribed Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] PRESCRIBED FIRE
 Promoting fire-adapted communities and resilient landscapes
The Payette National Forest will be conducting multiple prescribed fires this fall.  Depending on weather conditions burns could take place anytime from late September to early November. 
These prescribed fires reduce surface fuels, increase height of the canopy, reduce small tree densities, and promote fire resilient trees, thereby improving our ability to protect communities from wildfire. Additionally, these fires improve wildlife habitat, promote long-term ecosystem integrity and sustainability by reducing the risk of high-severity wildland fire. Prescribed fire is an important component of natural resource management and part of the comprehensive fire management program on the Payette National Forest. 
The New Meadows Ranger District plans to burn approximately 3,000 acres in Boulder Creek drainage (13 miles northwest of New Meadows); 150 acres of hand piles in the Weiser River canyon area. (2 miles south of Tamarack Mill), and up to 100 landing piles in the Rusty Goose Timber Sale (3 miles east of New Meadows) 
The McCall Ranger District plans to burn 1,000 acres of broadcast hand piles in the Brundage-Bear Basin project area. (3 miles northwest of McCall). 
The Council Ranger District plans to apply fire to approximately 1,500 acres in the Weasel project area (13 miles northwest of Council, and 3,000 acres in Mill Creek-Council Mountain project area (5 miles northeast of Council). 
The Weiser Ranger District plans to apply fire to approximately 1,200 acres in the Robinson project area (22 miles north of Weiser). 
The Krassel Ranger District plans to apply fire to approximately 5,500 acres within the Bald Hill project area (east of Yellow Pine); 3,800 acres in the Four Mile project area along the South Fork of the Salmon River near the 4 mile camp ground (Approximately 18 miles east of McCall); and 70 acres around Krassel Work Center. 
Trail heads and roads that lead into these areas will be posted with caution signs and a map of the prescribed burn locations. Fire personnel will work closely with the Idaho/Montana Airshed Group, the National Weather Service, and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to ensure that smoke impacts are minimized. The decision to ignite on any given day will depend on favorable weather conditions and the need to reduce smoke effects as much as possible. Smoke from these prescribed fires will be much less than what would be expected from a wildfire. If smoke concentrations approach air quality standards fire ignition may be delayed until air quality improves. Residual smoke may be visible for up to 2 weeks following ignition, but most of the smoke from the fires is anticipated to dissipate 1-2 days after ignition. 
Individuals may contact Patrick Schon (208-634-0623) all with any concerns they may have about the planned prescribed fires. The public may also call the Weiser, Council, New Meadows, McCall, or Krassel Ranger Districts for more information. Council RD: 253-0100; Krassel RD: 634-0974; McCall RD: 634-0400; New Meadows RD: 347-0300; Weiser RD: 549-4200.

McKenzie Ranch,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Prescribed burning began Thursday Feb 25 along Highway 180 six miles east of Dunlap on the McKenzie Ranch Fuels Reduction Project. 85 acres were successfully ignited Thursday, 224 acres Friday and the remaining 191 acres were burned on Saturday, completing the ignition part of the project. Crews continue to patrol and monitor the burn perimeter to ensure no fire spread outside the planned units. Dry weather is allowing fire to creep slowly through pockets of vegetation laying on the ground. This is expected and a desired fire effect that further meets objectives within the burn unit. Smoke from the prescribed burn operations will linger along roads and in nearby communities. “The objective of this understory prescribed burn was to reduce fuels and continue reintroducing fire into the wildland urban interface,” stated District Ranger Jeremy Dorsey. Personnel from the Sequoia National Forest, Terra Fuego Resource Foundation Inc., CalFire, PG&E, Caltrans, and California Highway Patrol worked together to accomplish the project. This multi-year project began in 2019. There were three fuels reduction units totaling 726 acres, 226 acres were completed in 2019-20 with the remaining acres ignited over the past week.

Waco Wetlands Prescribed Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Texas A&M Forest Service (TFS) is conducting a 130 acre prescribed burn at the Waco Wetlands. The burn site is located 3.0 miles south of China Spring, TX off N. River Crossing and Eichelberger Crossing Road. The objectives of the burn are to reduce brush density, and favor vegetation that is representative a native Texas wetland. Prescribed fire is a preventative tool that reduces hazardous fuel build up, recycles nutrients back into the soil and promotes growth of healthy native trees, wildflowers and other plants. TFS is monitoring weather conditions and will schedule the burn when the weather and fuel conditions meet prescription. Weather for prescribed burns are favorable when the wind will help lift and disperse the smoke. The Lake Waco Wetlands were constructed as a habitat mitigation project that began in 2001 in response to the rising water level of the lake. By establishing these wetlands, many ecological benefits including water filtration, improved habitat for native animals and plants, and erosion control are created. To help maintain and improve these healthy wetlands,  TFS has partnered with the City of Waco to use prescribed fire to reduce the invasive willow tree population that has encroached on the wetlands over the years. Reducing the invasive willow tree population will allocate more resources such as water, space, and sunlight to native plant species that play a more valuable ecological role.    Residents and visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed burns are being conducted. Smoke may be visible, but these fires are all carefully monitored and local fire departments are aware of prescribed fire activity.

Middle Mountain Prescribed Burn,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] 
This spring Monongahela National Forest officials plan to conduct a prescribed burn on 411 acres of National Forest System land in the Middle Mountain project area, south of Minnehaha Springs in Pocahontas County.  Why do we burn? 
Reintroducing fire into the forest will:  Restore historic fire regimesImprove wildlife habitatEnhance forest structure and age diversityImprove oak regenerationControl tree diseases and insectsReduce hazardous fuel levels The Middle Mountain project area consists of both forested and grassy savannah habitats. Eastern wild turkey and their young use savannah habitat to forage for insects in the late spring and summer months. During the rest of the year, their primary food source are acorns found in the forested habitat. Prescribed fire helps to maintain both habitat types. How do we manage a prescribed burn? 
Fire managers prepare a burn plan for each prescribed burn describing the appropriate conditions needed to conduct the burn safely and achieve the desired results. Burn plans consider public safety, protection of private property, staffing and equipment needs, temperature, humidity, wind, moisture of the vegetation, and conditions for the dispersal of smoke. Appropriate conditions must be met before igniting prescribed burns. A control line is established around each burn area before ignition, using hand tools and other equipment, roads, trails, and natural features such as creeks and other water sources. Public Safety 
Each burn area will be closed to the public on the day of the burn. The area may be closed for several days for public safety. Signs will be posted along the fire line and at entry points into the area. Area residents and travelers may see or smell smoke during fire operations. If you encounter smoke on the highway, slow down, turn on your vehicle’s lights and drive appropriately for the conditions.  Public Notification
The Forest Service will notify local 911 centers and radio stations on the day of the burn. Information, maps and the latest updates are available at inciweb.gov.  Contact

Post-harvest slash treatment – reduce residual slash created by thinning operations and personal use firewood cutting.   For public safety, recreationists are asked to be aware of fire crews and vehicles in these areas.  The public is also asked to avoid traveling in prescribed burn units while crews are present, as well as trails and roads directly adjacent to the units.  Please take caution as roads and trails used as control lines for the burn could be temporarily impacted by low intensity fire and smoke.         Fire managers plan to conduct the burning as quickly as possible to limit impacts to recreational users and the general public.  Overnight, there is potential for smoke to settle into the bottom of valleys and corridors that may cause short term smoke impacts for residents and travel.  The smoke is typically visible for a short duration, 1-2 days, and burns are approved in coordination with the Montana DEQ to minimize impacts to communities.

George Washington Jefferson NFs Rx Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] All prescribed burning is complete for the 2021 Spring season. Additional burns are planned for the Fall of 2021.  Fire Managers are conducting prescribed burns at various locations within the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests this spring.  Safety is our top priority. Experienced fire managers create a burn plan for each prescribed burn, closely monitor local weather conditions such as wind and humidity, and adjust the burning schedule as needed to ensure the safety of both crewmembers and local residents. Prior to lighting a burn, crews construct and designate firebreaks to keep fire within the identified burn area. Contingency plans, additional personnel, and equipment are also in place for any unexpected events. Burn areas, including nearby roads and trails, will be temporarily closed for public safety while burns are active. Residents and travelers in the vicinity of prescribed burns may see or smell smoke.  Historically, fire has shaped our forests and maintained the overall health of the Appalachian landscape. Prescribed fire creates young forest and open woodland habitat, which has diminished in recent decades and is needed by birds, wildlife and plants to thrive. Prescribed fire also promotes the regeneration of oaks, hickories, and yellow pine by reducing competition from fire intolerant species, such as red maple. The US Forest Service works with partners to conduct prescribed burns that mimic natural fires, which provide numerous benefits in achieving diverse and healthy landscapes by:  • Reducing hazardous fuels and protecting communities from wildfire • Minimizing the spread of pest insects and disease • Providing forage for game  • Improving habitat for threatened and endangered species • Recycling nutrients back into the soil • Promoting the growth of trees, wildflowers, and other plants • And much more . . .

GMUG Prescribed Fire Program,"

The Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests Fire Management Officials are planning several prescribed burns this spring. The vegetation treatments will occur March through June depending upon weather and appropriate ground and vegetation conditions. Prescribed fire projects are weather dependent and may take several weeks to complete. The prescribed burns will be accomplished using joint-agency fire resources, mitigation measures and protocols that are in place to reduce the risk and transmission of COVID-19.  Reintroduction of fire is necessary to improve and restore vegetative conditions. This effort will reduce hazardous ground fuels, lessen the risk of unplanned large-scale wildfire, help restore ecosystems and improve wildlife habitat. Prescribed fire helps with reducing the ladder fuels that can carry fire into the canopy, killing mature trees. Prescribed fire in these areas will burn with less intensity under moderated conditions which will improve the resiliency of the landscape against wildfire. Safety of firefighters and the public are the most important factors considered when planning a prescribed burn. Fire Management Officers and Fuels Specialists spend countless hours developing detailed prescribed fire plans that detail specific weather, fuel conditions and staffing and safety requirements. Ignitions will occur using ground and aerial techniques. Ignitions only occur if conditions are conductive to a safe, effective operation and within appropriate smoke dispersal parameters set by the State of Colorado. Air quality will be closely monitored to mitigate smoke related impacts to communities.   For more information on how prescribed burning and pile burning smoke may affect your health, please visit: https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health.

Margo Fire ,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Firefighters have the Margo Fire 100% contained at 1,148 acres. The fire has been put in monitor status and the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management has turned it back over to the Dudleyville Fire District. As of Saturday, all residents of Dudleyville were able to return home. There are no road closures in the area. 
The Margo Fire started around 9am, Thursday, April 8th within the Gila River bottom near Dudleyville in Pinal County. Hot and dry conditions, dense fuel, and windy conditions challenged firefighters throughout the day.

South Rim 4,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The South Rim 4 fire was declared ""out"" on June 1, 2021. 
Immediate hazards have been mitigated. Tree mortality will continue to be monitored and mitigated as needed. Temporary hazard awareness signs have been placed in around the burn area. Permanent aluminum signs have been orderedThe South Rim 4 Fire has had zero growth over the last six days. Cooler temperatures and higher humidity have reduced fire activity and slowed spread. There are still a few fingers of active burning and various hot spots within the perimeter of the fire. Smoke has been reported in the Townsend areas of the Chisos. Those areas will be watched. The fire is 80% contained. 
After burning for eleven days, the South Rim Fire has grown to 1341 acres and extended through much of the “sky island” of the high Chisos Mountains; however, the fire has not grown for four days. Aerial reconnaissance observed that the fire has left a patchy mosaic of scorched, burned, slightly singed, and untouched areas across the South Rim to Emory Peak, and into the lower Boot Canyon drainage. Several fingers of active burning continue. The cause of the South Rim 4 Fire remains unknown. Details of each operational period events:  Fire on the South Rim, as of 4/8/2021: The fire size upon initial size-up was 15 acres and located at the southern tip of the South Rim between Boot Canyon and Laguna Meadow. The head of the fire has met the edge of the rim and slowed. Yesterday, Texas Forest Service air attack has dropped retardant to keep the fire spread down while a crew of firefighters (the Diablos) were headed to the scene, and monitoring the situation through the evening. Trails and campsites in the high Chisos are closed to entry.   As of 1600 (4 p.m.), 4/9/21: The fire is backing toward the north and west. High winds are expected to continue into the evening. Our firefighters are working hard to contain the fire to the East and south of the Colima trail and south of the Boot cabin. Fire size is estimated at 300 acres.  On 4/9/2021: The South Rim Fire extended along the rim last night. Current on-site estimate is ~250 acres, primarily along the extreme southern edge of the South and East Rim. Additional retardant drops will occur today. Winds remain strong from the west/NW which is considered favorable. The firefighters are working hard in challenging conditions to keep the fire from spreading. On 4.10.21 crews worked on structure protection of Boot cabin and the corrals. A successful backburn in the Chisos was conducted for structure protection of Boot cabin.  By late Saturday, about 2/3 of the fire’s perimeter had stagnated after moving into rocky terrain and cliff edges. It is also slowly backing down Boot Canyon. On 4.11, crews worked on containment along the fire’s slowing edges in the High Chisos and setting up structural protection in the Basin developed area. Structural fire engines will be staged in the Basin area. By late Sunday, the Diablos Firefighters were able to cold-trail and contain the entire western flank of the fire, while the Mount Taylor Hotshots worked directly on advancing flames at the Emory Peak/Pinnacles saddle. With the help of carefully coordinated helicopter bucket drops of water, the crews were able to successfully secure that area. During the evening hours, fire climbed the eastern side and across the summit plateau of Toll Mountain. Flames and thick smoke were observed throughout much of the park.  On 4.12, Using 18 bucket drops they were able to get that under control and saved the Toll Mountain Campsite and composting toilet, trees, etc. in that area. On 4.13, cooler temperatures and higher humidity helped slow fire spread. The two hotshot crews will remain to monitor and take advantage of any opportunities to extend the containment. The structural crews have the Basin developed area prepped and protected.  On 4.14, another day of cooler temps and higher humidity has really helped keep fire activity down. Yesterday there was NO fire growth. Helicopter bucket drops were ""very effective"" in Boot and Juniper Canyon areas.  On 4.15, crews continued to work on securing the fire along the Toll Mountain ridgeline, keeping the developed area safe and defended, and conducting some prep work along the Lost Mine Saddle. The helicopter will be used for a detailed recon of the fire, and bucket drops along the east side as needed. Condition assessment of the various trails and backcountry campsites will also be happening today.   On 4.16, the hotshot crews will be monitoring, beginning to clear downed trees along trails, and directing bucket drops on the remaining hot spots. There are at least 38 trees down across the trails, with the majority in Boot Canyon. Diablos are working in the Basin area today, reducing fuels and ensuring that it is firesafe. The structural crew remains on duty to prep and protect Basin infrastructure. Resource staff are continuing their assessment and documentation of conditions along trails and around the backcountry campsites. On 4.17, the cool weather will continue to reduce fire activity. Crews will continue to monitor the fire, and direct bucket drops as necessary along the eastern edge. Effort are beginning to wind down. Some resources will begin to demobilize and depart Big Bend over the next few days. Assessment of the trails and campsites will continue.  On, 4.17, transition day for the fire from a Type 3 Incident Management Team (IMT) to a Type 4 (IMT) team. This indicates that the fire is decreasing in complexity and fire activity. The two Hotshot Crews will be demobilizing today. The Diablos Crew will stay on scene. The fire will continue to be monitored and bucket drops of water will be used as needed. Rehabilitation will also continue.    CLOSURE: The Chisos Basin will re-open at 11 a.m., on Friday, April 23rd.  Follow the park's twitter feed for the latest updates: https://twitter.com/BigBendNPS

Thunderbird Rx,"

Mountainair Ranger District Continues to Implement Thunderbird Prescribed Burn    Mountainair, NM – April 21, 2021 – If conditions remain favorable, fire managers on the Cibola National Forest & National Grasslands (NF & NGs) may continue implementation of the previously announced Thunderbird prescribed burn on the Mountainair Ranger District as early as , Friday, April 23nd and continue through Saturday, April 24th. The decision to proceed continues to depend on multiple factors, including resource availability, fuel moisture levels, air quality, ventilation, and forecasted weather and winds. The plan is to broadcast burn approximately 130 acres of the previously thinned Auroch and Ox1 units as well as 131 acres of the Green Acres unit. All three burns are within the Thunderbird Ecosystem Management Project. The Auroch Unit is at the southeast junction of FR422/275. The Ox1 unit runs along FR522, northeast of the 275/422 junction.  Green acres is north of FR 275 along the forest boundary and just west of Game Road. Fire managers consider smoke impacts to communities before making a final decision to implement a prescribed fire. Smoke from the Thunderbird Prescribed Burn may impact surrounding communities including Game Road residents, Mountainair, Punta de Agua, Manzano, the Estancia Valley or west Manzano communities such as Rio Communities, Belen or Los Lunas. 
With fire there is smoke, but compared to wildfires, prescribed fires are shorter in duration and are conducted under weather conditions to minimize the impact of smoke on the public. Fire crews use tactics such as starting early in the day and ending ignitions early in the afternoon to allow for the most ventilation possible throughout the burn and dividing blocks into smaller units to minimize smoke impacts as much as possible. However, smoke may be visible periodically from local communities and the surrounding areas for the duration of the project until the burning vegetation is out. Information on air quality and protecting your health can be found online at the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) website. Our land management strategy is centered on long-term forest health and that strategy includes reducing forest fuels and using prescribed fire on the landscape. A healthy forest is a resilient forest that undergoes fire occurrences on a regular basis. After this prescribed fire is completed, if a future wildfire reaches this area, the fire behavior will likely be modified to a less intense, more manageable surface fire due to the absence of accumulated debris and ladder fuels.   The Forest Service mission is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation’s forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. All fire updates will be posted on the Cibola NF & NGs website, New Mexico Fire Information website and on the Cibola Facebook  & Twitter pages.       For more information on the Thunderbird prescribed burn, contact the Mountainair Ranger District Office at 505.847.2990 or Cibola National Forest and National Grasslands Supervisor’s Office: 505.346.3900

Boise NF - 2021 Spring Prescribed Fire,"

Southwest Idaho spring prescribed fire burning planned 
Boise, Idaho, March 30, 2021— Southwest Idaho interagency fire managers anticipate favorable spring weather conditions for planned low-intensity prescribed fires. Prescribed fires are designed to reduce hazardous vegetation (fuels), large wildfire potential to communities, and improve wildlife habitat. Weather and conditions permitting, prescribed burns are scheduled to start in March and continue through June. Approximately 3,600 acres are planned for ignition in 11 project areas within the Boise National Forest. Public and firefighter safety is always the top priority in all public land fire operations. Fire managers develop burn plans that account for safety, specific fuel and weather prescriptions and smoke management. All prescribed burns are closely evaluated and are only approved when favorable conditions are present.  Prescribed burns may affect people sensitive to smoke and may impact access to burn areas and travel routes. Fire officials strongly advise forest visitors and homeowners to prepare and plan activities around the proposed dates and locations of burns and to use extreme caution near prescribed fire areas. Please be aware of firefighters and equipment in the area and on roadways, comply with posted notices and drive slowly in areas with decreased visibility.  Information and signs will be posted on roads that access burn areas in advance of ignitions and remain in place through burn completion.  Visit the interactive map with the latest planned areas of prescribed fire treatments. https://usfs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=3fbf12463b7c442e854010e203800d48  Zoom into your areas of interest to get the latest information.

Fall 2021 - Prescribed Fire Operations Update:After carefully monitoring conditions across the Forest, fire officials have determined that conditions are within specific parameters, including temperature, relative humidity, and fuel moisture to start prescribed fire operations in specifically planned units. Visit the 'News' section on this page for additional information on planned units and active operations.
Fuels have lost moisture over the long, hot summer. Burning under dry fuels conditions allows the fuels to potentially consume more completely and produce less smoke.Frequent, low-intensity fire is essential for healthy forests and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire caused by excessive fuel buildup. Prescribed burning is an effective tool for removing excessive amounts of brush, shrubs, and trees, while also encouraging the growth of native vegetation. It is only conducted when factors such as resource availability, air quality, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and fuel moisture levels are ideal. All burns are done under carefully planned prescriptions and protocols to eliminate the risk of an escaped fire and smoke exposure to communities. Since prescribed burn operations are planned in advance, they have critical safety components in place and are carefully designed to occur within a combination of natural and constructed control lines.  The Forest Service recognizes that hunting season coincides with prescribed burning season and can impact hunters, but controlled burns are necessary to reintroduce fire to the landscape and encourage healthy vegetation that will ultimately improve landscapes and forage for big game. Hunters should be cautious when entering a recently burned area and be aware of increased hazards, particularly snags. Dead or dying trees that remain standing after a fire are unstable, especially in high winds. Don’t camp or hang out in the burned area. And, as always, let someone know your planned route, destination and expected return time.  With the potential for smoke to settle in certain areas during active operations, the public can monitor the smoke and air quality in our area and across the state by visiting, http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/.
Additional information regarding prescribed burning on the Malheur National Forest is available by viewing the Prescribed Fire Activity interactive map, by visiting www.fs.usda.gov/malheur or by calling the Supervisor’s Office at 541-575-3000.For all of the latest Forest news on the Malheur National Forest, follow U.S. Forest Service-Malheur National Forest on Facebook and @MalheurNF on Twitter. 
For the safety of firefighters and the public, roads and areas of prescribed fire activity will be signed. Please avoid these areas so as not to interfere with ongoing operations. For safety, roads, trails and areas may need to close temporarily as firefighter operations are taking place. Smoky conditions may also reduce visibility to a level that would require additional temporary closures. During prescribed fire operations, there is potential for impacts to camping and hunting. Hunters are advised to plan ahead. For their safety, they should not camp in or near an area of prescribed fire activity.

Three Rivers Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Three Rivers Fire was detected about one half mile from the Three Rivers Campground in the Lincoln National Forest at 8:42am on April 26, 2021. It was initially sized at 30 acres, but grew to 6100 acres by 7:00am on April 27, 2021 due to high winds and other favorable climate conditions for increased fire behavior. Local firefighters from the surrounding communities including Ruidoso Fire Department, Nogal Volunteer Fire Department, Lincoln Volunteer Fire Department, Glencoe Volunteer Fire Department, Capitan Volunteer Fire Department, among others worked closely with the USDA Forest Service on initial attack. Approximately 250 community members were impacted by evacuations in the surrounding areas. However, precipitation in the form of both rain and snow began falling on the fire during the night of April 26th and continued on and off through the week, greatly reducing fire behavior. The fire entered the fire scar of the Little Bear Fire that burned in 2012, which also decreased fire activity as the vegetation was low to the ground and most was considered to be a fine fuel type (burns quickly, but not at a high temperature).At 1:00pm on April 27, 2021, evacuees were allowed to return to their homes. The incident transferred command to a Type 1 Incident Command team from the USDA Forest Service at 6:00am on April 28, 2021. Weather continued to be favorable for fire suppression. Rain and snow as well as mild temperatures for numerous days resulted in mild fire activity. Winds picked back up on Sunday, May 2, 2021, however fire lines continued to hold and there was minimal perimeter growth. After numerous days with no fire growth and minimal fire activity, the fire was transferred to a Type-3 Incident Management Team on May 4, followed by transfer of command to a Type 4 Incident organization on May 9, 2021.

The weather conditions were within prescription for fuel moisture, low wind speed, wind direction, and humidity levels in the 30-40% range and helped to produce an effective timber site prep burn for ecosystem management and fuels reduction. When fire managers reviewed the weather forecast for May 6, 2021 it was obvious that conditions would be out of prescription for prescribed fire with higher wind speeds and lower humidity levels. No prescribed fire activity was conducted on May 6, 2021 when critical fire weather and red flag warnings were issued. Crews continue to monitor Unit 5 and ensure that the prescribed fire remains within its boundaries.The units were recently harvested to prepare for future planting by reducing the slash and competing vegetation. These actions also support natural regeneration of long-lived conifer species, which in turn will diversify the species of trees in the area. All the Kangas units are a part of the greater Ely area hazardous fuel reduction effort. Prescribed fire treatments reduce hazardous fuels and create a patchwork or mosaic of fire-resistant forest stands in the landscape that can reduce the intensity of future wildfires.

Crews are implementing the Cordovas Unit 1 and Unit 3 prescribed burns on the Coyote Ranger District today after a successful test ignition.  If they don't complete the 260-acre burn today, they will continue tomorrow. Prescribed fires are always managed with firefighter and public safety as the first priority. The Cordovas project is designed to protect communities by reducing the accumulation of hazardous fuels and decreasing the potential for future severe wildfire. Prescribed fire mimics a natural fire regime by using low-intensity fire to recycle nutrients, improve wildlife habitat and promote forest health in a fire-adapted ecosystem.  Smoke management is a key part of the planning and implementation of prescribed burns. The SFNF manages prescribed fires in compliance with New Mexico state regulations on air quality and smoke management. Smoke from the Cordovas  prescribed burn may be visible from Gallina, Coyote, Mesa de Poleo, Youngsville and State Highway 96.

Exact dates and times can change dependent on weather and fuel conditions. The prescribed fire is expected to last two to four days with smoke present for several days. Firefighters plan to use handheld ignitions.
The El Calderon Road (NPS 100 Road) will be closed to non-resident traffic during the ignition phase. Additionally the Continental Divide Trail (which is the southern boundary of the burn unit) will be closed for the days where active ignition is taking place. If conditions warrant, a pilot car may be used along Hwy 53. Please slow down, turn your headlights on, and watch for firefighters working along the Hwy when traveling in this area.
The primary objective of this prescribed fire is to improve forest health by reducing the build-up of vegetation that can fuel a wildfire. Fire plays a natural role at El Malpais and helps ensure the resiliency of this fire dependent ecosystem.

Since lightning sparked the Cuervito Fire on Mother’s Day, crews have successfully managed the naturally ignited wildfire to achieve significant resource benefits, reducing the buildup of hazardous fuels and the risk of high-severity fire in the future. Location:  9 miles east of Pecos and 3 miles southwest of the Barillas Lookout on the Pecos/Las Vegas Ranger District 
Start Date:  May 9, 2021 Size:  Approximately 1,300 acres  Cause:  Lightning Resources Assigned:  37 personnel on scene, including 1 hand crew and 3 engines Fuels:  Ponderosa pine, piñon-juniper, Douglas fir and oak brush Operations:  The area in proximity to the fire received up to half an inch of precipitation recently, effectively ending ignitions on the Cuervito Fire. Today crews focused on reinforcing the southern perimeter and securing all edges. 
Weather:  Possible showers and thunderstorms this evening will shift to warmer, drier conditions on Thursday. Prospects for more precipitation increase again on Friday. There is a 60% chance of precipitation tonight with winds out of the southeast at 10 to 15 mph.  Values at risk:  Firefighter and public safety is always the number-one priority for the IMT. Values at risk include private property nearby. Smoke:  Smoke management is a key part of the planning and implementation of managed wildfire. Smoke from the Cuervito Firemay impact the communities of Santa Fe, Pecos, Las Vegas, Rowe, Glorieta, La Cueva, North and South San Ysidro, Ilfeld, San Jose, San Juan, Tecolote, Soham, Ribera, Serafina, Bernal, Anton Chico, Mineral Hill, San Geronimo and Pablo as well as the I-25 corridor and the Pecos National Historical Park. Safety:  Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures. Information on air quality and protecting your health can be found online at the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) website.

Three Rivers Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Three Phases of Wildfire Recovery
Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.
Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds; and protect critical cultural resources.
Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

Four Mile,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]  Payette National Forest Declares a Part of the Four Mile Prescribed Fire as a Wildfire
On May 6th the Payette National Forest applied prescribed fire to approximately 700 acres in the southern portion of the Four Mile project area along the South Fork of the Salmon River. This burn is approximately 5 miles south of Reed Ranch Airstrip and 14 miles southwest of Yellowpine.   On May 17th, a small portion of the prescribed fire (1/4 acre) spread beyond the project area boundary. Fire personnel have been unable to extinguish this portion of the prescribed fire due to burning snags in the area. Other portions of the burn unit also exhibited smoldering/creeping fire that may require actions to contain the potential for the prescribed fire to spread.   Due to the steep terrain, limited access, dry fuel conditions and time of year, we chose to declare this prescribed fire a wildfire on May 18.   ""This is not a wildfire typical of August and September wildfires on the Forest,"" said David Hogen, Krassel District Ranger. ""This wildfire is smoldering and creeping, with occasional torching of Lodgepole pine. As the fire moved out of the prescribed fire boundary, our protocol is to declare it a wildfire and manage it as a suppression fire.""   The fire is entirely on National Forest land and is not threatening private property or infrastructure. No area or road closures are in effect for this fire.  Forest visitors may encounter smoke in the vicinity of the wildfire.  Information on the Four Mile Fire is posted to Inciweb at:    Rain is forecasted for over the next 7 days but smoldering in the heavier concentrations of down logs is expected to continue after the rain event.  All actions to contain fire spread are based on risk to fire personnel, the public, and natural resources. Fire personnel will continue to take action where they can do so effectively and safely.  Fire updates will be posted regularly.  The Four Mile Prescribed Fire is a wildlife and natural resource prescribed fire to enhance wildlife habitat and assist in restoration of the forested ecosystem.

The Dog Fire was started by lightning on May 11, 2021. This is a full suppression fire. It is located in a remote and steep section of wilderness area in the park where access and terrain are challenging to firefighters working on the ground. Because of this, firefighters are utilizing natural and man-made barriers to maintain the fire within the park's upper elevations. As of June 2  the fire is 1,959 acres in size and is 40% contained. On May 31 the fire was placed in a patrol and monitor status due to minimal fire activity and minimal chance of continued fire growth. On June 2, little or no sources of smoke were observed. The majority of resources demobilized on June 3. A Type 6 Engine with a Type 4 Incident Commander remained assigned to the fire.
There is an area closure and fire restrictions in effect in the park. The area closure was revised effective June 1.

Yosemite Valley Prescribed Burn,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Following a successful test fire on the morning of May 24 and determination by Yosemite National Park Fire Management, fire crews are continuing with ignitions on the 439-acre Yosemite Valley Prescribed Burn. The project will focus on seven units east of El Capitan Crossover toward Leidig Meadow. Ignitions could last three days with smoke lingering in Yosemite Valley for one to two weeks. Smoke impacts will be localized to Yosemite Valley during the day with smoke likely drifting down canyon during the evening hours. This project is part of the Yosemite Valley Parkwide Prescribed Fire Plan which encompasses 35 units totaling 12,114 acres. Deputy Fire Management Officer Kelly Singer stated, “conducting fuels treatment in this area will reduce heavy accumulation of dead and down fuels. We anticipate temporary trail closures on the Valley Loop trail during burning operations. Visitors around Cathedral Beach, Sentinel Beach Picnic Area, and the 4-mile Trailhead starting from the Valley floor should expect to see fire personnel in the area.” There will be traffic control with one lane temporary closures in place.   Fire managers work closely with air quality specialists and local air pollution control districts to time projects to coincide with favorable weather and smoke dispersion conditions. Smoke impacts are always a consideration in the decision to begin prescribed burning ignitions. For air quality information, please visit: Yosemite Air Quality Page or airnow.gov   Over 50 years of research has shown park managers that total suppression of all fires does not prevent large severe wildfires. Park managers understand fires are inevitable in our fire-adapted ecosystem and working with fire is a pro-active way to protect our resources. Prescribed fire is an important technique used to reduce excessive vegetation build up on the landscape and reduce the potential for more severe fires. Updates:May 24, 2021:  Today on the Yosemite Valley Prescribed Burn, fire crews were able to complete 87 acres. With traffic control in Yosemite Valley for the next few days, firefighters want to remind visitors to please slow down as traffic patterns may change throughout the day. Ignitions will continue for the next couple of days as we work to ensure a healthy and sustainable forest. Pictures added to the Photographs tab.   May 25:  Fire crews have completed 115 acres of prescribed burning on the Yosemite Valley project. We focused on the area east of El Capitan Cross this evening. Tomorrow we are planning on active burning on the northern portion of the unit. Traffic control will remain in place, please slow down for firefighters working in the area. May 26: Ignitions were complete today on the prescribed burn. In total, 182 acres were treated. The reason ignitions were not done through the whole prescribed burn area, is that conditions changed and fire managers wanted to ensure objectives were being met by not rushing through this project.

Resources:  2 hand crews and 1 Type 3 helicopter Fuels:  Ponderosa pine and mixed conifer  Operations:  Operations today are following a familiar pattern as crews continue with mop-up and suppression repair. Firefighters are also monitoring fire behavior, which is still creeping and smoldering through vegetation on the ground.  Weather: Much of the state is under a fire weather watch with increasing winds, single-digit humidities and above-normal temperatures expected Thursday. Friday will be dry and hot. Moisture from Colorado is forecast to drop south into New Mexico with the potential for welcome precipitation.  Objectives: The health and safety of firefighters and the public are always the first priority. Other objectives  on the Wolf Draw Fire include limiting fire impacts on cultural resources, oil and gas infrastructure, private property, canyon ecosystems and Mexican spotted owl habitat. Smoke:  The Wolf Draw Fire is having minimal smoke impacts on surrounding areas. The smoke that is spreading across New Mexico is coming primarily from wildfires in Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures.

Ignitions will continue each day through June 9, 2021  While conducting prescribed burns, fire managers constantly take weather readings and monitor fire behavior to ensure that projects like this are not only being safely done but also meeting objectives. Crews are prepared to stop ignitions should conditions become unsuitable for burning, and resume when conditions return to an appropriate range. Ignitions on this prescribed burn are occurring early in the morning to take advantage of the cooler temperatures. The 2021 Ash Mountain Prescribed Burn consists of 12 segments, for a total of approximately 40 acres between the Sequoia National Park entrance station and the Foothills Visitor Center, one mile inside the park. Information about this prescribed burn will be post to the parks’ website, social media pages, and Inciweb at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7505 Visitors may see smoke, active fire, and firefighters during the burn, and are asked to drive slowly and follow all firefighter instructions. Smoke impacts are expected to be minimal and short-lived, as the vegetation in the unit is chiefly fine fuels that will be consumed quickly. Visitors can learn more about air quality and smoke by visiting www.airnow.gov or www.valleyair.org. Updates:June 6: 9 acres completed. No trail closures remain. All areas open.

Joseph Canyon Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Joseph Canyon Fire was one of multiple ignitions resulting from an overnight lightning storm June 3-4. It was reported Friday morning, June 4, by Washington Department of Natural Resources as burning in steep, rugged terrain in northern Wallowa County. Located 23 miles southwest of Lewiston, ID, the blaze began on Vale Bureau of Land Management lands, but soon crossed over into Washington state lands protected by Oregon Department of Forestry.  Three large airtankers dropped retardant along the perimeter of the Joseph Canyon Fire Friday to slow the fire growth.  In addition to firefighter delivery, three Type 2 helicopters were used to drop water on hot spots. The fire continued to burn actively overnight in the flashy fuels and was estimated to be approximately 2,500 acres by Friday afternoon. Cooler temperatures, reduced wind and moister air slowed the fire on Sunday and Monday, while crews made significant progress in containment. The fire is currently estimated at 7610 acres with 95% containment. Control of the fire was returned to the local unit on June 11 and will be patrolled and monitored using air resources.

The Robinson Fire located 20 miles south of Buffalo Wyoming, was started by lightning on Tuesday, June 8, 2021. Local Type 3 wildland fire units managed the fire during initial attack. Their skilled and assertive response slowed the fire’s growth despite gale force winds that grounded aircraft and threatened firefighters.
On Saturday, June 5, 2021 at 1900, the local Type 3 organization transferred command to the Rocky Mountain Area Blue Team (Type 2). With the use of aviation and Type 1 handcrews, firefighters successfully conducted a strategic burning operation. The burn operation secured the one section of the fire that was inaccessible due to the steepness of the terrain. This section of the fire will continue to be monitored however, the containment will not show on this section. Therefore containment will remain at 64%.The Rocky Mountain Area Type 2 Blue Team transitioned with a Type 4 organization on Friday, June 18, 2021.    “While we know that the community would like to provide even further support through the donation of goods, at this time due to continued COVID precautions, donated goods cannot be accepted for our responders.

Firefighters continue monitoring the fire, looking for hotspots along the perimeter, addressing hazards, and completing rehabilitation work. Firefighters are working most heavily in Geyser Pass and north of Haystack Mountain. Due to decreased resource needs and incident complexity, the Type 3 Incident Management Team is transitioning to the Type 4 Incident Management Team led by Kathryn Sebes from the Fish and Wildlife Service. This will be the final update unless conditions change.
Please respect private property and the privacy of area residents. Refrain from stopping in the Pack Creek Community. The residents of Pack Creek continue to recover from the impacts of the fire.
The fire managers would like to express their thanks to the community for all of their support. The team would also like to thank the responding fire departments including the Blanding Volunteer Fire Department, Green River Fire Department, La Sal Volunteer Fire Department, Moab Valley Volunteer Fire Department, Monticello Volunteer Fire Department, and Thompson Springs Volunteer Fire Department as well as our local partners including Grand and San Juan County Sheriffs and their departments, Grand County EMS, Rocky Mountain Power, local government entities, Grand County Water and Sewer, and others from around the state who supported firefighting efforts. Your contributions were invaluable.
Conditions:
While fire activity is minimal, the fire continues to burn in the interior and, as conditions dry out, Moab residents and visitors may continue to see smoke throughout the summer. Spot fires will likely cause isolated smoke columns and continue to burn in the areas closed to public access. These small fires have a low likelihood of spreading and will help clean out light fuels from the forest understory.
Evacuations Lifted:
As of today Tuesday, July 6, 2021, all remaining private property evacuation orders associated with the Pack Creek Fire have been lifted by the San Juan County Sheriff. This includes private property in and around the area east of Geyser Pass on La Sal Mountains, from Blue Lake down through Dark Canyon Area. However Geyser pass road from Trans La Sal Trailhead on the west side of the closure and to the upper geyser pass trailhead (Whole Enchilada) on the east side of the closure will be closed. All of the Oowah Lake road will remain gated, locked and closed. Oowah campground will be closed.
Forest Closure: 
The forest closure for parts of the western slope of the La Sal Mountains is still in effect. We appreciate the continued support from the public and ask that you continue to stay out of the area for firefighter and public safety. The Manti-La Sal National Forest is planning to update the closure for National Forest lands to allow for increased access. When available, the updated forest information will be posted on the Manti-La Sal Forest website at: www.fs.usda.gov/mantilasal. 
Soil Burn Severity Map: 
Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team finalized the Soil Burn Severity map for the Pack Creek Fire. The soil burn severity is categorized by 4 levels: unburned, low, moderate, and high. BAER soil scientists used satellite images to prioritize places in the field to assess soil burn severity. The team sampled sites to evaluate soil changes caused by the fire. They collected information on ground cover, canopy consumption, intact roots, and water repellency to better understand soil burn severity. The analysis showed soil burn severity (noted in acres):
Unburned: 820 acres (9%)Low: 3,722 (40%)Moderate: 4,586 (49%) High: 151 (2%)
BAER post-fire assessment teams use the soil burn severity data to identify risks to human life and safety, property, and critical natural and cultural resources from increased soil erosion, accelerated surface water run-off, and debris flows. This information helps the BAER team determine areas where potential emergency stabilization treatments may be needed to reduce risk.
The team prepared the attached Soil Burn Severity map. The Soil Burn Severity map isn’t an erosion risk map, but does help define areas where potential increases in the rates of erosion and run-off are expected from steep hillslopes with high and moderate soil burn severity. Areas located downstream from moderate and high soil burn severity may experience increased rates of erosion, debris flows, and surface run-off following short-duration, high-intensity rainfall events.
Other Information:
The Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) over the fire area has been lifted and normal flight operations in the area can resume. 
Investigators are still seeking leads to help identify those responsible for the fire’s ignition. Anyone who has information related to the identification of the responsible party of the Pack Creek Fire can call the tip line at 775-355-5337.

Robertson Draw,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]THIS FIRE IS NO LONGER BEING UPDATED The Robertson Draw Fire started at approximately 2:17 P.M. on Sunday June 13th. Local fire departments and engines from the Custer Gallatin National Forest responded. By June 15th severe fire weather and behavior resulted in significant fire growth, as it grew from 2,000 acres to over 21,000.  Cooler weather occurred on subsequent days, including a 1/4"" rain on Sunday June 20th, which helped to moderate fire behavior. The fire has also received an inch of rain between 8/15 and 8/21, which has helped to greatly moderate fire behavior.  The fire area is in the midst of a warm/dry trend, and firefighters are remaining vigilant for changes in fire behavior and new fire starts due to the threat of thunderstorms and associated potential for strong, outflow winds. Incident Command and cooperating agencies have discussed the long-term management of the Robertson Draw Fire. The area of concern is a portion of the fire burning on the northwest side of Mt. Maurice that is in difficult terrain and, in some areas, it is unsafe for firefighters to construct containment line and mop up hot spots. Firefighters completed containment line in the area on Mt. Maurice that they can safely access. Strategies are being implemented that reduce firefighter risk and have a high probability of success in protecting private property as well as keeping the fire confined to its current footprint. Existing hand and dozer line will be used in concert with a network of pumps and hose to protect private property and other tactics, including aerial resources, will be used to hold this fire. Transparency is necessary with the public to convey that there is a possibility of the fire not only picking up in activity, but also spreading past the current fire perimeter if certain variables such as fuel dryness and elevated fire weather were to line up to support fire spread. All measures are being taken to avoid this possibility, but a small portion of the fire perimeter is not able to be contained and the warm, dry trend will likely continue for much of the summer. Because of the inability to mitigate the risk to firefighters on the northwest face of Mt. Maurice, the area will be living with fire until a season-ending rain or snow event takes place.  Smoke may be seen on hot, dry days. Response will be strategic based on fire behavior, available resources, current and expected weather conditions, location of the activity, and the hazards within that location.

The Dairy Fire, located south of Red Bluff adjacent to the Sacramento River, started on June 15, 2021 and is now 100% contained. The fire burned approximately 163 acres of the La Barranca and Mooney units of the Sacramento River National Wildlife Refuge, primarily through remnant riparian forests and a small piece of habitat that had recently been restored. Firefighters from the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex, U.S. Forest Service, and CalFire  worked through the night and held the fire at 165 acres. Firefighters from the refuge and USFS continued to work in hot and dry conditions securing the perimeter and extinguishing hot spots, preventing the fire from crossing the containment lines during the high heat and north winds. Wildfire in these remnant forests is rare, the current hot and dry conditions in a typically wet habitat underscores the importance of fire safety in and around these dry forest habitats.

Telegraph Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY
There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands: 
-       Fire Suppression Repair 
-       Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) 
-       Long-Term Recovery and Restoration 
o   Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts. 
o   Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on federallands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources.
o   Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

The Inyo National Forest extends 165 miles near the California and Nevada border. It covers about two million acres, mostly on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada.
Approximately one million acres are in nine Congressionally-designated Wilderness Areas. Elevations range from 4,000’ in the Owens Valley to 14,494’ at Mt. Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous United States.
Like all national forests, the Inyo is managed for ecosystem health and multiple uses, as directed by Congress. Although most visitors think of the forest for its recreation, the Inyo National Forest is also used for range, timber, minerals, watershed, and habitat for fish and wildlife.

The Wild Cow Fire was reported on June 21. The fire is in Garfield County, on BLM land, about 33 miles north of Mack, CO. The Wild Cow Fire is being managed by the Upper Colorado River Type 3 Team.
Many of the crews have been reassigned to other fires burning in the area that need resources, though an engine and crew, a fuels module, and a Type 2 helicopter will stay with this fire.
“This was definitely a team effort, “ said Incident Commander Ross Wilmore. “When we began managing this fire, it was a challenging fire due to the terrain and the weather conditions. We received a lot of support from regional fire managers, which allowed us to catch the fire and keep it from growing any larger.”
The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but lightning is suspected. The Upper Colorado River Type 3 Incident Management Team (IMT) is returning the management of the fire to local fire management staff on Wednesday, June 30.
There are no road closures or evacuations for this fire.

 YREKA, Calif, July, 10, 2021- As of 6 A.M. July 10th, the Tennant Fire has burned 10,580 acres and is 95% contained. The Tennant Fire continues to show minimal fire activity, primarily burning within the 2009 Tennant Fire footprint. Firefighting resources have been assigned to isolate the areas of heat remaining and extinguish them. Due to the current heatwave and critically dry fuels, fire managers are anticipating some flare-ups within the interior of the fire, but they should not pose a threat to the control line. This morning, July 10th, 2021, the Type 2 CA Incident Management Team 15 transferred command of the Tennant Fire back to the Klamath National Forest Type 3 Incident Management Team due to the increase in the containment of the fire. An area of high pressure has produced another heat wave this weekend with near triple-digit temperatures possible. A very dry and unstable air mass has settled over the incident with single digit humidities. Poor overnight humidity recoveries are expected. After morning terrain driven flows, afternoon westerly breezes will materialize and persist through the early evening. Area closures remain in effect for National Forest lands surrounding the Tennant Fire. The cause of the Tennant Fire is under investigation.

Wrentham Market,"

The Wrentham Market Fire began on 06/29 east of Dufur in Wasco County, burning on unprotected lands in the Columbia Rural Fire Protection District. Originally reported as a 40 acre fire, it rapidly grew with dry, windy conditions. Local fire crews worked with farmers and ranchers to cut lines and direct fire attack. Their efforts played a major role in saving structures and curtailing significant fire spread. The Oregon State Fire Marshal (OSFM) Red Incident Management Team took command on 06/30 and was soon joined by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Unified command between OSFM and BLM was established as federal recreational land was threatened by further spread of the fire. 
Operations continued on Friday with mop-up and monitoring by both the BLM and OSFM Lane County Task Force. The fire remains at an estimated 7,222 acres and is 91% contained. 
BLM hand crews completed mop-up of hotspots, eliminating hazard trees, and strengthening fire lines. They will be transitioning out today as priorities across the state focus on the fire potential for the holiday weekend.
Firefighters continued to monitor the area today, but with several days of no significant activity and the hard work done by crews, control and oversight of the area will be returned to local authorities. Evacuation levels are expected to change. Visit the Wasco County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page for the most up-to-date information regarding these changes. Local residents can also sign up to receive future emergency notifications through the county.

Backbone Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY 
There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:  -       Fire Suppression Repair  -       Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)  -       Long-Term Recovery and Restoration  o   Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.  o   Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.  o   Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

Batterman RD,"

The Batterman Road Fire started on July 4, 2021 at approximately 12:15 PM along the north side of Batterman Road in East Wenatchee.  Resources from Douglas County and various local fire departments were called out for the initial response. Within the first few hours the fire spread quickly in grass and additional firefighters were called from the Department of Natural Resources, Bureau of Land Management, and the US Forest Service.  Due to the extreme terrain with steep drainages and cliffs, firefighters on the ground had trouble getting direct access to parts of the fire.  Numerous aircraft, including air tankers dropping retardant and several helicopters providing water drops, worked to extinguish the fire in the inaccessible terrain.   The evening of July 4 brought shifting winds that pushed the fire toward Rock Island Grade and down drainage.  A Type 3 Interagency Incident Management Team was called in to provide additional support. The fire moved across multiple jurisdictions including privately owned land.  At that time, priorities were structure protection as well as public and firefighter safety.  Douglas County Sheriff's Office promptly issued many evacuation notices to residents living in the Batterman Road and Rock Island Grade areas.   The fire continued to grow and aviation resources were heavily relied upon.  Additional resources on the ground were also needed.  Due to the increased number of personnel and overall complexity of the situation, a Type 2 Interagency Incident Management Team assumed command on July 6, 2021 at 6AM. 
Resources have made continue progress toward containing the fire by constructing hand line and dozer line and lighting small controlled fires along the lines to reinforce the perimeter and stop the advancing fire by removing unburned fuel.  Aircraft has been relied upon throughout the duration of the incident for retardant and water drops to cool hot spots and quell flaming fronts. Mop-up operations have been carried out and continue to be in progress in many areas of the fire.  The cause remains unknown and under investigation by local authorities.Local Type 4 Incident Commander will transition into command on July 10, 2021.  No further Inciweb updates will be provided by this team.

Jack Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Jack Fire located on the Umpqua National Forest started on July 5, 2021 at approximately 5:00 p.m. It is a human-caused fire. Warm dry weather, fuel types and steep terrain contributed to rapid fire growth. Initial attack efforts included the U.S. Forest Service, Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) and Douglas Forest Protection Association (DFPA). Highway 138 was initially closed between Steamboat and Dry Creek Store. 
By July 8th, the Fire grew to 4,224 acres with 0% containment. The Fire was in Unified Command with Northwest Incident Management Team 9 (NWIMT-9) and the State of Oregon Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) Blue Incident Management Team (IMT). Within three days, the Jack Fire was at 10,937 acres. Steep terrain, warm temperatures and low relative humidity aided in fire growth.  
On July 13th the Fire had somewhat stabilized. OSFM Blue IMT demobilized, and management of the Jack Fire was transferred back to DFPA. Structure protection was monitored by DFPA and NWIMT-9. The fire continued to grow, reaching 16,667 acres and 25% containment on July 16th. Evacuation levels were reduced, and Highway 138 was re-opened to the public. On July 19th, 50% containment was achieved and the fire was estimated to be 17,994 acres. 
On July 30th the fire was at 23,004 acres with 63% containment. Multiple storm cells passed over the area through the night and ignited approximately 22 new fires. The Rough Patch Complex was established about 10 miles north of the Jack Fire to help manage the bulk of the new starts. Initial attack crews from the Jack Fire and Umpqua National Forest worked to suppress them. August 2nd, additional storm cells passed over the area and ignited 15 new fires. Four of the new starts were successfully contained by initial attack, and the rest of the new fires were assigned to the Rough Patch Complex. 
Higher humidity and lower temperatures limited August 5th fire growth to less than 100 acres and the Jack Fire reached 23,280 acres with 54% containment. For the next 10 days a high-pressure system hovered over the fire area creating a sustained inversion. This resulted in moderate fire activity and growth. Firefighters were able to hold the fire inside containment lines on the west, northwest, and northeast sides of the fire. During this time, the Great Basin IMT Team 2 took command of both the Rough Patch Complex and the Jack Fire.
Northern Rockies IMT Team 1 assumed command of the Jack Fire on August 28. Great Basin Team 2 again assumed command of the Jack Fire on September 10. 
Northwest Team 7 assumed command of the Jack Fire on September 24. Multiple days of precipitation have reduced the fire behavior and suppression tactics shifted to suppression repair. On October 1, Rocky Mountain Area Type 2 Blue Team assumed command of the fire with the intent of reducing the footprint of the complex and continuing suppression repair efforts. 
The Jack Fire is being managed under a full suppression strategy. Public and firefighter safety is the number one priority. In addition, protection of communities, timber resources, private property, highway corridors and recreational improvements are key considerations. Closures & Additional InformationFire closures are in place on BLM lands, the Umpqua National Forest, and Willamette National Forest.

West Lolo Complex (Thorne Creek),"

This Thorne Creek Fire/West Lolo Complex InciWeb Page is not being regularly updated after August 29, 2021. It will be updated as closure information changes or if fire behavior and conditions warrant. 
NEW! (10/7/21)All closures associated with the Thorne Creek Fire (West Lolo Complex) have been lifted. Please exercise caution when traveling through a burned area as hazards exist. The Thorne Creek Fire is now 100% contained. Firefighters are continuing to patrol and monitor the fire when needed. Some interior smoldering/smoking may still be visible until a season ending event occurs, such as significant snowfall. Tips for traveling in or near a burned area:  •Those traveling on Forest roads through burned areas should be prepared to remove downed trees that may have fallen across the roads or trails.  •Snags – or dead, standing trees – are prone to fall without warning in burned areas. In windy conditions the danger of falling snags is heightened and visitors should always be alert to the condition of trees and the weather. •The base of a tree may be consumed in a wildfire and the stump completely burned out, leaving a deep pocket or hole not visible when walking through the area. Use Caution when walking near the burned-out base of a tree. 
Incident Background: Thunderstorms on July 7, 2021, started multiple wildfires across the Lolo National Forest. U.S. Forest service personnel in coordination with local cooperators and response partners actively engaged the fires. The western portion of the Forest, which includes the Superior and Plains-Thompson Falls Ranger Districts, experienced the most lightning activity.
The only fire currently remaining in the Complex is the Thorne Creek Fire. The Thorne Creek Fire is approximately 6 miles north-northeast of Thompson Falls, Montana. Fires that have been contained include Quinns, Upper Graves Creek, Thompson, Deep Creek, Sheep Creek, Cataract, Siegel and Sunset. The Winniemuck Fire joined the Thorne Creek Fire on July 17 and is now referred to as the Thorne Creek Fire. The Thorne Creek Fire is being managed under a full suppression strategy. Public and Firefighter safety is the number one priority. In addition, minimizing impacts to local communities, private property and structures, timber resources, highway corridors, and recreation improvements are key considerations.

This fire was reported at 3:16 p.m. on July 7, 2021 in Pine Creek Canyon west of Bishop. The fire has been mapped at 24.7 acres and the cause is under investigation.  Four Southern California Edison (SCE) power poles were damaged or destroyed in the fire. As a result there will be delays for motorists on Pine Creek Road as crews work to repair and replace the poles. Pine Creek Road gives public access to several wilderness trailheads in the area, including Pine Creek Pass, Italy Pass and Gable Lakes.  Fire Restrictions remain in effect for the Inyo National Forest and Bishop Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Campfires are allowed only in developed campgrounds and recreation sites.

The Middle Fire was one of several lightning-caused fires that occurred as a result of thunderstorms passing through the area. 
All of the lightning-caused fires received rain, but the Middle Fire continued to grow prompting fire officials to order a Type 2 Incident Management Team on July 7, 2021. The fire is burning 3 miles west of the Verde River and 3 miles northeast of Red Creek Ranch, in a remote area where access is extremely challenging due to steep, rocky terrain. Fire activity has steadily increased due to outflow winds from recent thunderstorms, higher temperatures, and lower humidity. The fire continues to grow to the north and northeast. 
Southwest Area Type 2 Incident Management Team 4, led by Incident Commander Carl Schwope, assumed command of the Middle Fire at 6:00 AM on Friday, July 9, 2021.

The Type 3 the Albuquerque Zone Incident Management Team (or IMT) assumed command of the Balsinger and Ellis Fires, which were under the name Divide Complex. The Type 2 Southern Area Gold Team followed, and they also incorporated management of the American Fork. The Type 1 Southern Area Red Team was next, and they incorporated management of the Woods Creek Fire. On August 12th, Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team 1 assumed command of the Balsinger, American Fork, and Woods Creek Fires, and under them management of the Ellis Fire was given back to the local ranger district. Following was the Albuquerque Zone Type 3 IMT for command of the American Fork Fire, and the FDNY Type 2 Incident Management Team for the Balsinger and Woods Creek Fires. Lastly, the Balsinger Fire is going back to management by the local Forest Service district, and a Type 3 IMT under the leadership of Martinez is assuming command of the Woods Creek Fire.
 At 77 % contained as of August 19th, the majority of the uncontained area of the Balsinger Fire is in steep inaccessible terrain. Likely the fire will not be deemed completely out until a season ending event occurs. Suppression repair work continues along the fire containment lines and contingency lines on both Forest and private land to prevent soil erosion.   Please respect the Balsinger Fire Area Closure; it is there for both firefighter and public safety. Despite recent moisture and very little visible smoke, pockets inside the fire area could continue to burn until a season-ending event. Please contact the Belt Creek-White Sulphur Springs Ranger District for alternative locations to hunt and recreate on the forest.   Starting September 1st, there will be no more fire updates.

Management was assumed by a Type 3 Incident Management Team (or IMT) from Nevada. The Type 1 Southern Area Red IMT was next, and they had command of the Woods Creek, Balsinger, Ellis and American Fork Fires. On August 12th, Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team 1 assumed command of the Balsinger, American Fork, and Woods Creek Fires. Following was the FDNY Type 2 Incident Management Team which managed the Balsinger and Woods Creek Fires. Lastly, the Balsinger Fire is going back to management by the local Forest Service district, and a Type 3 IMT under the leadership of Martinez is assuming command of the Woods Creek Fire.
 At 90 % contained as of August 31st, the majority of the uncontained area of the Woods Creek Fire is in steep inaccessible terrain. Likely the fire will not be deemed completely out until a season ending event occurs. Suppression repair work continues along the fire containment lines and contingency lines on both Forest and private land to prevent soil erosion.   Please respect the Woods Creek Fire Area Closure; it is there for both firefighter and public safety. Despite recent moisture and very little visible smoke, pockets inside the fire area could continue to burn until a season-ending event. Please contact the Townsend Ranger District for alternative locations to hunt and recreate on the forest.   Starting September 1st, there will be no more fire updates. Inciweb will be updated if a significant change in fire behavior or activity occurs.

The Burbank fire, located west of South Badger Pocket Road in Yakima County and east of I-82, is spreading in a south/southwest direction. Southeast WA Type 3 Incident Management Team has assumed command of the response to the Burbank fire and is working with the Yakima Training Center Emergency Operation Center.The fire started at approximately 4:30 p.m. by I-82 milepost 18 in the Burbank Creek area on Saturday, July 10th. Kittitas Valley Fire & Rescue (KVFR) firefighters were first on scene, followed shortly at 4:40 p.m. by the Yakima Training Center Fire Department (YTC FD), which was requested by Kittitas County for mutual aid. At 5:40 p.m., driven by high wind speeds, dry weather conditions, and quickly igniting sage and grass fuels, the fire spread eastward into the Yakima Training Center. Once the fire spread to the training center, it threatened several structures, which fire resources successfully protected. By 8:30 pm, the fire had expanded to approximately 5,000 acres and was moving through the canyon between Yakima and Umtanum Ridges. Firefighters from YTC FD, KVFR, Selah, Yakima and the BLM, along with WA DNR air assets and YTC dozer crews, worked diligently through the afternoon and night to protect structures and mitigate the spread of the fire.The cause is unknown and a fire investigator has been ordered to the fire. The fire started adjacent to I-82, not from within the training center. Due to a red flag warning (hot, dry, and windy weather conditions which mark a high potential for fire activity), no training was taking place in the Yakima Training Center when the fire ignited.

The Tamarack Fire on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest’s Carson Ranger District near Markleeville, California, has been declared 100 percent controlled. The fire reached this milestone after steady precipitation over the weekend provided much needed moisture to the fire area.
The fire was reported on July 4, 2021 and burned 68,637 acres. Approximately 82 percent of the Tamarack Fire had been contained since late August. The remaining 18 percent was in extremely rugged terrain and being actively managed for confinement using natural barriers until a season ending weather event occurred. Repair and rehabilitation work related to the Tamarack Fire will continue for quite a while.
 The Tamarack Fire Area Closure expires on Oct. 31, and though this will increase recreational opportunities, caution in the burned area is still advised. Posing no threat to containment, the public might still see smoke occasionally from large diameter trees and stump holes smoldering in the fire area. Other dangers include fire weakened hazard trees and loose rocks and debris on steep slopes. Sedimentation flows and increased runoff will pose a threat as well. It is important to note and heed signage warning of potential hazards.

Despite its isolated location, local response was quick with both aerial and ground resources. Over the remainder of July and through August, the fire continued to grow to over 6,000 acres in rough and often inaccessible terrain around Crater and Boyd Ridges.
This area of the Bighorn National Forest has a high volume of dispersed camping and hunters preparing for the fall season. Numerous travel trailers were located near the fire area. To allow for the safe exit of the public and ease access for the firefighters, the Forest implemented a closure in effect for much of the National Forest lands north of Highway 14A and east of the Big Horn/Sheridan County line. There are two large burn scars in the Crater Ridge Fire area - the 1970 Pumpkin Creek Fire to the west and the 2003 Little Horn II Fire to the east. As the fire started to burn northward, it laid down when it reached both burn scars and continued to burn to the north between them. While burning continues in these scars, spread is greatly reduced due to the lesser amount of available fuel. A fire history is provided on maps of this incident.

Image options: [ Full Size ] In order to reduce the risk of high-intensity wildfire, improve forest health and wildlife habitat, the Bureau of Land Management Tres Rios Field Office has planned a prescribed fire treatment for up to 717 acres on Animas City Mountain in Durango, Colorado. Dependent on weather and the availability of firefighters to conduct the operation, the prescribed burns could take place as early as the fall of 2021 or in the spring of 2022. An Environmental Assessment which covers this, as well as other treatment areas in La Plata County, has been completed and is available here: Final Environmental Assessment. Prescribed fires require a comprehensive plan consisting of 21 elements. The plan outlines the methodical process from inception to completion. The Animas City Mountain project is expected to take 2-3 days for ignitions, with additional time to patrol the area and extinguish hot spots. The mountain has been divided into seven units or compartments. Crews are expected to begin burning on the top of the mountain by slowly lighting an edge that has already been thinned with chainsaws. Once a secure edge or “black line” has been established, firefighters ignite the interior of each unit, one unit at a time. The fire then burns back toward the secured, black edge. This methodical approach allows firefighters opportunities to halt ignitions if burning conditions become undesirable. Examples of undesirable conditions are fire behavior that is too active/not active enough, and poor smoke dispersion. Firefighters will also have water on hand to cool things down if fire activity grows beyond a desirable level.   Prescribed fires are watched carefully by firefighters around the burn, lookouts at more distant locations, aerially (helicopters, planes, drones), and with calibrated smoke monitors. These monitors will be placed at locations around the burn to track smoke impacts in real time. The BLM and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Air Quality (CPDHE) have been working since 2018 to develop a permit that accomplishes the burn while minimizing smoke impacts to the surrounding area. Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, visit https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health. Prescribed fires are a tool to minimize smoke impacts to communities by careful selection of when fires burn and when they stop. Firefighters utilize compartments to halt the fire from spreading overnight, whereas wildfire continue to burn overnight when smoke is likely to settle into low lying areas where communities are located. Residual smoke from the interior areas of the compartments is anticipated, but the goal is to start early in the day and stop early in the evening to give material as much time as possible to be consumed before night-time cooling occurs and smoke sinks into the valley.    Ideal timing (windows) for the project occurs during the Spring and Fall when conditions are more favorable for low-intensity fire. Fuel (vegetation) and weather conditions must fall within a predetermined “prescription” that is known to yield desirable results while still being controllable by the fire personnel conducting the burn. Dissipation of smoke is also part of the prescription. Prescription development has been done by local fire experts who utilize fire behavior computer modeling software combined with decades of experience conducting prescribed burn in southwest Colorado.   This project is a coordinated effort between the federal/county/local government, NGOs, emergency managers, fire departments, public health officials, state smoke regulators and nearby residents. The burn is planned to take place over the course of 2-3 days. Brief closure of Animas City Mountain during the ignitions will occur for public and firefighter safety. The containment lines used for the project will consist of BLM designated trails. The units will be ignited using a combination of ground and aerial resources and will be patrolled/mopped up until out.   The project is part of the BLM’s ongoing commitment to protecting human health and safety while maintaining or enhancing forest and woodland health and functionality. The Animas City Mountain area was previously masticated in 2010 which altered the vertical structure of the forest stand to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire. Mastication is a treatment method where the understory is mowed and mulched with a large machine. The mulched material slowly decomposes, while the understory regrows. Mastication and prescribed fire are effective in preventing fires from leaving the ground and becoming “crown” fires where the entire trees or stand of trees burn. Treatments thin and remove some of the large dense understory or “ladder fuels”.   Vegetation, however, grows back and requires maintenance. Prescribed fire is the best treatment option for this forest type, if possible, after the initial mechanical treatment. While consuming some of the standing vegetation; prescribed fire also eliminates material left on the ground from both mastication and the natural shedding of leaves, needles, etc. Fire is the only natural process used as a treatment method and produces the most effective results for hazardous fuel reduction while enhancing woodland health. Ponderosa pine woodlands are a drought resistant species that have evolved with a natural cycle of frequent, low-intensity fire.   Prescribed fire mimics this natural process and improves forage for wildlife, as well as increasing plant diversity by creating breaks in the understory where grasses and flowers can thrive.   Every year the west is impacted by large catastrophic wildfires. Prescribed fires and other treatment methods lessen the impacts of future fires and increase the likelihood firefighters can work safely and be effective at stopping fires in and near treated areas.

Background:
The Dixie Fire started on July 13, 2021. The fire burned on the Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, Lassen Volcanic National Park, and across five counties: Butte, Lassen, Plumas, Shasta and Tehama. The Fly Fire started on July 22 and was managed under the Dixie Fire East Zone command as the two fires eventually merged into one. The drought, combined with hot weather, strong winds, and exceptionally dry vegetation, resulted in very active fire behavior.No further updates will be posted to the Dixie Fire Inciweb page.

Lava Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY 
 There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:  -       Fire Suppression Repair  -       Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)  -       Long-Term Recovery and Restoration  o   Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.  o   Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.  o   Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

Goat Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]This will be the final update for the Goat Fire unless significant activity occurs. Heavy equipment, ground and felling crews worked hard in steep, rugged terrain over the last few weeks to create safe access to and from the fire, construct contingency lines, and aggressively seek and eliminate heat sources near the fire’s edge. Repair work from suppression activities will continue into the near future. Recent weather and natural barriers have assisted firefighters in accelerating these efforts and minimizing fire behavior.  An infrared flight over the area on August 8th revealed no heat signatures and fire activity is minimal.  Small amounts of smoke may still be visible as interior islands of unburned vegetation continue to smolder.  The fire will be monitored just in case a low probability event occurs and it escapes control features.  Area closures have been lifted, allowing the public back into the interior of the Flint Creek Mountains.  If you have further questions related to the Goat Fire, please contact the Pintler Ranger District at 406-859-3211.

The Club Fire experienced growth to the east and northeast on September 6 and 7, 2021 adding about 1,400 acres to the total acreage. Subsequent days have continued to see growth to the east/northeast due to high winds and low relative humidity, however cloud and smoke cover on the morning of September 10 was limiting fire behavior. The fire is surrounded by burn scars from previous fires, though some older burned areas are not slowing growth. The fire has been burning actively through the 1988 Silver Fire, but managers are not seeing active spread through the 2007 Tag Fire area. Firefighters are in place at Cold Meadows Guard Station establishing point protection for the administrative site. As of September 9th, the fire was estimated to be around 2.5 miles to the southwest of Cold Meadows. This fire started 3 miles southwest of Root Ranch. Crews have completed point protection on values at risk to the admin site in close cooperation with Root Ranch personnel.

The Club, Rush Creek, and Vinegar fires were started by lightning on July 15, 2021.Regarding our response to wilderness wildfires, we respond to every wildfire with the safety of the public and our firefighters as our highest priority. The safety of the public, communities and all front-line responders will always remain our highest priority. Our response may have a wide range of actions including indirect engagement such as using direct and indirect confinement strategies and point protection.  With every new fire start, fire managers engage in a comprehensive risk analysis to identify the safest and most appropriate management actions - firefighters will not directly engage unless necessary and only when risk is mitigated to an acceptable level.
Wildfire decisions are inherently complex. These decisions are based on sound risk management and the best information available, to include fire behavior, fire danger conditions, mitigation of hazards, available resources, firefighter and public safety, and values that are threatened.

Forecast: Afternoon humidity will continue to fall down to below
10% in many areas with breezy west winds of 10 to 15 mph with
gusts to near 22-25 mph. Dense smoke and haze will likely linger
through the remainder of the day which will keep afternoon
temperatures from getting much over 102 degrees. Smoke columns
will likely persist through the afternoon, with a non-zero lightning risk. Gusty and erratic winds can be expected with column
collapses.
Tonight, dense smoke and haze will continue, especially in any of the valleys, sheltered areas and/or drainage basins.

Sunday has the potential to be hot, dry and breezy along with dense smoke across most of the Dixie Fire. The threat for smoke columns reaching pyro-cumulus status will increase with isolated lightning strikes becoming an increasing possibility.

 The Harris Mountain Fire started on July 23rd approximately 10 miles southeast of Cascade. The lightning caused fire grew quickly, burning over 3,000 acres within the first burn period. Northern Rockies Team 7, a Type II Incident Management Team, assumed command of the fire from the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) at 6:00 AM on July 26th and managed the fire through August 14th.
The fire is located in difficult and rugged terrain with fuels and topography driving fire activity. Location, along with limited resources creates challenges for immediate suppression. Multiple crews, engines, dozers, water tenders and air resources are assigned to the fire and providing point protection near structures.The Cascade County Sheriff's Office issued evacuation orders and notices for approximately 60 residences from July 25th to August 9th; currently all evacuation orders and notices are rescinded.  No evacuations have been issued for residents in Lewis and Clark County.

Aerial resources provided support cooling areas of intense heat as ground crew began mop up to secure the line and prevent spotting.  Due to the significant precipitation that occurred over the fire area last night and this morning, fire managers are reassessing the situation and deciding how best to move forward today, keeping firefighter safety and fire containment as a top priority. With more rain expected, flash flooding remains a concern in the burned area.  Boise National Forest fire managers/fuels specialists would like to remind visitors that despite the rain, the Forest is still very dry and remains in Stage 1 Fire Restrictions. Given these drought conditions, Forest officials ask the public to be extremely careful and Know Before You Go.  Public and firefighter safety concerns are the top priority. Motorists should use caution driving along the Arrowrock road (#268) corridor and expect to encounter fire traffic and delays as crews work to suppress the fire. There are currently no closures in effect. A strong upper level high pressure will continue with hot temperatures. Monsoon moisture will bring a chance of thunderstorms to southern and eastern areas on Saturday and Sunday. Cooler temperatures are expected Saturday through Monday. Flash flooding is possible with thunderstorms Saturday afternoon through Sunday night, primarily in higher elevations.  Visitors traveling to Atlanta, Idaho, are encouraged to use National Forest System (NFS) road 327 (Granite/Rabbit Creek) and reminded that NFS road 384 (Edna Creek) is closed for construction and impassable.

The park is working with the local air quality districts. Smoke will be visible near the fire locations and from high country vistas however, smoke from regional wildfires in the state of California may affect visibility over the area.
All trails in the area remain open.  However, please use caution and follow all posted trail signs. There are no current threats to the Public or Park infrastructure.

All fires on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest requiring a Burned Area Emergency Response assessment will also be posted in one central location at Central Washington Fire Recovery 2021 THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY
There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:
-       Fire Suppression Repair
-       Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)
-       Long-Term Recovery and Restoration
o   Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.
o   Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.
o   Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

The McCash Fire was located on July 31, 2021 around 7:00 pm. The fire was burning in timber with an understory of tall grass and brush in rugged, steep terrain in an area with limited roads and partially within the Marble Mountain Wilderness. The nearest towns are Somes Bar and Happy Camp, CA (Siskiyou County). As of 4:00 pm on October 15, 2021, a Type 3 Incident Management Team was assigned to the McCash Fire. The Type 3 Team has been focused on suppression repair and removal of hazard trees for several days and the majority of this work is complete.  The McCash burn area has received considerable precipitation over the last several days and is 100% contained as of 6:00 pm on October 27, 2021.Resources will gradually be drawn down as suppression repair and hazard tree removal objectives are met and management of the McCash Fire will be transitioned to the Klamath and Six Rivers National Forests at 10:00am on October 29, 2021.A forest closure remains in effect for the area around the McCash Fire.

Rough Patch,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Summary: The Rough Patch Complex on the Umpqua National Forest started July 29 when 20-plus lightning fires resulted from thunderstorms in the area.  Several more fires were added to the Complex including the Jack Fire when another storm moved through August 1, bringing the total identified fires to 42. Northwest Incident Management Team (IMT) 13 (Type 2) managed the Complex along with the Jack Fire.
On August 16, 2021, the Great Basin Management Team 2 (Type 1 IMT) assumed command of the fires at 6:00 a.m. Total size of the Rough Patch Complex was 12,956 acres. Several smaller fires had been contained by this time, with the largest fires being the Chaos, Little Bend Creek, Near Minky and Buckhead.
On August 28, Northern Rockies Team 1 (Type 1 IMT) assumed command of the fires.  The Rough Patch Complex then consisted of four fires: Chaos, Little Bend, Buckhead and Near Minky.   On September 10, Great Basin Management Team 2 (Type 1 IMT) assumed command of the Complex.  On September 23, Northwest Team 7 (Type 2 IMT) assumed command of the fire Complex at 6:00 a.m. The Rough Patch Complex consists of four primary fires, Chaos, Little Bend, Buckhead and Near Minky.  The Smith Fire from the Devils Knob Complex is in close proximity to the Near Minky Fire but managed by another incident management team. Multiple precipitation events drastically reduced the fire behavior moving the suppression tactics to suppression repair efforts. The Rocky Mountain Type 2 Blue Team assumed command of the fire on October 1, with the intent of reducing the footprint of the fire suppression tactics and continue the suppression repair efforts.   
The Rough Patch Complex is being managed under a full suppression strategy. Public and firefighter safety is the number one priority. In addition, protection of communities, timber resources, private property, highway corridors and recreational improvements are key considerations.

ABOUT THE ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST
The Angeles National Forest is a unique area nestled in the midst of an ever-changing and growing population in the Los Angeles area. The Forest is one of the few remaining open space areas in Southern California. The forest is an important part of the overall health and well-being of the area population. It provides open space, solitude from the everyday stress of modern living, a place to conduct research, a haven for wildlife, and offers a wide variety of recreation opportunities.
The Angeles National Forest was established by Executive Order in December 1892. It covers about 700,000 acres and is the backyard playground to the huge metropolitan area of Los Angeles. The Angeles manages the watersheds within its boundaries to provide valuable water to southern California and to protect surrounding communities from catastrophic floods.

Devils Knob Complex,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Devils Knob Complex on the Umpqua National Forest is a collection of 25 wildfires that started from lightning strikes on July 29 and August 1. The area burned by the fires has not increased in the past two weeks. On October 14th management of the Complex returned to the Umpqua National Forest under a local Incident Management Team.  The fires are 65% contained. Successive waves of cold, wet weather have almost extinguished the remainder of open perimeter and effectively prevented any additional growth. The work that remains is suppression repair, where roads, dozer lines and handlines are restored to proper drainage and protected against erosion from winter rains. Firefighters are felling and clearing fire-damaged trees that are likely to fall across roads and trails. As of this writing on October 14, the entire fire area and some surrounding public lands are closed to public entry because of unsafe conditions.
Closures: There is a temporary area closure in place for the Devils Knob Complex. For additional information see: Umpqua National Forest-Alerts and Notices. A Temporary flight restriction (TFR) remains in place over the fires. The TFR is valid through October 18. TFR violations can disrupt aerial firefighting operations and may force fire managers to ground essential aircraft. Wildfires are a no-fly zone for unauthorized aircraft, including drones. If you fly, we can’t. . http://knowbeforeyoufly.org.The Devils Knob Complex Facebook page is no longer being updated but is accessible for previously posted maps, photos and information.

Helicopters provided bucket drops in the fire area. Agency administrators and fire leadership initially determined the area to be unsafe for ground crews due to large boulders, steep slopes, a large number of snags, difficult terrain, and no safe locations to insert or extract crews. On September 6, the fire spotted (threw embers)into a continuous pocket of timber to the east near Little Boulder Park. Crews at this time began taking actions to protect private in-holdings and structures in the area. Crews are now able to safely engage some of the fire from the ground and are being supported by aircraft.Burnout operations are ongoing on the northeast side of the fire to reduce the risk to private property and structures south of Boulder. Great Basin Type 2 Incident Management Team #4 assumed command of the fire on September 22.

Firefighters are working around the clock to suppress the fires. As with all wildfires, the Incident Management Team is using a range of firefighting tactics to suppress the fire. Crews are conducting structure assessments, so fire personnel know where structures are located and are removing vegetation and debris to decrease the fuel load. This is an important tactic to provide structure protection.  Walker Creek Fire: Structure protection continued through the night as firefighters removed vegetation and any materials that could threaten structures.  In the northern area of the fire, dozers are constructing fire line to remove fuel. Work today will include constructing fireline from the fires end down to Bonaparte Lake, continued construction and improvement of containment and contingency lines, and scouting for spot fires.  Spur Fire: The fire pushed outside the northern containment line and was suppressed by crews and equipment.  Spot fires outside containment lines were also detected and suppressed utilizing engines, dozers, and hand crews. Smoke hampered aerial resources; but they remain available when conditions improve. Today’s activities will focus preparing Road 33, structure protection and suppressing new spot fires. Chickadee Creek Fire: Fire Personnel continue to work on increasing containment of the fire with the help of engine crews, working to enforce the line, and putting out any spot fires or hotspots along the line. Personnel will continue to look for hot spots and assist where needed.

Image options: [ Full Size ]Summary: On Aug. 3, 2021 a lightning storm ignited several small fires on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.   One of the fires that was ignited, the Pincer Creek Fire, is located 18 air miles east southeast of the Marblemount community in the Glacier Peak Wilderness. It is burning in very steep terrain in an old fire scar with numerous snags and heavy dead and down fuels.  Evacuations: None.  Over the past several weeks, the weather has shifted to a more fall like pattern with cloudy, moist, cool weather. “We are thankful that activity on the Pincer Creek Fire is minimal.” Said Kit Moffit, Acting Forest Fire Staff Officer for the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. “Based on the current weather forecast and minimal expected fire behavior, we are pleased to announce that Forest System Road #15 (Cascade River Road) will be reopened on September 16, 2021. We know that the Pincer Creek Fire closure has been a major inconvenience and we appreciate the public’s understanding.” Closures:  The Mt. Baker Ranger District Cascade River Trail, the Middle Fork Cascade Trail and South Fork Cascade Trail are closed to the public due to their proximity to the Pincer Creek Fire. The Sibley Creek Road and Hidden Lake Trail are not currently threatened by the fire, but are closed to allow firefighters to staff the lookout to support fire operations. This closure order is effective Aug 7. 2021 until rescinded: www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/mbs/alerts-notices.North Cascades National Park staff report that the Cascade River Road will be open to vehicular traffic to the El Dorado parking area (milepost 20). Access beyond that will be foot traffic only, due to debris and rocks that have fallen in an unrelated incident near the Boston Basin culvert. Crews will assess the damage over the next several days to determine a course of action.

Image options: [ Full Size ]Located 17 miles northwest of Plain, Washington, the Nason Fire is approximately 1,269 acres, burning in very steep, rocky terrain that is difficult to access. Its initial position high on a north facing slope along the Nason Ridge made it dangerous for firefighters to directly attack the fire. Fire managers then implemented indirect firefighting strategies, which were the safest available tactics due to the fire’s location.
Over the September 18-19 weekend, almost 1.5 inches of rain fell in the vicinity of the Nason Fire. Firefighters have started rehabilitation work on the fire, which consists mainly of chipping fuels and hazard tree removal on the 6700 and 6702 roads. Firefighters utilized Road 6700 as a containment line along the west and north edges of the fire; a portion of the road is closed for public safety as crews continue working to mitigate hazards.

With over 400 miles of containment line on the landscape, the focus is on repair work efforts to remove hazardous trees and slash from high-use areas, clear culverts and repair dozer and hand line to limit potential resource issues. Repair and rehabilitation work related to the Caldor Fire will continue for quite a while. A large number of forest personnel will be tasked with continuing the repair and rehabilitation for the foreseeable future.The fire will continue to creep and smolder within the fire area long into the winter. The public can expect to see smoke and possible single and/or group tree torching. Other dangers in the fire area include fire weakened hazard trees, heavy fuels that continue to smolder, stump holes, loose rock and debris on steep slopes, and hazmat from burned structures. All evacuation orders and warnings have been lifted as of October 4,2021.

The Western Montana All Hazards Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed command of the fire at 6:00AM on August 18, 2021. The fire is located primarily on Bureau of Land Management and private lands, under the direct fire protection of the Montana Department of Natural Resources & Conservation. The cause of the fire is lightning.  The fire is burning in heavy dead and down material, mixed conifer forests, and grazing lands. Firefighter access to the fire is difficult due to its remote location, lack of roads and steep terrain. Smokejumpers, aerial retardant drops and DNRC resources provided initial attack on the fire on 8/16 when the fire was detected. The fire is being managed under a full suppression strategy, utilizing direct attack where safe to do so. Public and firefighter safety are top priority in addition to protecting structure, private land and local communities. There are 56 firefighting personnel assigned to the fire with four (4) engines. Crews will begin patrolling the fire perimeter and will work to safely extinguish any burning vegetation occurring along the perimeter to prevent further fire spread. Cooler temperatures and above average relative humidity values may result in decrease fire activity and reduce fire spread over the next few days. Image: Smokejumper plane flying over Mannix Park fire on 8/16 and dropped fire retardant (red) near fire perimeter. Stage 2 Fire Restrictions are in place in Powell County. Check local Fire Restrictions at www.mtfireinfo.org Learn about Wildfire Preparedness in Powell County  Southwest Montana Smoke Outlook

Dixie Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] SPECIAL NOTE: Everyone near and downstream from the burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains and increased water runoff. Flash flooding may occur quickly during heavy rain events-be prepared to take action. Current weather and emergency notifications can be found at the National Weather Service website: www.weather.gov/sto/.
 Dixie Post-Fire BAER—Preparing for Rain Events
POST-FIRE WATERSHED CONDITIONS—KEY MESSAGES
While many wildfires cause minimal damage to the land and pose few threats to the land or people downstream, some fires cause damage that requires special efforts to prevent problems afterwards.
Thunderstorms and winter rain events in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains can result in high water runoff and flooding.
Wildfire increases the potential for flooding, post-fire soil erosion and debris flows that could impact campgrounds, fishing areas, homes, structures, roads, and other infrastructure within, adjacent to, and downstream from the burned areas.
Post-fire, watershed conditions will naturally receive and transport water and sediment differently than during pre-fire conditions.
The public and communities adjacent to and downstream from the wildfire areas should expect increased flooding and debris transport during less than average rain events.
SAFETY CONCERNS CONTINUE AFTER THE FIRE IS OUT
The potential for increased water runoff and debris flows are not just a one-year concern.
We need to recognize the threat potential of flash floods and debris flows may exist for the next several years, depending on the intensity of these storms.
For life and safety concerns, burned area national forest closures may need to be implemented prior to forecast rain events until the burned area fully recovers.
Residents and visitors should remain alert to weather events and plan ahead when travelling along roads within and downstream from the burned areas of the Dixie Fire.
ASSESSING DIXIE BURNED WATERSHEDS RESPONSE
A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team has been working with the Lassen National Forest and Plumas National Forest, to assess the condition of the watersheds on National Forest System (NFS) land burned in the Dixie Fire.
The BAER assessment team identifies potential emergency threats to critical BAER values, and recommends emergency stabilization response actions that are implemented on federal land to reduce potential post-fire threats.
BAER critical values that may be considered at-risk on federal lands are: 
§  Human life and safety. 
§  Property such as buildings, water systems and infrastructure, utility systems, road and trail prisms. 
§  Critical natural resources such as water, soil productivity and hydrologic function, areas where invasive species or noxious weeds may impact native or naturalized communities and may include critical habitat or suitable occupied habitat for federally listed threatened or endangered species. 
§  Critical cultural and heritage resources such as pre-historic and historic properties and sites.
ASSISTANCE FOR PRIVATE LAND AND HOMEOWNERS ADJACENT TO AND DOWNSTREAM FROM BURNED AREAS
For values and resources potentially impacted off federal lands, one of the most effective BAER strategies is interagency coordination with local cooperators who assist affected businesses, homes, and landowners with preparing for rain events. 
While multi-agency efforts are being taken to reduce the risks to life and safety adjacent to and downstream from the burned areas, nearby residents should develop individual plans to protect themselves and their property. 
The Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) work together and coordinate with other federal, state and local agencies, and counties that assist private landowners in preparing for increased run-off and potential flooding impacts. 
 NRCS and local sponsors prepare damage survey reports for eligible sites on private lands adjacent to and downstream from affected areas.  NRCS uses these reports, along with the Forest Service BAER team’s assessment report, to develop emergency measures to reduce the impacts from potential increased water and debris flows, and assist local sponsors to implement recommended emergency measures through its Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program: (www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045263.pdf). 
 All EWP Program–Recovery projects begin with a local sponsor or legal subdivision of state or tribal government. Eligible sponsors include cities, counties, towns, conservation districts, or any federally-recognized Native American tribe or tribal organization. Interested public and private landowners can apply for EWP Program–Recovery assistance through one of those sponsors. For more information on NRCS Disaster Assistance Programs: NRCS CA Post-Fire Disaster Assistance.

 THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY
There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:
-       Fire Suppression Repair
-       Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)
-       Long-Term Recovery and Restoration 
Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.
Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.
SPECIAL NOTE: Everyone near and downstream from burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains over the burn scars. Flash flooding may occur quickly during heavy rain events-be prepared to take action.

Forest Service BAER Program OverviewThe Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) program is designed to identify and manage potential risks to resources on National Forest System lands and reduce these threats through appropriate emergency measures to protect human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources. BAER is an emergency program for stabilization work that involves time-critical activities to be completed before the first damaging event to meet program objectives: BAER Objectives:•Determine whether imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands exist and take immediate actions, as appropriate, to manage the unacceptable risks.•If emergency conditions are identified, mitigate significant threats to health, safety, human life, property and critical cultural and natural resources.•Prescribe emergency response actions to stabilize and prevent unacceptable degradation to natural and cultural resources, to minimize threats to critical values resulting from the effects of a fire, or to repair/replace/construct physical improvements necessary to prevent degradation of land or resources.•Implement emergency response actions to help stabilize soil; control water, sediment and debris movement and potentially reduce threats to the BAER critical values identified above when an analysis shows that planned actions are likely to reduce risks substantially within the first year following containment of the fire.•Monitor the implementation and effectiveness of emergency treatments that were applied on National Forest System lands. While many wildfires cause minimal damage to the land and pose few threats to the land or people downstream, some fires result in damage that requires special efforts to reduce impacts afterwards. Loss of vegetation exposes soil to erosion; water run-off may increase and cause flooding, soil and rock may move downstream and damage property or fill reservoirs putting community water supplies and endangered species at-risk. The BAER team presents these findings in an assessment report that identifies immediate and emergency actions needed to address post-fire risks to human life and safety, property, cultural and critical natural resources. This includes early detection and rapid response (EDRR) treatments to prevent the spread of noxious weeds into native plant communities. The BAER report describes watershed pre- and post-fire watershed response information, areas of concern for life and property, and recommended short-term emergency stabilization measures for Forest Service lands that burned. In most cases, only a portion of the burned area is actually treated. Severely burned areas steep slopes, and places where water run-off will be excessive and may impact important resources, are focus areas and described in the BAER assessment report if they affect critical values. Time is critical if the emergency stabilization measures are to be effective. A BAER assessment team conducts field surveys and uses science-based models to rapidly evaluate and assess the burned area and prescribe emergency stabilization measures. The team generates a “Soil Burn Severity” map by using satellite imagery which is then validated and adjusted by BAER team field surveys to assess watershed conditions and model potential watershed response from the wildfire. The map identifies areas of soil burn severity by categories of very low/unburned, low, moderate, and high which may correspond to a projected increase in watershed response. The higher the burn severity, the less the soil will be able to absorb water when it rains. Without absorption, there will be increased run-off with the potential of flooding.

Route,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Overview
The Route Fire started on September 11th at 3:54 P.M. The fire is located near the near I-5 freeway, one mile south of the Templin Hwy.  The fire burned in brush and chaparral with a moderate rate of spread and quickly jumped Interstate 5 prompting the California Highway Patrol to shut the interstate down in both directions.   Later in the evening as the threat to motorists was reduced, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol were able to gradually open lanes to motorists and interstate commerce.
The fire was declared fully contained on September 17th.
Current Situation 
The fire is currently being managed by fire officials on the Emigrant Fire, monitoring conditions within the fire perimeter. 
The “Route” fire located on both sides of Interstate 5 which has been known as the Ridge Route.  The fire was named Route and the fire started near all three phases of the Ridge Route.

Please use caution when travelling near the area, fire crews continue to use these main routes to get to their work locations. Forest Service managed land burned in the Windy Fire remain closed under a Forest area closure. For public safety, the Trail of 100 Giants and other points of interest in the burned area are expected to remain closed until spring. Closed roads include Lloyd Meadow, Capinero, Crawford, Portuguese Pass and other Forest roads affected by recent wildfires. Fire hazards in these areas continue to pose an immediate threat, keeping the area closed until further notice. 
Tulare County has closed the Western Divide Highway (M107) and Parker Pass (M50) between Ponderosa and California Hot Springs/Johnsondale for the season. Winter recreation is available outside Forest closure areas, including over snow activities on the county roads.

Caldor Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]SPECIAL SAFETY NOTE: Everyone near and downstream from the burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains and increased water runoff. Flash flooding may occur quickly during heavy rain events-be prepared to take action. Current weather and emergency notifications can be found at the National Weather Service website: www.weather.gov/sto/.
 Caldor Post-Fire BAER—Preparing for Rain Events   POST-FIRE WATERSHED CONDITIONS—KEY MESSAGES   While many wildfires cause minimal damage to the land and pose few threats to the land or people downstream, some fires cause damage that requires special efforts to prevent problems afterwards.   Thunderstorms and winter rain events in the Sierra Nevada mountains can result in high water runoff and flooding.   Wildfire increases the potential for flooding, post-fire soil erosion and debris flows that could impact campgrounds, fishing areas, homes, structures, roads, and other infrastructure within, adjacent to, and downstream from the burned areas.   Post-fire, watershed conditions will naturally receive and transport water and sediment differently than during pre-fire conditions.   The public and communities adjacent to and downstream from the wildfire areas should expect increased flooding and debris transport during less than average rain events.   SAFETY CONCERNS CONTINUE AFTER THE FIRE IS OUT   The potential for increased water runoff and debris flows are not just a one-year concern.   We need to recognize the threat potential of flash floods and debris flows may exist for the next several years, depending on the intensity of these storms.   For life and safety concerns, burned area national forest closures may need to be implemented prior to forecast rain events until the burned area fully recovers.   Residents and visitors should remain alert to weather events and plan ahead when travelling along roads within and downstream from the burned areas of the Caldor Fire.   ASSESSING CALDOR BURNED WATERSHEDS RESPONSE   A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team has been working with the Eldorado National Forest and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, to assess the condition of the watersheds on National Forest System (NFS) land burned in the Caldor Fire.   The BAER assessment team identifies potential emergency threats to critical BAER values, and recommends emergency stabilization response actions that are implemented on federal land to reduce potential post-fire threats.   BAER critical values that may be considered at-risk on federal lands are:   §  Human life and safety.   §  Property such as buildings, water systems and infrastructure, utility systems, road and trail prisms.   §  Critical natural resources such as water, soil productivity and hydrologic function, areas where invasive species or noxious weeds may impact native or naturalized communities and may include critical habitat or suitable occupied habitat for federally listed threatened or endangered species.   §  Critical cultural and heritage resources such as pre-historic and historic properties and sites.   ASSISTANCE FOR PRIVATE LAND AND HOMEOWNERS ADJACENT TO AND DOWNSTREAM FROM BURNED AREAS   For values and resources potentially impacted off federal lands, one of the most effective BAER strategies is interagency coordination with local cooperators who assist affected businesses, homes, and landowners with preparing for rain events.    While multi-agency efforts are being taken to reduce the risks to life and safety adjacent to and downstream from the burned areas, nearby residents should develop individual plans to protect themselves and their property.    The Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) work together and coordinate with other federal, state and local agencies, and counties that assist private landowners in preparing for increased run-off and potential flooding impacts.   NRCS and local sponsors prepare damage survey reports for eligible sites on private lands adjacent to and downstream from affected areas.  NRCS uses these reports, along with the Forest Service BAER team’s assessment report, to develop emergency measures to reduce the impacts from potential increased water and debris flows, and assist local sponsors to implement recommended emergency measures through its Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program: (www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045263.pdf).   All EWP Program–Recovery projects begin with a local sponsor or legal subdivision of state or tribal government. Eligible sponsors include cities, counties, towns, conservation districts, or any federally-recognized Native American tribe or tribal organization. Interested public and private landowners can apply for EWP Program–Recovery assistance through one of those sponsors.

Big Meadow Fire,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Late season wildfire reaches 2,600 acres On Thursday, September 9, Harney County received abundant late afternoon and evening lightning strikes. Quick response from the Silver Creek Rangeland Fire Protection Association, Burns Interagency Fire Zone and private contractors kept the Silver Creek fire at 86 acres before being fully contained on September 11. The Big Meadow fire, burning in heavy timber continued to grow. Ground crews will continue securing control lines and mop-up from the perimeter as containment improves. Northwest Interagency Incident Management Team 7 assumed command of the Big Meadow fire on September 13. Their Incident Command Post and the firefighter base camp are set up in Hines, Oregon.  A closure of both Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service-administered public lands in the Big Meadow fire area is in place. Roads and trails within the closure are off limits to all access – hiking, biking, horseback, ATV, vehicle, etc. – until further notice. Boundary roads along the closure remain open. Maps of the closure area are available at the BLM office at 28910 Highway 20 West in Hines, the Riley Store, and Harney County Sporting Goods, and posted at entry roads in the fire vicinity. Remember! Wildfire danger still exists! Public use restrictions are still in place – no campfires, personal chainsaw use, explosives, or parking or driving off road.

Image options: [ Full Size ] THREE PHASES OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY

There are three phases of recovery following wildfires on federal lands:
-       Fire Suppression Repair
-       Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER)
-       Long-Term Recovery and Restoration
o   Fire Suppression Repair is a series of immediate post-fire actions taken to repair damages and minimize potential soil erosion and impacts resulting from fire suppression activities and usually begins before the fire is contained, and before the demobilization of an Incident Management Team. This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.
o   Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.
o   Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.

Emigrant,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Emigrant Fire Story The Emigrant fire started as tractor-trailer fire on the northbound Vista Del Lago exit on Interstate 5 near Pyramid Lake. The first report into the Angeles National Forest was at 1:34 p.m. on September 17, 2021.   The first firefighters on-scene reported that the fire had quickly spread to the vegetation adjacent to the interstate highway and ran up the slope. With the hot, dry weather and wind, the fire quickly spread in a northerly direction, burning uphill in steep terrain with gullies and drop-offs.   The US Forest Service along with Los Angeles County Fire Department sent considerable ground and aerial firefighters to the scene and battled the fire. Initially a total of twelve aircraft responded to the fire, including retardant dropping airtankers, super scoopers and helicopters providing much needed assistance to ground based firefighters. On the ground, fire engines, hand crews, fire dozers and water tenders attacked the flanks of the fire, eventually halting the forward movement of the fire.  The California Highway Patrol, and Caltrans quickly closed both north and southbound off-ramps to Vista Del Lago as well as shutting down the right two lanes of northbound Interstate 5, well into the late evening. Firefighters supported by aircraft both day and night made an aggressive attack held the fire to 255 acres after the second day. The U.S. Forest Service brought in additional firefighting resources into Southern California to supplement fire suppression efforts. On this incident, firefighters and apparatus traveled from as far as Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Arizona, and assisted in fire suppression.   Current Conditions                     ~~Final~~ The fire is being held at 255 acres and 100% containment was reached at 6:00pm on September 27, 2021. The fire burned in a northernly direction, east of Interstate 5 and north of the Vista Del Lago overpass, which is east of Pyramid Lake. The fire remains a potential threat to a high-pressure natural gas line, power transmission lines, homes in the area as well as interstate commerce on Interstate 5. Firefighters have contained the fire.  Both the Emigrant and Route fires will be in patrol status, with firefighters monitoring conditions within fire control lines.  The fire is named “Emigrant” since the location was near Emigrant Landing Day Use Area at Pyramid Lake.

Southwest District BLM Prescribed Fire ,"

The Bureau of Land Management Southwest District plans to conduct several prescribed burns beginning early October or as conditions allow. The prescribed burn projects will be on the Gunnison, Tres Rios and Uncompahgre Field Offices. The planned burns are part of larger projects to reduce hazardous fuels; protect wildland-urban interface communities; improve big game habitat, sage grouse habitat, and range conditions; and reintroduce fire to a fire-adapted ecosystem to restore healthy forests and species diversity.  While no road closures are expected during the projects, camping near the units is discouraged due to increased traffic and likelihood of smoke in the area, particularly at night. Multiple days of burning may occur throughout the fall into the winter, as fuel conditions and weather permit. Project areas will be monitored once completed to ensure public safety. While smoke may be visible in the burn area at times, most of the smoke will lift and dissipate during the warmest parts of the day. Expect visible smoke in the area for several days after each burn is completed as vegetation in the interior continues to smolder. The BLM obtained smoke permits from the Colorado State Air Pollution Control Division, which identify atmospheric conditions under which the burns can be implemented. Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, visit https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health.

This work repairs the hand and dozer fire lines, roads, trails, staging areas, safety zones, and drop points used during fire suppression efforts.  o   Emergency Stabilization-Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) is a rapid assessment of burned watersheds by a BAER team to identify imminent post-wildfire threats to human life and safety, property, and critical natural or cultural resources on National Forest System lands and take immediate actions to implement emergency stabilization measures before the first post-fire damaging events. Fires result in loss of vegetation, exposure of soil to erosion, and increased water runoff that may lead to flooding, increased sediment, debris flows, and damage to critical natural and cultural resources. BAER actions such as: mulching, seeding, installation of erosion and water run-off control structures, temporary barriers to protect recovering areas, and installation of warning signs may be implemented. BAER work may also replace safety related facilities; remove safety hazards; prevent permanent loss of habitat for threatened and endangered species; prevent the spread of noxious weeds, and protect critical cultural resources.  o   Long-Term Recovery and Restoration utilizes non-emergency actions to improve fire-damaged lands that are unlikely to recover naturally and to repair or replace facilities damaged by the fire that are not critical to life and safety. This phase may include restoring burned habitat, reforestation, other planting or seeding, monitoring fire effects, replacing burned fences, interpreting cultural sites, treating noxious weed infestations, and installing interpretive signs.  SPECIAL NOTE: Everyone near and downstream from the burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains over the burn scars. Flash flooding may occur quickly during heavy rain events-be prepared to take action.

Schneider Springs BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team was recently organized by the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest to begin an assessment of the Schneider Springs Fire burning outside Naches, WA. BAER teams conduct rapid assessments that evaluate post-fire conditions and determine the potential for increased flooding, sediment flows, and rockslides. 
 BAER teams consist of many disciplines including hydrologists, geologists, soil scientists, road engineers, botanists, biologists, and archeologists from both federal and state agencies. The team will first survey the burned area and collect field data. BAER teams use this information to produce a “Soil Burn Severity” map and inform modeling. Determining soil burn severity is the first step in assessing potential watershed impacts to values that may be at-risk following a wildfire. Other science products describing the post-fire situation will follow.    BAER teams ultimately produce an assessment that describes post-fire conditions along with recommended emergency stabilization measures and actions. The team then presents its findings to the Forest Supervisor and interagency cooperators.   BAER emergency stabilization efforts are focused on the protection of human life and safety, property, and critical cultural and natural resource values on National Forest System Lands.  The Schneider Springs Fire BAER assessment team will hold its formal team kick-off (internal meeting) on Tuesday, October 12, 2021, and anticipates that it will take approximately two weeks to complete their burn area assessment.

CAIWA Annual Academy,"

 The 23rd annual Capital Area Interagency Wildfire and Incident Management Academy (CAIWA) began this week at the Camp Swift National Guard Facility in Bastrop, Texas. The academy will take place October 8-20, 2021.Each year, firefighters travel from across the state and nation to attend the academy to continue their education and earn National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) training qualifications. The mission of Texas Interagency Wildfire and Incident Management Academies, including CAIWA, is to enhance wildland firefighters’ knowledge, utilizing NWCG standards, while promoting safe and cost-effective operations. Four prescribed fires are expected to take place during this year's academy, one each during two sessions of S-130/190: Firefighter Training and Introduction to Wildland Fire Behavior and one each during two sessions of S-219: Firing Operations courses.While these prescribed fires play an instrumental role in the continuing education of student wildland firefighters, they are also equally important to the ecosystems of Central Texas. After the 2011 Bastrop Complex Fire burned approximately 32,000 acres of the Lost Pines, Camp Swift now holds some of the largest tracks of the mature, genetically different, loblolly pines in the region. Even with the smaller nature of these burns, they are a part of larger projects to reduce hazardous fuels; protect wildland-urban interface communities; improve habitat and forest conditions; and reintroduce fire to a fire-adapted ecosystem to restore healthy forests and species diversity.  Academy overhead work in close cooperation with the local office of emergency management and fire department to insure clear communication. Specific information on the individual prescribed burn projects will be posted in the News section.

David Canyon RX - Sandia RD,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The primary objective of this burn is hazard fuel reduction.  Fuel loadings are light to moderate and ladder fuels are minimal due to thinning operations that have taken place or will take place prior to burning.  Objectives will be easily achieved using a standard strip head ignition pattern, and a locally typical burn organization with two levels of supervision consisting of a Type 2 Burn Boss supervising a Firing Boss and a Holding Boss.   Potential safety hazards are typical and easily mitigated and addressed in briefings.  Light to moderate overnight smoke impacts to local residences are expected, with short periods of moderate to heavy impacts during ignition.  These impacts will be mitigated by burning on days with good or better ventilation when possible, by monitoring smoke impacts and varying the amount and pattern of ignition as necessary.   Private residences are adjacent to the burn units, but are located in areas of mixed fuels comprised of ponderosa pine with grass understory and pinion juniper with very sparse ground fuels, and are moderately accessible for defense or monitoring. Because of the fuel type and gentle topography around these residences, any spot fires that do occur will be rapidly suppressed using direct attack with holding resources.

Fall 2021 Bastrop County Prescribed Burn,"

Prescribed burns that were scheduled to take place during the Fall/Winter of 2021 have been postponed due to weather concerns. Additional burns are planned for January 2022 
Texas A&M Forest Service is planning for several prescribed burns to take place during 2022 in Bastrop County. These burns will cover approximately 2,500 acres on Camp Swift Training Center and 500 acres on a Texas A&M Forest Service property near Rosanky, TX. Texas A&M Forest Service is proud to continue working on a long partnership with the Texas Army National Guard to achieve the land management goals on the Camp Swift Training Center. The fuels in these units will consist of both grass and mature trees. Prescribed burns are conducted to reduce hazardous fuel loading and enhance local ecosystems. These burns will take place under a tiered leadership team of a Type 2 Burn Boss who supervises a Firing Boss and a Holding Boss. Together this team will work to avoid potential safety hazards and lead successful burns. Residents around both of these areas can expect some lingering smoke effects overnight after the burns and see some moderate to heavy smoke impacts for short periods during ignition operations. These effects will be mitigated by burning on days with good ventilation so that smoke will rise up and away from local areas. In addition, ignition tactics are often altered to reduce the smoke impacts on the local communities. We will work in conjunction with local firefighters to ensure readiness and safety around these prescribed burns.More information will be published on this page as weather conditions allow for safe burning operations.

River Complex Post-Fire BAER,"

Image options: [ Full Size ] SPECIAL SAFETY NOTE: Everyone near and downstream from the burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains, increased water runoff. Flash flooding and landslides may occur quickly during heavy rain events-be prepared to take action – especially at these locations such as Walker, Grider, Horse Creek, Scott River, and others. Current weather and emergency notifications can be found at the National Weather Service websites: wwwweather.gov/eka/ and www.weather.gov/sto/.  Post-Fire BAER—Preparing for Rain Events POST-FIRE WATERSHED CONDITIONS—KEY MESSAGES While many wildfires cause minimal damage to the land and pose few threats to the land or people downstream, some fires cause damage that requires special efforts to prevent problems afterwards. Thunderstorms and winter rain events in the Sierra Nevada, Cascade and Klamath mountains can result in high water runoff and flooding. Wildfire increases the potential for flooding, post-fire soil erosion and debris flows that could impact campgrounds, fishing areas, homes, structures, roads, and other infrastructure within, adjacent to, and downstream from the burned areas. Post-fire, watershed conditions will naturally receive and transport water and sediment differently than during pre-fire conditions. The public and communities adjacent to and downstream from the wildfire areas should expect increased flooding and debris transport during less than average rain events. SAFETY CONCERNS CONTINUE AFTER THE FIRE IS OUT The potential for increased water runoff and debris flows are not just a one-year concern. We need to recognize the threat potential of flash floods and debris flows may exist for the next several years, depending on the intensity of these storms. For life and safety concerns, burned area national forest closures may need to be implemented prior to forecast rain events until the burned area fully recovers. Residents and visitors should remain alert to weather events and plan ahead when travelling along roads within and downstream from the burned areas of the River Complex and McCash fires. ASSESSING MCCASH FIRE & RIVER COMPLEX BURNED WATERSHEDS RESPONSE A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team has been working with the Shasta-Trinity, Klamath and Six Rivers National Forests, to assess the condition of the watersheds on National Forest System (NFS) land burned in the River Complex and McCash fires. The BAER assessment team identifies potential emergency threats to critical BAER values, and recommends emergency stabilization response actions that are implemented on federal land to reduce potential post-fire threats. BAER critical values that may be considered at-risk on federal lands are:  §  Human life and safety.  §  Property such as buildings, water systems and infrastructure, utility systems, road and trail prisms.  §  Critical natural resources such as water, soil productivity and hydrologic function, areas where invasive species or noxious weeds may impact native or naturalized communities and may include critical habitat or suitable occupied habitat for federally listed threatened or endangered species.  §  Critical cultural and heritage resources such as pre-historic and historic properties and sites. 
ASSISTANCE FOR PRIVATE LAND AND HOMEOWNERS ADJACENT TO AND DOWNSTREAM FROM BURNED AREAS For values and resources potentially impacted off federal lands, one of the most effective BAER strategies is interagency coordination with local cooperators who assist affected businesses, homes, and landowners with preparing for rain events.  While multi-agency efforts are being taken to reduce the risks to life and safety adjacent to and downstream from the burned areas, nearby residents should develop individual plans to protect themselves and their property.  The Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) work together and coordinate with other federal, state and local agencies, and counties that assist private landowners in preparing for increased run-off and potential flooding impacts.   NRCS and local sponsors prepare damage survey reports for eligible sites on private lands adjacent to and downstream from affected areas.  NRCS uses these reports, along with the Forest Service BAER team’s assessment report, to develop emergency measures to reduce the impacts from potential increased water and debris flows, and assist local sponsors to implement recommended emergency measures through its Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program: (www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045263.pdf).   All EWP Program–Recovery projects begin with a local sponsor or legal subdivision of state or tribal government. Eligible sponsors include cities, counties, towns, conservation districts, or any federally-recognized Native American tribe or tribal organization. Interested public and private landowners can apply for EWP Program–Recovery assistance through one of those sponsors. For more information on NRCS Disaster Assistance Programs: NRCS CA Post-Fire Disaster Assistance.  The following state and local county offices of emergency management promote preparedness through its emergency services programs to assist the public to prepare for, respond appropriately to, and quickly recover from natural emergencies that may impact county residents and visitors: ·       Recovering from Wildfire-Damage Assessments ·       Trinity County Office of Emergency Services  ·       Trinity County Water Resources  ·       Trinity County Department of Transportation ·       Siskiyou County Emergency Services  ·       Siskiyou County Emergency Preparedness  ·       Siskiyou County Flood Control  ·       Siskiyou County Public Works  Homes or businesses that could be impacted by flooding from federal land that resulted from wildfires may be eligible for flood insurance coverage from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  Information about NFIP is available through FEMA at www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program, or FEMA Wildfire Increases Flood Risk.

Shasta-Trinity RX Burning 2021-2022,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]The Shasta-Trinity National Forest plans to initiate prescribed fire operations this fall and winter as weather patterns shift to cooler temperatures and wetter conditions. The forest recognizes the significant impacts that have occurred as part of the 2021 summer fire season and the extreme conditions that existed throughout much of the summer. Current fuels and fire behavior metrics have moderated significantly and will continue to moderate as days become shorter, evenings cooler and wetter weather approaches. The decision to implement a specific prescribed fire project accounts for the current weather and fuels conditions, the predicted weather conditions, and resource availability. Fire management staff across the forest monitor these conditions and look for appropriate implementation windows that align with the prescription and parameters set in the agency approved prescribed fire plan. The forest will not conduct any prescribed fire operations until conditions match those required in the appropriate prescribed fire plan or plans.  
Over the next several months the public may see or smell smoke in various parts of the forest from prescribed fire activities. These projects may have some short-term impacts on air quality levels; however, the Forest Service will comply with all Local, State and Federal air quality regulations and coordination with local air quality regulators will take place.
“Prescribed fire is an important tool used to meet fire management and ecological objectives. Prescribed fires reduce fuel loadings and the intensity of future fires while also enhancing and restoring habitats for fire adapted plants and animals. Most of the ecosystems in Northern California evolved with fire and, historically, fire played a critical role in the functioning of these systems.” said Forest Assistant Fire Management Officer, Kevin Osborne. “The forest’s fire management employees take prescribed fire very seriously. Conditions must meet certain criteria, including weather and vegetation factors, before we will implement a prescribed fire.”
Prescribed fire is a tool that is used to mimic the natural role of fire in the environment, create resilient forests, and to decrease future risk to life, property, and natural resources. Managing fire on the landscape promotes naturally occurring processes that native plants and animals rely upon. It affords opportunity for new growth to take place by removing dead and dying vegetation. At the same time, it decreases the threat posed by future wildfires and improves the resiliency of forest landscapes.
Weather is an essential factor in the planning and implementation of a prescribed fire. Wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity, and measurable moisture in vegetation are all taken into consideration, especially during a drought, prior to initiating any burning activities. The current drought conditions Northern California is experiencing may impact the timing and ability to accomplish prescribed fire this fall.
Areas where prescribed fire is planned include:National Recreation Area (NRA – Shasta Lake area): O’Brien Mtn. near Packers Bay; northeast of Jones Valley between Squaw and Pit arm of Shasta Lake; near bully hill between McCloud arm and Squaw arm of Shasta Lake; west of Lakeshore between Charlie Creek and Little Dog Creek; north of Lakeshore along Forest Road; in Lakeshore area proper off of Lakeshore drive and near Antlers marina; and west of Jones Valley in the Silverthorn area.

Flash flooding and landslides may occur quickly during heavy rain events-be prepared to take action – especially at these locations such as Walker, Grider, Horse Creek, Scott River, and others. Current weather and emergency notifications can be found at the National Weather Service websites: wwwweather.gov/eka/ and www.weather.gov/sto/.
Post-Fire BAER—Preparing for Rain Events
POST-FIRE WATERSHED CONDITIONS—KEY MESSAGES
While many wildfires cause minimal damage to the land and pose few threats to the land or people downstream, some fires cause damage that requires special efforts to prevent problems afterwards.
Thunderstorms and winter rain events in the Sierra Nevada, Cascade and Klamath mountains can result in high water runoff and flooding.
Wildfire increases the potential for flooding, post-fire soil erosion and debris flows that could impact campgrounds, fishing areas, homes, structures, roads, and other infrastructure within, adjacent to, and downstream from the burned areas.
Post-fire, watershed conditions will naturally receive and transport water and sediment differently than during pre-fire conditions.
The public and communities adjacent to and downstream from the wildfire areas should expect increased flooding and debris transport during less than average rain events.
SAFETY CONCERNS CONTINUE AFTER THE FIRE IS OUT
The potential for increased water runoff and debris flows are not just a one-year concern.
We need to recognize the threat potential of flash floods and debris flows may exist for the next several years, depending on the intensity of these storms.
For life and safety concerns, burned area national forest closures may need to be implemented prior to forecast rain events until the burned area fully recovers.
Residents and visitors should remain alert to weather events and plan ahead when travelling along roads within and downstream from the burned areas of the River Complex and McCash fires.
ASSESSING MCCASH FIRE & RIVER COMPLEX BURNED WATERSHEDS RESPONSE
A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team has been working with the Shasta-Trinity, Klamath and Six Rivers National Forests, to assess the condition of the watersheds on National Forest System (NFS) land burned in the River Complex and McCash fires.
The BAER assessment team identifies potential emergency threats to critical BAER values, and recommends emergency stabilization response actions that are implemented on federal land to reduce potential post-fire threats.
BAER critical values that may be considered at-risk on federal lands are:§  Human life and safety.§  Property such as buildings, water systems and infrastructure, utility systems, road and trail prisms.§  Critical natural resources such as water, soil productivity and hydrologic function, areas where invasive species or noxious weeds may impact native or naturalized communities and may include critical habitat or suitable occupied habitat for federally listed threatened or endangered species.§  Critical cultural and heritage resources such as pre-historic and historic properties and sites.
ASSISTANCE FOR PRIVATE LAND AND HOMEOWNERS ADJACENT TO AND DOWNSTREAM FROM BURNED AREAS
For values and resources potentially impacted off federal lands, one of the most effective BAER strategies is interagency coordination with local cooperators who assist affected businesses, homes, and landowners with preparing for rain events. 
While multi-agency efforts are being taken to reduce the risks to life and safety adjacent to and downstream from the burned areas, nearby residents should develop individual plans to protect themselves and their property. 
The Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) work together and coordinate with other federal, state and local agencies, and counties that assist private landowners in preparing for increased run-off and potential flooding impacts.
NRCS and local sponsors prepare damage survey reports for eligible sites on private lands adjacent to and downstream from affected areas.  NRCS uses these reports, along with the Forest Service BAER team’s assessment report, to develop emergency measures to reduce the impacts from potential increased water and debris flows, and assist local sponsors to implement recommended emergency measures through its Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program: (www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1045263.pdf).
All EWP Program–Recovery projects begin with a local sponsor or legal subdivision of state or tribal government. Eligible sponsors include cities, counties, towns, conservation districts, or any federally-recognized Native American tribe or tribal organization. Interested public and private landowners can apply for EWP Program–Recovery assistance through one of those sponsors.

Valley RX Burns,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Starting Wednesday, November 3rd, fire crews will be prescribed burning units 11 & 16 in Yosemite Valley. This is a continuation of burns conducted a week ago. Unit 11 is located south of Southside Drive near the El Capitan Crossover and Unit 16 is located between Southside Drive and the Four Mile trailhead. Ignitions will occur over the next few days. There will be trail closures in Yosemite Valley, including the Valley Loop Trail from the Four Mile trailhead to the El Captain crossover road along Southside Drive. Prescribed burn units have been carefully designed to meet multiple objectives; the objectives of this prescribed burn are to restore and maintain plant communities shaped by Native Americans, restore fire and a more natural ecosystem structure to communities, maintain meadows and healthy stands of conifers, reduce hazardous fuels, and provide protection to infrastructure. Each prescribed burn unit has defined weather parameters and firing patterns to ensure the objectives for each unit have a high potential for success. Yosemite fire and resources staff will monitor all prescribed burns to evaluate achievement of goals and help guide future prescriptions.
Visitors and employees should be aware that smoke may be present starting Wednesday and could linger to a much lesser degree into next week as large logs are consumed. Fire managers work closely with Park staff and the local air pollution control districts to time the prescribed burns to coincide with favorable weather and smoke dispersion conditions. Smoke impacts are always a consideration in the decision to begin any prescribed burning operation. Burning will only be conducted under favorable dispersal conditions as specified in the smoke permit.

Mountainair Ranger District Plans for Weekend Prescribed Burn in the Thunderbird Area Starting October 30  Albuquerque, NM – October 29, 2021 – Pending favorable conditions, fire managers on the Cibola National Forest & National Grasslands (NF & NGs) may implement the previously announced Thunderbird prescribed fire on the Mountainair Ranger District on Saturday, Oct. 30 and possibly continue Sunday Oct. 31 if necessary. Fire crews are looking at burning 148 acres on the Thunderbird Ecosystem Management Project. The burn unit is located north of FR 275 and west of Game Road. The Cibola NF & NGs manages all prescribed fires in compliance with New Mexico state regulations on air quality and smoke management. Smoke may be visible in the surrounding areas of Game Road, Mountainair, Punta de Agua, Manzano, the Estancia Valley or west Manzano communities such as Rio Communities, Belen or Los Lunas. The decision to proceed continues to depend on multiple factors, including resource availability, fuel moisture levels, air quality and forecast weather.  Prescribed burns are designed to meet specific objectives and are always managed with firefighter and public safety as the first priority. Prescribed fires are one of the most effective tools available to resource managers for restoring fire-adapted ecosystems and reducing the risk of high-severity wildfire. Fire managers use prescribed fire to improve forest health, remove hazardous fuels, increase firefighter safety, enhance wildlife habitat, and protect communities and watersheds. With fire there is smoke, but compared to wildfires, prescribed fires are shorter in duration and are conducted under weather conditions to minimize the impact of smoke on the public. Fire crews use tactics such as starting early in the day and ending ignitions early in the afternoon to allow for the most ventilation possible throughout the burn and dividing blocks into smaller units to minimize smoke impacts as much as possible. However, smoke may be visible periodically from local communities and the surrounding areas for the duration of the project until the burning vegetation is out. Information on air quality and protecting your health can be found online at the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) website. All fire updates will be posted on the Cibola NF & NGs website, New Mexico Fire Information website and on the  Cibola NF & NGs Facebook & Twitter pages.

Liberty Prescribed Fire Information Great Sand Dunes National Park and PreserveNational Park ServiceRio Grande National ForestUS Forest Service
Great Sand Dunes Plans Prescribed Burn for Week of November 8  Overview: As part of Great Sand Dunes National Park’s hazardous fuels reduction efforts, the park in partnership with Rio Grande National Forest, is preparing to conduct a prescribed burn on up to 3,300 acres near the park’s northern boundary. The project area is located south of Baca Grande Subdivision, and approximately three miles south of Crestone, Colorado. The project is planned from November 8-12, if favorable weather and fuel conditions permit. These dates occur between hunting seasons and were selected to reduce impacts to recreational users on adjacent public lands where hunting is allowed. Hunting is not allowed within the national park where the prescribed burn will take place.What to Expect: On the days of the burn, firefighters will be in the area of ignitions throughout the day. Traffic on the Liberty Road may be heavy so please use caution if traveling in the area. Smoke will be most visible during the warmest part of the day when fire will be most active. Flames may be visible from some locations. Firefighters will be on scene through the days of the burn; the fire may be left unattended overnight provided that fire activity does not indicate that the fire will move beyond the unit boundaries. The project area will be patrolled and monitored for hot spots days after ignitions until the fire is determined to be out. Weather & Fuel Conditions: Prior to and during prescribed burns, fire managers closely monitor weather conditions with multiple weather forecasts generated by the National Weather Service. Forecasts are customized to the burn location with frequent on-site weather measurements. Fire personnel at the scene are constantly monitoring conditions during a prescribed burn and adapt accordingly. If at any time conditions are outside of predetermined acceptable levels, the ignitions will be stopped. Smoke: On the days of the burn, smoke will be visible from the Crestone and Baca Grande subdivisions, Colorado State Highway 17, and other locations in the San Luis Valley. With cooler temperatures in the evening, smoke may linger and accumulate in low-lying areas. Even after firefighters stop ignitions, interior areas of the burn unit may continue to burn or smolder and continue producing smoke. Air quality considerations are an important part of prescribed fire, and each fire prescription is planned to disperse smoke rapidly and reduce lingering haze.Possible closures: The fire operation will remain west of Liberty Road. Temporary closures along Liberty Road may occur during the operation to ensure public health and safety when firefighters are working along the road.  For More Information: Great Sand Dunes Visitor Center: (719) 378-6341Email: GRSA_Interpretation@nps.gov InciWeb: https://inciweb.nwcg.gov  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GreatSandDunesNPP/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/GreatDunesNPS

Hoosier National Forest Prescribed Fire ,"

Bedford, Indiana. October 22, 2021 — The U.S. Forest Service plans to conduct seasonal prescribed burning to maintain, restore or improve early successional habitat, maintain wetlands, restore and maintain unique barren ecosystems, regenerate oak and hickory tree species and improve soil health by naturally returning nutrients to the soil.  Historical data shows that throughout history natural occurring fire played a vital and necessary role in sustaining the eastern deciduous forest ecosystem. Scientific research supports the use of prescribed burning to reintroduce low intensity fire to its natural role within the ecosystem. Prescribed burning also reduces fuel loading, thereby lowering the risk of catastrophic wildfire.  
Approximately 4,500 - 5,000 acres are planned to receive treatment with prescribed fire in the fall of 2021 on National Forest System lands in the following counties:  Brown, Crawford, Jackson, Martin, Monroe, Lawrence, and Perry. 
U.S. Forest Service fire managers utilize National Weather Service data to determine the best days to burn to achieve desired effects and to maximize safety. Many specific conditions must be met for a burn to occur, including fuel moisture, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity, among other factors. Decisions are generally made the day of the burn once parameters have been measured or forecasted. Therefore, advance specific notification for a particular burn can be difficult. Forest staff notifies the public in the immediate area of the prescribed burn. The public is advised to check the forest’s social media accounts for announcements of burns on Facebook and Twitter.  Maps and additional details of the burn areas will be available through InciWeb. .
All designated burn areas will not be accessible to the public on the day of the burn and for some time after the burn until the area is considered safe. If any hazards are identified within the burn area, the area may be inaccessible for several days for public safety. Burning may affect access to hunting areas. For your safety, please contact the Indiana Interagency Coordination Center dispatch (812-547-9262) if you plan to hunt or camp in or near prescribed burn areas.
An unfortunate side effect of prescribed burning is smoke. Fire managers burn only under atmospheric conditions specified in a burn plan and rely on scientific data to choose days in which the impacts of smoke are minimized. Smoke plumes from a prescribed fire usually rise high into the air where the smoke dissipates.  When smoke is present, motorists should reduce speeds and turn on headlights.
All burns are implemented under carefully planned prescriptions and protocols to mitigate the risk of an escaped fire and smoke exposure to communities. All planned activities have been carefully coordinated with county emergency management agencies. Forest neighbors who wish to be notified of a specific date of a burn, or those who wish to report medical conditions that could be affected by smoke, may contact the Indiana Interagency Coordination Center Dispatcher at 812-547-9262.

Big Mountain Prescribed Burn,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]This fall Monongahela National Forest officials plan to conduct a prescribed burn on 257 acres of National Forest System land in the Big Mountain area, southwest of Cherry Grove in Pendleton County. The Forest Service began prescribed burning in the Big Mountain area in 2018 and will continue to burn for the next several years. Why do we burn? Reintroducing fire into the forest will:  
 Restore historic fire regimes Improve wildlife habitat Enhance forest structure and age diversity Improve oak regeneration Control tree diseases and insects Reduce hazardous fuel levels  How do we manage a prescribed burn?Fire managers prepare a burn plan for each prescribed burn describing the appropriate conditions needed to conduct the burn safely and achieve the desired results. Burn plans consider public safety, protection of private property, staffing and equipment needs, temperature, humidity, wind, moisture of the vegetation, and conditions for the dispersal of smoke. Appropriate conditions must be met before igniting prescribed burns. A control line is established around each burn area before ignition, using hand tools and other equipment, roads, trails, and natural features such as creeks and other water sources. 
Public Safety Each burn area will be closed to the public on the day of the burn. The area may be closed for several days for public safety. Signs will be posted along the fire line and at entry points into the area. Area residents and travelers may see or smell smoke during fire operations. If you encounter smoke on the highway, slow down, turn on your vehicle’s lights and drive appropriately for the conditions.  
Public Notification The Forest Service will notify local 911 centers and radio stations on the day of the burn. Information, maps and the latest updates are available at inciweb.gov.

Klamath NF Fall/Winter '21 Rx Burning,"

Image options: [ Full Size ]Klamath National Forest Fall/Winter 2021 Prescribed BurningRecent cooler temperatures and precipitation have allowed fire managers to shift gears to implementing prescribed fire in the form of pile burns across the Klamath National Forest.    The ecosystems in the Klamath National Forest evolved with frequent mixed-severity fire. This essential component of the ecosystem was removed over more than a century of fire suppression, resulting in an unnatural accumulation of fuels in the forest. Prescribed burning is a tool the fire managers use to return fire to the landscape when conditions are favorable to reduce fuel loadings within ecosystems, making them more resilient to the effects from future wildfires.  Fuels reduction using prescribed fire is also an effective way to provide firefighters with safer places to engage wildfires when they occur. Prescribed fire treatments have been found to be successful in reducing flame lengths during subsequent wildfire events, providing increased opportunities for suppression operations. These effects make prescribed fire particularly useful as a treatment around communities and other values within the wildland.   The Klamath National Forest typically implements prescribed underburns in the fall and spring when conditions are favorable. Fall usually presents an ideal but short window for prescribed underburning, since the fuels are dry enough to carry fire, yet weather conditions have moderated enough to subdue fire behavior and precipitation events associated with winter are on the horizon. Pile burning typically happens later in the fall and winter, after enough precipitation has been received to prevent fire spread. This year the early arrival of plentiful amounts of precipitation precluded prescribed burning in the fall, so firefighters turned their focus to pile burning.  Siskiyou County residents and visitors may notice smoke from these projects in the coming weeks. If smoke is encountered on a roadway, please reduce your speed, turn on headlights, and watch out for any fire personnel or apparatus.   The following is a list of pile burning projects that are planned for each ranger district on the Klamath National Forest. Visit the 'News' section on this page for additional information on planned units and active operations.  Scott-Salmon River Ranger District:Just over one thousand acres of pile burning are planned across the district.

2,181 acres are within the Craggy Project northwest of Yreka. 2,019 acres of pile burning will occur in the Horse Creek, Doggett Creek, and Round Mountain areas. Further to the west, Happy Camp fire crews will be focusing on nearly 9,500 acres of pile burning. Pile units are located primarily in two areas: between the community of Happy Camp and Huckleberry Mountain, and between Seiad and Lake Mountain. Goosenest Ranger District:
Fire crews will burn 300 acres of hand piles in the Black Rock Fire Management Zone as part of a shaded fuel break. This project is near Shovel Creek Meadow, north of Willow Creek Mountain. In the Butte Mountain area, north of Martin's Dairy, 20 acres of machine piles are planned for burning. Miscellaneous piles are located across the rest of the district, including the Veteran's Memorial, various administrative sites like campground and other facilities, and roadside piles near Bray.

Residents and visitors to the area can expect to see and smell moderate-to-heavy amounts of smoke during the seven-day prescribed burn operation.During the day, smoke will impact the 512 Road, the OW Ranch, Forest Lakes, Canyon Creek Fish Hatchery and Pleasant Valley. In the evening hours, smoke will impact the 512 Road and Pleasant Valley, as smoke will likely move down Cherry Creek.To minimize the impact of smoke, fire personnel will terminate ignitions by 3 p.m. and signs will be posted on roads that are likely to be affected by smoke. Motorists are urged to slow down and use caution while driving through these areas for the safety of firefighters, themselves and the public. Residual smoke may linger in these areas through Friday, Dec. 10.“The Tonto National Forest appreciates the ongoing patience and support of the communities that surround the forest as our fire specialists work to reduce the risk of wildfires through prescribed burning operations,” said District Ranger Matt Paciorek. “These treatments support the forest’s landscape-scale fuels reduction strategy to reduce catastrophic wildfire danger, initiate restoration of natural ecological systems and to develop and foster sustainable forest conditions for wildlife habitat and watersheds.”Broadcast fire treatments typically continue for several days and are conducted when fuel moisture content and weather conditions are favorable. Low-to-moderate winds are needed to carry flames and to dissipate smoke during and after firing operations and to achieve safe and beneficial effects sought by land managers.  The Forest Service conducts broadcast burns to reduce the build-up of hazardous fuel loads such as leaf litter, grasses and shrubs to prevent the risk of catastrophic wildfires.For more information contact the Payson Ranger Station at (928) 474-7900 or for news and information about the Tonto National Forest, follow us on Facebook @TontoNationalForest or Twitter @TontoForest.

Huron-Manistee NFs '22 Winter Rx Burning,"


Huron-Manistee National Forests 2022 Winter Prescribed Fire
This winter, fire personnel on the Huron-Manistee National Forests will be engaged in prescribed under burning and pile burning treatment of forest vegetation. In order to meet future challenges in the most effective way possible, the Forests will continue to use prescribed burning as a tool in our mission to reduce the build-up of hazardous fuels, restore forest ecosystems, and improve the resiliency and safety of communities within the wildland urban interface.
All prescribed fire projects will be conducted in accordance with an approved burn plan. Burn plans describe the specific conditions under which burns must be conducted including the weather, number of personnel, and opportunities to minimize smoke impacts. Some of our planned projects include burning piles of stacked materials and low to moderate intensity understory burns of vegetation on the forest floor. The main goals of these projects are to reduce the severity of future wildfires and provide added protection for communities in the wildland urban interface. In addition, the burns will promote a diverse and more resilient forest and improve habitat for wildlife. The actual dates of ignition will depend on local weather and fuel conditions. Prescribed fire treatments have been found to be successful in reducing flame lengths during subsequent wildfire events, providing increased opportunities for suppression operations. These effects make prescribed fire particularly useful as a treatment around communities and other values within the wildland.  
Visitors are asked to avoid areas where prescribed burns are being conducted. Some spur roads near the burn areas may be inaccessible during operations. As a result of the burns, some residents and visitors may see or smell smoke. They may also witness glowing from the fires at night. The fires will be carefully monitored. Local authorities will be notified prior to burn days and kept informed throughout burning operations. Please visit the News section on this page for additional information on planned units and active operations.

 Management Area 14/F4/F2 – 16 acresProposed burning dates: 11/10/2021 – 4/10/2022 
 Nearby residents can expect some lingering smoke effects overnight after the burns and may see some moderate to heavy smoke impacts for short periods during ignition operations. These effects will be mitigated by burning on days with good ventilation so that smoke will be dispersed away from communities.   More information will be published as weather conditions allow for safe burning operations.
