In the 35 years that Mike Lester has worked as a forester, nothing compares to the East Troublesome fire's behavior last week. Its 105,000-acre jump from Wednesday night into Thursday alone would classify as the fifth-largest wildfire in recorded state history; the fire as a whole is now the second-largest.
""I've never heard of something going quite this fast,"" said Lester, the state forester and director of the Colorado State Forest Service.
This year's wildfireseason, Lester says, is raising literal and metaphorical red flags that forests in Colorado and across the American West might be unhealthy.
But to understand why 2020 has been the worst fire season on record, ithelps to have a crash course in fire ecology and its history.
MORE: Five charts that show 2020 ranks in Colorado wildfire history
Some of the main factors that determine a fire's intensity and size are wind, temperature, humidity and fuel moisture. Colorado has experienced significant drought this year, drying out vegetation and seeing no precipitation as relief. When the Cameron Peak fire, the largest fire in Colorado's recorded history, made a 30,000-acre run two weeks ago, assisted by high winds, Larimer and Grand counties were in ""severe"" or ""extreme"" drought. And during last week's run by the East Troublesome fire, some areas of Grand County have been classified in ""exceptional"" drought.
The type of fuel also matters, but Lester noted that stands of dead trees -- including those killed by pine or spruce beetles -- don't necessarily make a fire worse; they just make it less predictable. The density of a forest makes a greater difference, with fire spreading more easily in highly dense forests.
Right now, most of Colorado's forests are incredibly dense. When the U.S. Forest Service enacted early 20th century fire suppression policies -- often known as the ""10 o'clock rule,"" where any forest fire was expected to be put out as soon as possible -- there were no accompanying policies to manually thin and manage forested lands.
MORE: Huge western fires in 1910 changed U.S. wildfire policy. Will today's conflagrations do the same?
But fire has always been a natural part of Colorado's ecosystem, albeit to varying degrees based on elevation. Lower elevations are historically used to low-grade fires as often as every few years, while high alpine forests would get intense, stand-clearing blazes every 150-300 years, and midgrade elevations would get moderate fires every 50 to 100 years.
Historically, wildfires in Colorado were almost always sparked by lightning, but that doesn't mean
human-caused fires have always been bad. In fact, native tribes regularly lit fires to keep the land healthy and refreshed. Each tribe had its own reason for burning the land, according to research from Utah State University, but many found ithelpful for hunting, farming and even intertribal conflict. When they were pushed out as white settlers moved westward across the continent, their burning habits disappeared as well.
In the century or so since the ""10 o'clock"" mentality, forests have grown increasingly dense with both live and dead vegetation. And while the mindset around fire management has changed to acknowledge fire's beneficial role on the landscape, not enough resources have been allocated to adequately restore forests to where they should be, according to Lester. Suppressing fire means more than just building up extra vegetation as fuel for an inevitable burn; plants end up competing more for resources, making the living ones more vulnerable when a fire does roll through.
All of this is occurring in the context of climate change, which is leading to warmer years, longer fire seasons, and often drier weather patterns.
In other words, we've teed up 2020 for a long time
""We have known and predicted for years that we were going to have some big fires like this, it just was a matter of all those factors put together,"" Lester said.
There are certainly some unique elements of this year's fires . The East Troublesome fire, which grew by a factor of six from Wednesday night to Thursday morning, jumped over the Continental Divide through a handful of spot fires . Many were flabbergasted that a fire would fly above treeline from one forest to another.
But incident commander Noel Livingston said in a briefing Friday morning that it's not unheard of for a fire to jump over mountains. And given high winds that carried embers and thick smoke for miles, even past treeless tundra, it makes sense that spot fires lit up once the wind reached lower, more vegetated elevations.
""We were hoping that wouldn't occur,"" Livingston said. But, he added, ""How often that happens across the Rockies, I can't say.""
Another potential factor affecting this year's fire season: the coronavirus pandemic. As many public spaces and attractions have been closed to the public, or limited in their capacity, people have been flocking to the outdoors to get out of the house.
Bridget Kochel, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, said that the department is still trying to quantify this year's visitation numbers especially compared to other years. And because park rangers often give verbal warnings for people violating fire bans, any statistics on the number of violations could be undercounts.
Investigations into the cause of some of this year's biggest wildfires are still ongoing. On the whole, though, humans caused around 85% of all wildfires from 2000 to 2017. Sometimes wildfires start from unattended campfires or even arson, but other times it's from a stray cigarette butt, a poorly maintained car, or sparks thrown from welding operations.
OK, so 2020 is bad. How do we make future years better?
Unfortunately, there's no quick fix. Lester, the state forester, pointed to an upcoming report from the CSFS that will highlight the predicted cost of restoring forests to a healthier state. Given the price tag -- and pandemic-related economic downturn -- as well as the forestry industry's limited workforce, it's going to take a long time to make a sizable change.
""If we want to keep this state healthy from a forest standpoint and healthy from a population standpoint, we really do need to invest in the health of our forests going forward, and it is not going to be inexpensive,"" Lester said. But, he also added, ""fighting fires , that is not inexpensive at all.""

It's more complicated than just performing prescribed burns on as many forests as possible. Prescribed burns are certainly one of the strategies that foresters use, though they are severely limited by weather conditions that give foresters control over the fire. Even before they lay down the first flame, teams have to go in and manually remove excess fuel loads such as dead and downed trees. Otherwise, the density of the forest will result in high-intensity fires that harm the land more than they heal it.
Additionally, communities and even the state at large need to have discussions on what values they want to focus on most, Lester says. Often that means protecting water supply drainages and systems, which can become polluted when high-intensity fires shed mass amounts of ash. It also usually means protecting towns and even individual houses.
""We could evacuate Colorado, but I don't think that's the solution any of us are going to go for,"" Lester said. ""I certainly am not.""
Colorado's natural lands draw thousands of people to the state every year, whether for tourism or residence. And now half the state's population lives in the wildland-urban interface, often called the WUI, where human development and wilderness collide. Continuing the status quo of how forests are currently managed, Lester says, is just not an option anymore.
""The firefighters out there do a damn good job, and they have my utmost appreciation,"" Lester said, ""but we're giving them an impossible task.""

Early on the morning of Oct. 23, Mike Lewelling stood at the Forest Canyon Overlook on Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park and stared 2,500 feet down into whathe called a cauldron of fire and swirling wood smoke.
The East Troublesome fire had Lewelling, the park's fire management officer for 15 years, and his colleagues more than a bit panicked that fall Friday. But after decades of training and preparation, they like to think of it as productive panic.
On Oct. 21, East Troublesome had run 18 miles in 90 minutes on the furious wings of 100-mph winds, jumping the Continental Divide at Sprague Mountain. Superheated chunks of pine cone and lodgepole pine boughs leapfrogged the high alpine tundra from the Grand Lake side to the east, in 1.5-mile surges that stunned every fire manager.
Two days later, as Lewelling was mesmerized by the cauldron below, the even more massive Cameron Peak fire was squeezing the park from the northwest. The two fires created a dire pincer, pushing flames downhill in any of five different drainages pointing straight at the sprawling tourist mecca of Estes Park.
He knew the next few hours would be crucial for saving the park, visited by 4.6 million people a year, and the town, home to 6,000 residents and tens of thousands of tourists at any given time. Buthe also knew everyone in Larimer County now had to rely on fire mitigation work that began 20 years before. And when the fire was out -- if East Troublesome could be put out -- Colorado would need the expertise of colleagues like Koren Nydick and Doug Parker for the next 20 years to preserve Rocky Mountain National Park's legacy.
The story those three park managers told last week describes how precise planning, dumb weather luck, backbreaking preparation and nimble adaptation are combining to save the park's 415 square miles from the ravages of two 2020 wildfires.
One of Lewelling's favorite sayings is, ""Hope is not a good plan."" One of his other favorite sayings is, ""Chance favors the prepared.""
On Oct. 23, the park was the proving ground for his aphorisms.
Burnouts, lucky ridgelines and magical fog
When East Troublesome skipped over the park's famous high tundra, it grew in disease-ridden lodgepole and spruce in Forest and Spruce canyons. T emperatures have risen for decades in the park and soils have dried out. Mountain pine beetles survive milder winters and attack lodgepole, and spruce beetles turn majestic spruce into matchsticks.
Lewelling and his team, which includes the full-time Alpine Hotshots firefighting crew, firstheard of
the fire racing around Grand Lake and jumping the divide at a midnight briefing. Lewelling took a call from the National Weather Service at 5 a.m. on Oct. 22, telling him their satellites were detecting hot spots in Spruce Canyon.
Spruce Canyon runs in a line downhill into the Big T hompson River, feeding the fire across popular Fern Lake and Cub Lake, into Moraine Park and on to the hundreds of tinder-dry wood buildings at YMCA of the Rockies. From there, wildfire could roll over restaurants, RV parks, resorts, and T -shirt and rock shops, straight into Estes Park.
The Estes Valley, with the views that enthusiasts in the early 1900s likened to Switzerland, has five major drainages, Lewelling said. All five funnel into town.
All of Estes Park was ordered evacuated on Oct. 22. That morning, a fog bank crept uphill from Longmont, a cooling cloud the ever-practical Lewelling does nothesitate to call miraculous. The fog mixed with smoke to lend evacuation scenes an apocalyptic red glow. But it also put a wet blanket on fire fuel and coated pine needles in a light dusting of ice at higher elevations in the park.
The pause gave Lewelling time to organize the hotshots and hundreds of other personnel from dozens of agencies. They prioritized targets with managers of the Cameron Peak fire. That blaze had started well to the west in August, burned into isolated areas of the park, then roared into Colorado's largest wildfire in history by Oct. 14. By late October it was riding the same dry winds that drove East Troublesome, and had wrapped around to the east to threaten Glen Haven north of Estes Park.
So on Oct. 23, Lewelling drove to 11,500 feet. The winds were rocking his car, and when he emerged at the overlook, a gust ripped the door from his hands.
Topographically, it was as if he were standing at the top of a chute. Park headquarters, the YMCA, and Estes Park were all at the bottom. The fire had multiple attractive routes to get downhill fast: Moraine Park, Beaver Meadows, Glacier Gorge, Old Fall River Road.
""On that morning, I was absolutely certain we'd see Estes Park burn,"" he said.
Bear Lake Road and Beaver Meadows had to be the firebreak.
That hope had all been mapped out long before. Lewelling last week rolled open an overlay map showing the red outline of East Troublesome's path east across the park, and a yellow outline of all the fire-fuel clearing that crews have done over decades.
""We've been fighting this fire for 20 years,"" Lewelling said.
He calls the yellow zones the ""catcher's mitt."" For years, every cutting crew he could contract cleared beetle-killed trunks and the lowest 10 feet of living ponderosa pine branches. They stacked them in slash piles the size of semi-trailers on the moraine slopes, and burned them when surrounded by winter snow.
A Master Fuels Plan developed years ago is their guide and logbook. It explains why ponderosa
trunks near the Bear Lake turnoff are blackened eight to 10 feet off the ground, from a prescribed burn in 2019. The ponderosa's thick bark keeps low-intensity fires from killing the tree, while the flames take care of the low, dead branches.
A prescribed burn north of Upper Beaver Meadows Road in 2009 was meant to protect Deer Mountain, the last hump before downtown Estes Park, from fires like the East Troublesome. On Oct. 23, as firefighting crews scrambled to stamp out hot spots, it did.
Fat fingers of burn came over Mount Wuh, down past Fern Lake, along the edge of the Moraine Park riding stables and park campground, and onto Beaver Mountain. A big burn scar from the 2012 Fern Lake wildfire, still healing, slowed the 2021 inferno.
Fifty-mile-per-hour winds drove sparks far ahead. A glacier-carved ridgeline in exactly the right spot on the northeast flank of Beaver Mountain proved another useful barrier. The burn area runs through ponderosa on the south side of the ridge, then stops like a knife's edge at the wetter, denser lodgepole on the north side of the ridge.
A culvert under Upper Beaver Meadows Road nearly shredded the catcher's mitt concept. It had become clogged over the years with tumbleweeds, and licks of flame blew through the steel tunnel beneath the road, toward Deer Mountain. Firefighters hung out under trees thinned in the 2009 prescribed burn and used drip torches to light backburns, robbing the advancing flames of any remaining fuel.
On the south side of Beaver Mountain, fire was trickling down alongside the Big T hompson and into Moraine Park meadow. In summer, ribbons of side streams sodden the ground. But this was late October, and dry grasses folded crisply under fire-driven winds. Lewelling put fire rigs and crews at Bear Lake Road bridge to protect the YMCA, though he didn't know exactly how they would.
Fire managers also made the painful decision to use heavy machinery to cut a fire line across the eastern tip of Beaver Meadows, within sight of park headquarters. They still flinch when they describe this. T earing up nationally significant ground is not what rangers are about. There is no national parks uniform patch celebrating bulldozers. The park superintendent made the final call herself.
On the night of Oct. 23, a foot and a half of snow started to fall east of the divide. Another moment when ""chance"" met ""prepared.""
In 2016, a fire in T ennessee's Great Smoky Mountains National Park ran out into nearby towns, eventually killing 14 people. Lewelling and the Estes Park fire chief studied that fire and war-gamed similar scenarios for Colorado. Their models showed wildfires ""running right through Estes Park,"" Lewelling said. They invited local officials to a workshop, which they called ""Preparing for T hings We've Never Seen Before.""
""We need to think bigger,"" Lewelling said last week, standing in Beaver Meadows. ""And more extreme.""
Also, he added, ""We could use more aspen."" That's when he introduced Koren Nydick, Rocky Mountain National Park's chief of resource stewardship.
Moose fences and affordable housing for beavers
A chief of resource stewardship at a national park is the defender of flora, fauna and artifacts. Nydick is the one who cringed hardest when the bulldozers came out. She won't even insult weeds by calling them ""invasive."" She prefers ""exotic.""
Nydick is also looking for more aspen in the eastern, ""catcher's mitt"" end of the park. Aspen groves and willows hold more moisture than lodgepole, and protect soggy ground at their feet. The wetter wood and ground resist fire.
Natural fires throughout history have replaced pine with faster-growing, opportunistic aspen. But constantly putting out rejuvenating fires inside the park has narrowed biodiversity beyond even a steward's appreciation. Another phrase for this kind of long-term firefighting through restoring diversity is creating a ""patchwork.""
Elk and moose also like willow and aspen. They like them inside their stomachs.
So if Nydick's crews are going to encourage new groves for biodiversity and firebreaks, they also have to put fences around them. Moraine Park is now ringed with islands of fenced willow and budding aspen. The elk that tourists love to Instagram have relentlessly mowed down everything else.
Beavers also love aspen, with the paradoxical advantage that they can also create aspen. When they cut down trees -- like aspen -- and build dams, the pools back up to soak ground that grows more aspen.
But while metro-area beavers get so busy that urban wildlife watchers have considered birth control, beavers apparently find Moraine Park too dry for settlement. Nydick and colleagues are trying affordable beaver housing in other drainages, using plywood or clumps of branches. If their social engineering proves successful, they'll try it in Moraine Park.
Nydick had evacuated her family from Estes Park to Fort Collins on Thursday, Oct. 22, heeding the warnings from Lewelling and others. Then she went back to work at Beaver Meadows, where the Visitors Center became a mustering area for park employees not directly on the fire lines.
She and her team advised helicopter crews on which high country lakes they could safely dip buckets for fire suppression runs. They coached hotshots to avoid back-burning slash piles atop sensitive swaths of wildflowers that would be sterilized by high heat. They asked cleanup crews to leave burned-out snags standing if they looked like good critter habitat.
As Lewelling's Beaver Meadows defense intensified on Oct. 23, Nydick watched Park Superintendent Darla Sidles give the nod to the bulldozers. Nydick immediately started planning for grass and wildflower seeds she could scatter in spring along the fireline scar, which in high and dry conditions might be visible for a decade.
She also studied the maps and the weather conditions. Wildfire speeds that can be terrifying to those who need to evacuate a town can be reassuring to wildlife biologists. Fire that sits still and bakes the soil turns biodiversity to white ash. Fire in more of a hurry leaves behind black scars, yes, but also intact root balls just underneath and enzymes that can launch regrowth the next spring.
The overlay maps produced by Nydick's department show ""Soil Burn Severity"" from both East Troublesome and Cameron Peak, colored from cool green to bright red. Last week, Nydick stood on blackened lower slopes of Green Mountain, on the park's western side near Grand Lake. The soil was pitch black, but the colors on the map she held were mostly green and yellow, for low to moderate severity.
Nydick was surrounded by swaying, jet-black sticks of burned-over lodgepole. On a 90-degree day, they smelled like they were still smoldering. Though it was declared contained on Nov. 30, East Troublesome has never officially been declared ""out,"" Lewelling said. Satellites and work crews still keep a watchful eye for potential flare ups.
Make more coverage of Colorado's environment possible by becoming a Colorado Sun member, starting at just $5 a month.
Nydick took out a garden trowel and poked into the black. White ash means it's hopeless, she said. This, she added, she could work with. Nydick immediately pulled out a clump of surviving lupine root, and then pointed to a green lupine shoot already straining upward in the June sun.
Lewelling, standing nearby, shook his head at the sight of dozens of lodgepoles, not fallen over, not standing burnt in place, but arched over in perfect curves. The forest managers' theory is that extreme heat loosened the fibers inside the trunks while the 100 mph winds bent them over, like a candlestick in a heat wave.
He has worked in national parks across the country for 30 years. Pointing to the eerie tree arches still genuflecting to the power of the wildfire, he said, ""I've never seen anything like this.""
On the hillside dense with fallen lodgepole, Nydick said the burned trunks will stay in place. Partly because they are in official wilderness, as much of the park has been designated, and therefore can't be touched by mechanized skidders. But also because the fallen trunks keep serving a purpose in the face of potential mass erosion.
""They're keeping the hillside on the hillside,"" she said.
Nydick is asked whether the combination of heavy black and budding green makes her feel optimistic or pessimistic.
She pauses. ""I have a mix of emotions,"" Nydick finally said. ""This is a lodgepole forest . This is what lodgepole forests do, for thousands of years.""
She pauses again, then says, ""I do feel kind of sorry for Doug.""
A moment for mourning, an opening for reinvention
Doug Parker is trails program supervisor for Rocky Mountain Park, standing 20 feet up a trail he and his crew rebuilt from scratch just two years ago that is now a tangle of hand-cut steps turned to charcoal.
He is, in fact, pretty depressed.
""I had a couple moments this winter,"" Parker mumbled.
It's hard for Parker to let go of the fact thathe stood on this same spot on Oct. 20, the day before East Troublesome turned into a blazing derecho. He'd been hiking the Green Mountain trails to check recent work. The fire was 18 miles away. He smelled a little smoke. It was a good day.
By Oct. 23, the worst of the fire had passed over the divide to the east, and west side fire crews were putting out spot fires and assessing the damage to hundreds of homes around Grand Lake. Smoke was clearing to reveal the rubble of park losses on the west side, too.
When the fire hit Grand Lake on Oct. 21, park employees housed in aging lodges and cabins near the Kawuneeche entrance had 8 minutes' warning to leave. They fled east over Trail Ridge Road -- a narrow, sheer-drop nightmare on a good day -- with burning lodgepoles tipping onto their cars as they tore out.
Their rustic tinderbox sleeping quarters melted to the ground. Only their fieldstone fireplaces are still standing. Onahu Lodge was a favorite bunk for Parker's crews, who could crack open a frosty beverage on the porch after a brutal day scraping trails, gazing across the Colorado River at the Never Summer Range.
The visitors' entrance station crumpled in on itself.
Then the fire raced up Parker's meticulously and painfully constructed trails.
Between the dual assaults by the East Troublesome and Cameron Peak fires , Rocky Mountain lost 17 hiking bridges and 31 miles of trails, 15% of all its paths. Each of those paths is the only way to safely access enormous sections of the park, and large areas will be closed to visitors for what could be years until Parker's crews sort it all out. More than 40 of the park's 270 coveted backcountry camping spots will be off limits this summer.
Up and down Green Mountain, for just one example, carefully placed anti-erosion logs burned off, leaving only charred 12-inch bolts thrusting uselessly into the thin air. Parker points to carefully placed boulders used as trail boundaries that cracked and flaked in the heat of the fire. On the Fern and Cub lakes side of the park, 10,000 to 20,000 people a month hiked trails that are now closed.
For those who do plan to hike on the burned trails already reopening, Parker has some advice.
""It will look very different. It's also very hot. Bring chapstick. Be ready to get dirty,"" he said. ""It's your opportunity to look like a wildland firefighter.""
This summer, Parker oversees crews whose ranks have now ballooned to 94 trail cutters. Managers are drawing on the Youth Conservation Corps and teams loaned by other national parks. They won't fell every burned tree, instead striving to create a safety ""box"" over the trails that's 6-feet wide and 12-feet high.
In many of the burned-out spots, trail crews will be parched by temperatures 10 to 15 degrees warmer than normal. Their previous shade was destroyed by East Troublesome.
Those bridges, though. The bridges really bother Parker. One lost in the Cameron Peak section was a 35-foot multi-use beauty called the Corral Creek Trailhead Bridge. T hinking of it while on the Green Mountain trail, Parker shakes off the bad thoughts and focuses on the present. Park maintenance crews have already rebuilt the span and dropped it in place with a helicopter.
One thing he likes about the new bridges is that the railings are made from the trunks of trees felled inside the park because they were leaning over picnic areas or blocking a road.
On his better days, Parker focuses on the chance to rethink where trails should run and how they can best serve the public and the wildlife. Whole mountainsides will be sliding around in post-fire rains and snow. Contours will change. Trails could avoid burned areas or go through them on purpose as an educational exercise. They can shape the park experience for decades. Park officials are encouraging creativity.
Rock and mudslides can be grim, he said. But they have also created thrilling waterfalls in new places.
""It's rejuvenating,"" Parker says, gazing at a few green ferns climbing up a charred trunk. ""You gotta keep that in the back of your mind.""

416_Fire_turned_out_to_be_a_healthy_burn_for_the__Journal_The_Cortez_Dolores_Mancos_CO___August_28_2020.txt,"416 Fire turne d o ut to be a he althy burn fo r the - Jo urnal, The (Co rte z, Do lo re s, Manco s, CO ) - August 28, 20 20
Aug ust 28, 2020  Journal, The (Cortez, Dolores, Mancos, CO)  Jonathan Romeo; Herald staff writer
As more research is done within the 416 Fire burn scar, it's becoming increasingly clear the blaze that burned in summer 2018 was a healthy fire for the landscape, which is already showing strong signs of recovery.
""It's exciting to see a fire in the contemporary era behave as we'd except,"" said Michael Remke, a foresthealth research associate with Mountain Studies Institute. ""It's not like the fires we're seeing burn in California.""
The 416 Fire broke out June 1, 2018, during a time of extreme drought in Southwest Colorado, and went on to burn an estimated 54,000 acres, mostly in the Hermosa Creek watershed in the San Juan National Forest .
Initially, estimates showed the 416 Fire burned more acres at a higher intensity, raising concern from forest researchers about the prospect of vegetation recovering within the burn scar.
While not completely unnatural, high-intensity burns were historically less common and are considered to occur more frequently in recent years, in part because of a longstanding practice to suppress wildfires and the drying out of the landscape associated with climate change.

But as more studies were completed on the 416 Fire, it became clear the blaze did not burn soils as intensely as initially thought.
A follow-up assessment of the burn scar in November 2018 found only about 3% of the fire burned at a high intensity, while 30% burned at moderate intensity and 54% burned at low intensity. About 13% of the burn area is considered ""unburned.""
""You just don't have extensive areas of cooked, scorched land,"" Jonina Vanderbilt, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service, said at the time. ""It really is a mosaic burn when you look at the map, and that's really good news.""
Satellite imageryMore recently, a study that looked beyond just soil damage and took into account vegetation, such as the tree canopy and shrubs, found much of the same.
Seth Bogle, a remote-sensing analyst who works as a contractor for the Forest Service, said the Monitoring T rends in Burn Severity program tracks fire recovery by taking satellite images before
and after fires.
""We look at an image after the first growing season, then look at an image before the fire, and determine where was the largest change,"" he said.
The MT SB program this summer released results for the 416 Fire, which shows satellite imagery taken in September 2019, more than a year after the fire, compared with imagery taken in September 2017.

Jerry McBride/Durango Herald
In all, the MT SB survey found the 416 Fire burned at about 6% high intensity, 25% moderate and about 50% low. About 20% of the area was found unburned.
""Most people were concerned it was an uncharacteristically severe fire,"" said William Baker, a Durango resident and an emeritus professor at the University of Wyoming who studies fires.
""But (this study) suggests this was not an unusually severe fire. It was within the range of fires that have occurred historically and is probably at the low end of most fires that have occurred in this sort of landscape.""
Indeed, groundwork within the 416 Fire burn scar corroborates the studies.
Vegetation returnsFire ecologist and Fort Lewis College professor Julie Korb said monitoring research has found productive revegetation on the burn scar, with Gambel oak, shrubs and select bushes returning fast.
Korb's students this summer set up their own research projects to look at how certain plants respond to fire , as well as how wildlife such as deer and elk are now using the landscape after the fire.
""We're seeing really good, healthy generation,"" Korb said.
Mountain Studies Institute has also been leading long-term research plots, Remke said.
The most obvious trend researchers see, he said, was that the 416 Fire had minimal burning into tree canopies. With about 70% of trees still green, that means they are likely to survive and produce seeds for future regeneration.
""That really shows us the 416 Fire is not out of line from historical fires in these landscapes,"" he said.

Jerry McBride/Durango Herald
It's not all good news: Rapid Gambel oak spread could slow tree regeneration. And on steeper slopes, like along T ripp Creek, vegetation was scorched, leading to flooding that has previously killed fish and caused property damage.
The firefighting effort in 2018 cost an estimated $40 million and lasted weeks to keep the fire from destroying homes and private property.
But for the most part, the 416 Fire was healthy burn, Remke said.
Bud made a differenceThe main reason why a fire that broke out during an historic drought was able to benefit the forest , he said, was because a tropical wave off the west coast of Africa, which traveled westward into the Pacific Ocean and north along the west coast of Mexico, turned into a strong storm system that made landfall June 15.
Hurricane Bud arrived two weeks after the fire sparked and put some much needed moisture on the ground, slowing the fire's spread and allowing firefighters to make serious gains on containment.
""The drought was so bad, it's easy to forget that significant rainstorm,"" Remke said. ""That moisture really helped make the fire what it was. It's really remarkable.""
Korb added that a strong 2018-19 winter season for snowpack also aided in allowing for vegetation to reappear.
""A lot of that moisture allowed the understory to regenerate,"" she said.
Korb said four factors play into forest recovery: burn severity during the fire; the type of vegetation that burns; precipitation that arrives; and the slope of the hillsides.
For the 416 Fire, these factors worked out, unlike for the Missionary Ridge Fire in 2002. By comparison, about 30% of the 70,000 acres burned in the Missionary Ridge Fire burned at a high intensity.
Baker said continued studies on fires in the region are important, especially as more blazes burn year over year, because not all fires are catastrophic or bad for the landscape.
""We're seeing an awful lot of fires across the West,"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean we're going to see the same trends here locally in the San Juan region. It's very important we look at what's occurring here.""

A moderately dry year could spell an early onset for fire season in the Southwest, but homeowners can act now to harden their properties against wildfire.
Even though the pandemic declared over COVID-19 has altered operations at the West Region Wildfire Council, its site assessment and cost-share programs remain available.
Assessments entail council staff assessing properties for wildfire risk and developing specific recommendations to reduce the risk. The cost-share program provides technical assistance with reducing the risks; landowners pay the full cost and will be partially reimbursed.
The council also operates a community wood-chipping program for eligible communities.
""With the site visits, we are treating those considerably differently than we have in the past,"" WRWC Executive Director Jamie Gomez said Friday.
""We are still trying to do them, but certainly, with COVID-19 going on, we're having to observe all the county-level and state-level public health orders and guidelines.""
In most of WRWC's service area, the visits will entail mask-use and social distancing.
In Gunnison County, which has restricted non-residents from visiting, site visits are for now precluded. The wildfire council will continue taking requests from Gunnison County property owners and schedule the visits for a time after the restrictions have been lifted.
The council is also setting up a mobile application that staff can use to record findings from on-site assessments and then share the information with homeowners.
""We'll be able to do site visits without the homeowner present, if needs warrant it. We can make that accommodation available as well. We are trying to make wildfire mitigation continue to be a priority for residents and communities in this area and, as best we can, make our services available,"" Gomez said.
Naturally occurring fires can threaten homes and structures that are near wildlands. An estimated 3 million Coloradans live in such areas, referred to as the wildland-urban interface, or WUI.
Saturday marked Wildfire Preparedness Day, kicking off Wildfire Awareness Month for May. Although the WRWC had to cancel prep day events, the month serves as a good time to take action to harden properties against wildfires.
""Every homeowner should be aware of their wildfire risk and the associated responsibility to reduce that risk, not only to protect their property, but also to improve the safety of first responders,"" said Colorado State Forest Service (CSFS) Wildfire Mitigation Specialist Daniel Beveridge, in a joint news
release from his agency, Rocky Mountain Insurance Association, the Colorado Association of Realtors and Colorado Project Wildfire.
""There are numerous examples from the past few seasons showing that proactive wildfire mitigation efforts are effective and now is a perfect time for people across the state to take action.""
Creating defensible space within 30 feet of homes is an important risk-reduction step. Gomez said many structures catch fire because flying embers from wildfires, or torching from trees, land on combustible materials such as dead leaves in gutters, firewood stacked on porches, and wooden decks.
""This is a great time of year to do some outdoor maintenance to reduce fuels,"" Gomez said, also recommending that homeowners cut back and remove dead and dried grasses.
More information about the WRWC's programs and COVID-19 response can be found at cowildfire.org. The site is being updated, but is still a good clearinghouse for information.

The extraordinary wildfireseason of 2021 brought the need for updated equipment into sharp focus for the Allenspark Fire Department. With 32 volunteer firefighters, communication is key. Old radios put them at a disadvantage.
""We have so many physical blocks,"" volunteer firefighter Johnathon Oppermann explained. ""There are trees and changes in elevation and hills and valleys. It's difficult sometimes to get clear communication through and sometime to get any communication.""
The Allenspark community heard the clarion call of the fire department. In four short months, the Area Club raised almost $90,000 to buy 32 brand new digital radios which will help the firefighters immensely.
""Our tagline was, 'A radio for a hero,'"" said Tamara Durstine who headed up the fundraising effort. ""Most people would go to homeowner and say they saved your house. My strategy was this is about the firefighters being safe. It's all about them getting home safe at night after protecting our homes. We can evacuate. They ran toward the fire. We ran away from the fire.""
New Allenspark Fire Department Chief Mike Cousineau is amazed by the outpouring of financial support from the community.
""These radios give us a lot of capabilities,"" Couseineau said. ""When we have federal fires, we have to change channels constantly. Now out firefighters can do that easily in the field. In the past, we've just been buying used radios. They are already old. They start dropping like flies in the first year we have them. We always wanted new ones.""
The digital radios purchased by the department are also water and fire resistant. Looking back on the 2020 wildfires in Northern Colorado, Oppermann remembered the overwhelming
feeling of trepidation.
""It was really scary to know that all of the areas that were burning were so close to us,"" he remembered.
""We had the Lefthand Fire, the Calwood Fire, the East Troublesome Fire and the Cameron Peak Fire. My involvement was on the Calwood Fire and also the East Troublesome Fire the days that it jumped the Continental Divide. It was terrifying. We sat doing lookout atop a hill just watching flames at about 1 o'clock in the morning light up the night sky. We knew that cold weather was coming. We just sat there and prayed that we wouldn't see the fire advance further before the weather would come in and give us some assistance.""
With the success of the recent fundraising effort by the Area Club, the department has now asked for
another $30,000 to help fund necessary maintenance, batteries and insurance.
""We wouldn't put our own children or wives or husbands out there without good equipment,"" Durstine
commented. ""They have to have good equipment. It's their lives.""
On Sunday, May 23, the Allenspark Fire Departmentheld an open house to thank the community and to thank Leo Touzjian who is stepping away from his role has chief after six years. He was presented with a golden firefighting axe.
The Allenspark Fire Protection District covers 160 square miles in rural Larimer and Boulder Counties. The district has mutual aid agreements with neighboring departments including Estes Park, Lyons, Indian Peaks, Lefthand Canyon, Pinewood Springs and the U.S. Forest Service.

A - Analyzing data on the Crystal River near Redstone he calcula.txt,"Analyzing data on the Crystal River near Redstone, he calculated a 5% drop in annual mean streamflow
since 2000, compared with the latter half of the 20th century, but a 10% decline during drier years.
In that same analysis of the Crystal, Lukas found that the average date of peak streamflow had shifted
one week earlier since 2000: from reliably arriving in June to sometimes coming in May. Multiple studies
across the Colorado basin have similarly calculated a one- to four-week earlier runoff.
In addition, an above-average snowpack doesn't mean an equivalent runoff, as this past year has
shown. After a good winter followed by a warm, dry spring and summer, just 55% of the upper
Colorado's runoff made it into Lake Powell.
Earlier peak runoff and lower flows mean less water (especially in drought years) in late summer and
early fall, a critical time for irrigation.
As with higher temperatures, declining streamflows and earlier runoff are certain into the future, but how
much will depend on emissions. In Glenwood Springs, the Roaring Fork's late summer flows could
decline by 30% to 50% by 2070, according to a 2018 analysis by Lukas.
""Changes to water will touch nearly everything,"" he said. ""All the risk is on the dry side.""
The underlying factor
Another important factor to consider is one not readily seen: soil moisture.
One of the metrics used to calculate drought severity, soil moisture has been studied locally by the
Aspen Global Change Institute since 2013. This short period of record may preclude discerning any
trends about whether local soils are getting drier, but the data show how moisture levels can have a
domino effect season to season.
Elise Osenga, community science manager for the institute, likens the soil to a sponge. A dry sponge,
like dry soil, absorbs more water than when it's wet, while a wet sponge, like saturated soil, lets the
excess run off. The water that the soil doesn't absorb goes into streams.
""Climate change is more likely to dry soils in the spring,"" Osenga said.
This year, things may have cooled off since August, but drought conditions have worsened, with all of
Colorado, as of Oct. 22, experiencing some level of drought and 78% of the state in extreme or
exceptional drought. This doesn't bode well for spring.
""What happens in September and October is actually really interesting, because it plays a big role in
determining whether we start the next spring already at risk of a drought versus in better shape,"" Osenga
said.
With multiple dry years over the past two decades, some scientists are wondering if we're entering a
period of megadrought, which hasn't been seen in several hundred years.
No single drought is evidence of climate change, Lukas said, but ""what we're seeing since 2000 is that
climate change is stacking the deck. We're more prone to the deep droughts, the ones that sneak out of
left field like in 2020.""
And even with good planning, that's sure to make water managers in Marble and Carbondale and
throughout the Colorado River basin nervous.
""We do see changing conditions, whether attributable to increased demand/development by water users,
drought or long-term climate change,"" wrote Colorado water commissioner Jake DeWolfe in an email.
""Any of them leads to the same problem: a shortage of water. We are involved in planning for the future
likelihood that we will need to limit, if not curtail, uses in Colorado to meet the needs of downstream
states.""

A - An_unexpected_variable_Experimental_Forest_digs__Sky-Hi_News_Granby_CO___August_21_2020.txt,"n une xp e cte d variable : Exp e rime ntal Fo re st digs - Sky-Hi Ne ws (Granby, CO ) - August 21, 2020
With a wildfire burning roughly five miles from the outdoor research laboratory known as the Fraser Experimental Forest , Site Manager Banning Starr rushed to pack up 80 years of data and historical files Saturday morning.
Established in 1937, the experimental forest is one of just 13 such locations in the country, and the forest is home to some of the most extensive ecological datasets in the nation. The site is currently at risk from the Williams Fork Fire , which has burned over 10,000 acres and is only 3% contained.
""We started moving a lot of the historic files, for example, the papers for the establishment, which are so old they're written on rice paper,"" Starr said. ""Those are invaluable to us.""
Starr had already helped to evacuate people camping and backpacking in the forest as well as ensure the safety of the four other people living at the experimental forestheadquarters, including his wife and son.
Luckily, not too many people were staying at the living quarters of the experimental forest this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Starr said.
""The actual headquarters itself was closed, except for the people who live on site or who had quarantined before they started working for the summer,"" he said. ""So, we were really lucky in that regard that our dormitory wasn't full and we didn't have researchers all over the ground.""
He added thathe was very grateful to all of the people who had reached out to offer to help moving important materials out of the forest or provide storage space.
After the paper files were moved to safety, Starr and fire crews got to work mitigating risk of fire damage to the experiments and historical buildings.
Some expensive and irreplaceable equipment involved in experiments was moved to storage, while other data recording equipment was left to continue collecting information. Starr said if the fire were to burn on experimental forest land, that equipment would be lost and have to be rebuilt.
""Some of those stations will continue to record and they're going to be somewhat sacrificed, so we can keep collecting that data,"" he said. ""The idea would be that once the fire comes through and once the forest is given back to us, we're going to go immediately back to those structures and rebuild them so we have as small of a data gap as possible.""
As for the buildings, fire crews dug ditches into the ground soil around the edges of each building so that the fire won't have fuel and hopefully won't reach the structure. T rees have been trimmed and pruned so that fuels aren't as readily available.
All around the headquarters area, crews also laid hoses in trenches of ground soil that connect to a sprinkler system and nearby water sources. A few pumps send the water to 1,500 gallon collection pools which is then dispersed by the hoses and sprinklers to raise the relative humidity.
Kelly Elder, scientist in charge of the Fraser Experimental Forest , explained that raising the relative humidity in the area, especially wetting the vegetation and the ground, helps keep from fueling the fire.
""If we bring up the relative humidity and the moisture in the ground and the buildings enough, then the flames will move through here without igniting the structures,"" Elder said. ""It turns it into a little tropical island instead of the desert we had.""
The sprinkler system allows fire crews to turn it on and leave unattended for hours in case the area needs to be evacuated. Also in the works is a dozer line in between the forest and the fire, which runs from County Road 73 to Deadhorse Trail.
Elder, who has 25 years of experience in the experimental forest , noted that the mitigation work crews are doing right now will also help keep the area safe in the future from other wildfires.
In the past eight years, Elder can recall at least three wildfires that threatened the experimental forest . He said the hotter, drier and longer summers, along with drier winters, have brought more frequent and intense fires.
""We have to face the fact that climate change is part of the new West and we're going to live with forest fires,"" Elder said.
With the trend of extreme wildfires likely to continue, Elder and Starr emphasized the importance of fire research and noted the potential to study the effects of this blaze could lead to exciting research and finds.
""We don't want fire to come into the experimental forest , but if it does then it might provide us or some scientists an opportunity to study the impacts of that,"" Starr said.

A - Black_Forest_residents_express_concerns_about_new__Gazette_The_Colorado_Springs_CO___April_18_2021.txt,"Black Fo re st re side nts e xp re ss co nce rns abo ut ne w - Gaze tte , The (Colorado Springs, CO ) - Ap ril 18, 2021
April 18, 2021  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Breeanna Jent
A group of residents in Black Forest are worried that the current draft of the new El Paso County Master Plan does not address their concerns about increased density in the forest , which they say would pose higher wildfire hazards and could strain water supply.
Much of Black Forest was identified in the draft plan as a ""large lot residential"" area, one of 12 different place-types that classify specific areas of the county based on their character, scale, form and function.
The ""large lot residential"" place-type ""consists almost entirely of residential development and acts as the transition between 'rural' and 'suburban residential' areas,"" the plan states.
The plan currently suggests a minimum lot size of 2  acres within the forest 's timbered areas, but the Friends of the Black Forest are requesting county planners change the minimum lot size to 5 acres, arguing denser development there presents fire, water and wildlife concerns.
""If you're building two times the density, there's going to be more water demand,"" said T erry Stokka, treasurer of the Friends of the Black Forest . ""Fire danger is very real. That's going to be almost double the traffic, almost double the trees that are cut and almost double the wildlife that's going to be chased away.""
Furthermore, there is already a precedent in Black Forest for 5-acre lots, Stokka said. That guidance was laid out in the Black Forest Preservation Plan, a small area plan created in 1974 to help direct development in the forest . When the El Paso County Master Plan is formally adopted, it will supersede the Black Forest Preservation Plan.
""It's an advisory plan, it's not directive,"" Stokka said. ""But the statement that says in the timbered area lots should be no less than 5 acres per lot, that doesn't sound very advisory to us.""
But El Paso County planning officials said the master plan isn't attempting to change existing zoning .
""The minimum lot size may be 2  acres, but the plan says new development must be compatible with existing development,"" El Paso County Planning and Co mmunit y Development Executive Director Craig Dossey said. ""We aren't saying that we're going to go down to 2 -acre lots all across Black Forest . This plan creates better expectations for those areas.""
But Stokka said compatibility between developments must be better distinguished.
As defined in part by the El Paso County Land Development Code, ""Compatibility does not mean 'the same as.' Rather, compatibility refers to the sensitivity of the proposed use, activity or design in maintaining the character of existing development within the vicinity.""
""Compatibility is only a concept. We're saying we have to have some numbers in here that will say what the rules are. We can't just have concepts,"" Stokka said.
Dossey said compatibility between developments has more to do with how to transition to new development, while zoning laws ""set a firm line on lot sizes.""
""How big a building can be, how tall a building can be, how wide and how deep lots can be, that's more of a discussion of zoning,"" he said.
Stokka said he was concerned that if the new El Paso County Master Plan didn't specify 5-acre lot minimums in Black Forest it would pave the way for denser development there. In the past, he said, the county has sometimes ignored the Black Forest Preservation Plan's guidance for 5-acre lots when approving new developments like Cathedral Pines and Sanctuary in the Pines.
""There are examples where densities were higher, but it's a trade-off because we get bumper areas,"" Dossey said.
One compromise would be more clustered development in Black Forest , Stokka and Dossey said.
Incorporating the concept of ""overall density"" in Black Forest would mean the average parcel size or density is kept at or above a determined threshold, the Black Forest Preservation Plan states. Developers could then ""cluster"" lots or structures on only a portion of the property, leaving more open space. Clustered developments would share utilities like water and wastewater services, depending on the subdivision or area of the county, according to the draft master plan.
""If you encourage conservation design, typically what comes with it are more well thought out covenants"" that restrict ""undesirable"" development, Dossey said.
Clustering ""leaves a lot more open space and undeveloped forest , and that, to us, is good,"" Stokka said.
A second concern among members of the Friends of the Black Forest was that Flying Horse North in northern Colorado Springs was identified in the draft county master plan as an area with ""potential for annexation.""
""This is no more a potential for annexation than any other area, and furthermore, it is over a mile from the nearest city limits,"" Stokka wrote in a March 24 memo sharing the group's input on the plan. He worried if Flying Horse North was annexed it might lead to portions of Black Forest , which is adjacent to the development, being annexed into Colorado Springs.
The county does not control annexation, even with a new intergovernmental agreement recently approved by the county and the City of Colorado Springs meant to help guide growth near the city boundaries and help protect the county's groundwater, Dossey said.
""That designation came from a map provided to us from Colorado Springs,"" he said. ""Far be it for us to say that it's wrong. We want to map similarly. But (annexation is) a decision the property owner and Colorado Springs would have to reach.""
The public comment period on the master plan closed earlier this month, and the Master Plan Advisory Committee could still implement changes to the draft based on community feedback before the county planning commission gives its stamp of approval, Dossey said.
County planners and representatives with design firm Houseal-Lavigne Associates will revise the draft according to the advisory committee's recommendations. The county plans to publish the revised document by April 29, El Paso County Planning and Co mmunit y Development Deputy Director Mark Gebhart told planning commissioners Thursday.
The revised document will be the version the planning commission will consider for approval during two special meetings at 9 a.m. on May 5 and May 26, Gebhart said. There will be opportunities for public comment.

A damage assessment by the Larimer County Assessor's Office found the Cameron Peak Fire resulted in a market loss of more than $6 million.
T hrough an assessment that lasted over 1,200 hours, officials determined that 469 properties were affected by the largest wildfire in the state's history. A total of 243 structures with an assessed value of $472,533 were destroyed, according to the report.
The structures destroyed included 184 single family residences, farm utility buildings, sheds, mobile homes, detached garages, barns, equipment building, a nursery and stable, according to the report.
""This report highlights the significant role the assessor has performing its statutory duties, planning, community collaborating, and damage assessment fieldwork in the county during and after the Cameron Peak Fire or natural disaster,"" Larimer County's assessor Bob Overbeck said.
The fire ignited on Aug. 13 in the Arapahoe and Roosevelt National Forest near Cameron Pass and Chambers Lake. It eventually exploded to 208,913 acres before being contained 112 days later, on Dec. 2.
Under House Bill 14-1001, the state will begin reimbursing affected Larimer County property owners about $123,000 from the lowered property values, according to the report.
Colorado Parks and Wildlife on Thursday reported the fire did not seem to have affected elk herds in the area.
Agency biologist Angelique Curtis conducted an aerial survey of the elk herds for the first time since the fire, locating herds in the Laramie River Valley, Red Feather Lakes and the Cherokee State Wildlife Area.
""The elk that we saw today actually summered up where the Cameron Peak Fire burned in the Comanche Peak Wilderness, Long Draw area and up in Dead Man,"" Curtis said in a news release. ""What we saw today is that the fire didn't inhibit them from actually getting to their wintering ground and we saw some pretty good calf recruitment. ""We did see healthy animals on the ground, so the fire didn't seem to affect them health wise.""
The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

A - City of Durango invites comments on sustainability plan  Ini.txt,"City of Durango invites comments on sustainability plan - Initial survey respondents say 'be more ambitious'

The city of Durango asked residents for feedback about its sustainability goals, and early survey respondents want the city to act faster and be bolder with its goals to give up fossil fuels. The survey, being conducted on the Virtual City Hall webpage until July 31, will help inform the city as it updates its sustainability plan. The city set two major goals in 2019: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase its renewable electricity supply. It is now asking residents to weigh in on the plan, and so far, residents have said the city's goals don't go far enough. ""The survey is just an opportunity for the community to have input on their priorities,"" said Imogen Ainsworth, Durango sustainability coordinator. ""This initial survey is just on high-level goals, and there will be more engagement further down the line with regard to specific action."" In 2019, City Council committed to steering the community's energy usage to more renewable sources. Durango plans to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a 30% reduction by 2030, compared with the city's emissions in 2016. It also plans to have a 100% renewable electricity supply by 2050, with a 50% supply by 2030.  Durango's goals are less ambitious than Colorado goals. Colorado aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50%, compared with 2005 levels, by 2030. By 2050, it aims for a 90% reduction. And the state plans to use 100% renewable energy, not just electricity, by 2040, according to the Colorado Energy Office website.
The term ""energy"" includes transportation and heating systems that are not captured in the city's goal. Durango focused on ""electricity"" to encourage a transition from fossil fuels to all electricity, such as electric cars or solar-powered climate control in buildings versus gas cars or coal furnaces. Of the 113 initial responses, only 29 are visible to the public. Most of those respondents, more than 60%, said the city's goals were not stringent enough. Several people said the goals can and should be reached sooner.
""Why wouldn't we at least match Colorado's targets, if not be even more ambitious?"" said one respondent, who did not share their name. The majority, more than 75%, said they were ""very concerned"" about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preparing for climate change impacts and reducing Durango's reliance on fossil fuels. ""Climate change is, in 2020, an all-hands-on-deck emergency for the viability of our economy and civil society,"" said Sarah Kelly, a Durango resident, in her response. 
Mountain biking in Colorado brought us together over ten years ago and we've been enjoying two wheels, the outdoors, and the North Fork community ever since. We own SK Bikes in Paonia, a small bike shop providing bicycle sales and service in the North Fork Valley. Visitors and locals love our area because it is a clean, picturesque, and sparsely-populated area with wide-open public lands. Although tourism here has decreased due to the pandemic, many of us locals are still recreating responsibly outside. Our shop has been busier than ever and, after years of running the shop by ourselves, we recently hired three employees. We're all eager to stave off the mental and physical impacts of the pandemic with time spent outdoors.
When it's safe to visit the North Fork Valley again, we expect tourists to enjoy the Valley as they did before the pandemic, seeking outdoor recreation, adventure, and untouched views whether on two wheels, hiking, fishing, hunting, or off-roading.
Alarmingly, the North Fork's outdoor recreation and tourism economy is now threatened under the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) plan to hand over all of the North Fork Valley's public land to oil and gas development. This plan will devastate the local economy and quality of life, and makes zero economic sense given the U.S. oil surplus. For all of the Administration's talk of supporting local voices, BLM's plan ignores a broadly-supported, community-based proposal that represents the community's own vision of the future. The BLM's plan undoes all of the progress we've made transitioning to a more sustainable, diversified economy.
Senator Bennet opposes BLM's plan and has committed to working with local groups on ways to rectify it. We're grateful for the Senator's leadership and thank him for his support.  As a historic coal-mining region, the North Fork Valley community has been able to diversify its economy over the past decade and reimagine itself into a bustling agriculture, recreation, and tourism hub.
According to the Outdoor Industry Association, residents here in Colorado's 3rd District spend over $2 billion on outdoor recreation each year, and out-of-state visitors spend nearly $13 billion. Statewide, outdoor recreation generates 229,000 jobs and $28 billion in annual consumer spending. Outdoor recreation is an important part of local and state economies and we're proud to be a contributor to this industry.
BLM's final plan gives away beloved places like Jumbo Mountain, Paonia Reservoir, and the headwaters of the North Fork of the Gunnison River watershed. We need these places like never before. Once they're handed over to oil and gas development, we're unlikely to ever get them back. BLM's plan is particularly illogical given that the U.S. currently has more oil and gas than there is demand and that it can store. On top of this, oil and gas companies already hold nearly 10,000 unused drilling permits nationwidewhich means the land is not producing oil or gas nor is it available or accessible for the public's use. Why is BLM fast-tracking plans to sell long-term leases on millions more acres of public lands to oil and gas companies for next to nothing?
To add insult to injury, BLM finalized the plan during a national emergency and timed its release during the Easter and Passover holidays. This is another reminder of the Administration's cavalier attitude towards the public and outright dismissal of our community's 10-year involvement in the planning process.
The North Fork Alternative is the name of the plan created by a diverse group of local farmers, business owners, realtors, conservationists, owners of vineyards, and ranchers. The North Fork Alternative is a workable strategy for our region's public lands that balances development with an investment in outdoor recreation, agriculture, and conservation. Our proposal supports a diverse economy for our region, which will make it more sustainable and resilient long into the future. In 2016, BLM considered our proposal in their planning process. We're frustrated that the Trump Administration has since dismissed the North Fork Alternative, and ignored widespread public opposition to BLM's final plan.
Protecting public lands is a concern nationwide, especially in the face of the national pandemic and a changing climate. Protecting the biodiversity and natural resources within public lands is a key strategy for our collective ability to adapt to climate change. Senator Bennet's ""30x30"" plan that calls for protecting 30% of the nation's lands and oceans by 2030 is possible if places like the North Fork Valley are protected now and into the future from drilling and development.
We appreciate Senator Bennet's commitment to working with local communities on this issue and we invite you to join us in thanking Senator Bennet for his support for our North Fork Valley public lands. We can't imagine the North Fork Valley without our lush landscapes, pristine peaks, crystal-clear waters and the multitude of places to recreate. Under the BLM's plan, we'll lose our identity as a destination for adventure-seekers and recreators. The plan destroys what all of us treasure about the North Fork Valley and erodes the public lands' legacy we hope to leave behind for future generations."

The prospect of testifying before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission might be unnerving for a lot of
people, but Ean Tafoya was excited about being cross-examined during a recenthearing.
""Huge for me and the (environmental justice) coalition,"" Tafoya wrote in a text to The Denver Post before
the Wednesday hearing on a utility's plan to help move the state's transition to electric vehicles forward.
Tafoya, the Colorado field advocate for GreenLatinos, referred to ""the power of the mic"" to convey the
positions of his organization and other members of the Environmental Justice Coalition on Black Hills
Energy's proposal.
The advocates will also weigh in on Xcel Energy-Colorado's new electric resource plan, focusing on the
impacts they believe the utility's decisions will have on communities that have borne much of the brunt of
pollution from power plants and other heavy industry.
Tafoya, 35, grew up in northeast Denver, an area once labeled the nation's most polluted ZIP code as a
result of decades of industrial activity that contaminated the air, water and soil. The area is home to an oil
refinery, a natural gas power plant and two Superfund sites. Residents also contend with emissions from
vehicles speeding by on Interstate 70, which is undergoing major reconstruction in the area.
""The entire area is probably one of the worst air-pollution areas in the entire country,"" Tafoya said.
Activists and elected officials say it's time that low-income communities and people of color who have
been disproportionately affected by industrial pollution have a say about how or whether the activity
should continue in their backyards. At the federal and state levels, there is a push to make environmental
justice a priority in decisions on transportation, energy projects and whether land should be developed or
left open.
A handful of bills moving through the Colorado General Assembly address environmental justice. One,
Senate Bill 21-200, would set specific caps on greenhouse-gas emissions as well as establish an
environmental justice ombudsperson position and an advisory board in the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment.
""Climate change and pollution hurt all of us. It doesn't necessarily hurt all of us evenly,"" state Rep.
Dominique Jackson, an Aurora Democrat, said during a news conference last week.
Jackson is sponsoring HB 21-1266, which would create a task force to make recommendations to the
legislature on strategies, policies and programs for confronting environmental inequities statewide. The
bill requires the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission to reach out to communities that have suffered
more harmful environmental effects than others.
The opportunity to speak in a PUC hearing, a first for Tafoya, was an important step in providing a voice
for people who face higher pollution levels, greater health risks and have less input into environmental
laws and policies, he said.
""The PUC has not been the most friendly place for environmental justice advocates. It's not been a place
in which we've engaged effectively in the past,"" Tafoya said. ""It's been clear that our voice has been
missing.
""But it seems to me they're turning that corner,"" he added.
As Xcel Energy seeks approval from the PUC for its new electric resource plan, Tafoya and other
advocates hope to participate in the process. Xcel, Colorado's largest electric utility, has been
commended for its strides in adding more renewable energy to its portfolio. The utility's resource and
clean energy plan filed in March with the PUC proposes cutting greenhouse-gas emissions 85% by 2030
and getting about 80% of its power from renewable sources by 2030. All its coal operations will be retired
by 2040, according to the plan.
Environmental and community activists want Xcel Energy to shut down coal faster. And they would like
to see the Cherokee natural gas plant in northeast Denver phased out and replaced with renewable
energy and the Comanche 3 coal-fired plant in Pueblo closed before the planned retirement of 2040.
While burning natural gas produces roughly half the carbon dioxide of coal, the methane it emits is a
potent greenhouse gas. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is about 84 times more powerful in
the short term than carbon dioxide at trapping heat.
""Natural gas isn't the solution that it's touted as. We want to see a transition to renewables to prevent
further exacerbating the climate crisis,"" said Ren-Caspar Smith, an organizer with the Sierra Club.
For years Xcel Energy-Colorado has been listening to and working with the communities it serves about
their interest in moving to more renewable energy, said Alice Jackson, the utility's president. The new
resource plan reflects that progress, she said.
""It's just a huge step forward and it's well beyond what anybody thought we were going to be able to do in
this time frame,"" Jackson said.
In 2018, Xcel announced a goal of being carbon-free by 2050, making it the first major utility to set such a
goal.
At the same time, Jackson said, the company sees having a diverse set of power resources as key to
delivering affordable and reliable electricity ""all day, every day."" Continuing to operate the Cherokee gas
plant and the Comanche 3 coal unit until 2040 are part of the plan to do that, she said.
""Fuel diversity is important right now. Technology hasn't developed to the point yet where we can sit
there and say we don't need these other types of resources in order to be able to provide reliable service
for our customers,"" Jackson said.
The freezing weather in February caused power outages from Texas to the Midwest and sent natural
gas prices soaring across the region, including in Colorado, but Xcel Energy kept the power flowing,
Jackson said.
""There is a need for firm capacity and reliability, resources that can turn on and off easily whenever
needed for as long as they're needed, but gas isn't the only way to provide that,"" said Smith.
Renewable energy sources, battery storage, managed demand and connecting to a regional
transmission network are other options, Smith said. Beyond the price of gas are concerns about the
health effects, such as respiratory problems, from living around power plants or where the gas is drilled,
he added.
""When we talk about plants like Cherokee in north Denver, we can't forget about the environmental
justice concerns. It's an extremely densely populated area,"" Smith said. ""About 67,000 people live within
three miles of that plant and are breathing that air every day.""
Tafoya said there are multiple sources of pollution in the area that includes where he grew up, the Cole
neighborhood, and the Elyria-Swansea neighborhood. The Suncor Energy oil refinery, to the north, has a
history of malfunctions and, along with the Cherokee and Comanche power plants, is among the state's
top 20 greenhouse gas polluters, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency records.
""You can see the Cherokee gas plant towers from my mom's front yard,"" Tafoya said in a video
produced by the Sierra Club.
In an interview, Tafoya said he knows of many people in the neighborhood who have asthma, including
his godson.
""When we saw COVID start to happen, we saw the connection between respiratory diseases and pre-
existing conditions,"" Tafoya said. ""COVID hit our community hard.""
A Denver Environmental Health report said the predominantly Latino neighborhoods of Elyria and
Swansea neighborhoods suffer some of the highest rates of asthma, cardiovascular disease and other
illnesses in the city for a number of reasons. The EPA's EJSCREEN, an environmental justice mapping
tool, shows the Cole neighborhood in the 89th percentile for small particulate pollution, which means only
11% of the state has higher levels.
Sources of particulate matter pollution, which has been linked to lung and heart disease, include power
plants and vehicles, according to the EPA.
""Xcel takes the environment seriously,"" Jackson said. ""We're looking at it pretty holistically: the cost, the
economic impact on the communities, the emissions, air quality, as well as jobs.""
The Cherokee plant was converted from coal to natural gas as part of the Colorado $1 billion Clean AirClean Jobs Act program approved in 2010 to cut air pollution.
""The reduced emissions that we've realized at that plant are dramatic,"" Jackson said. ""Nitrous oxide is
down by more than 95%. SO2 (sulfur dioxide) is down over 99.9%, and mercury has been completely
eliminated.""
Comanche 3 in Pueblo will be the last of Xcel Energy's coal plants to close. Xcel has proposed running it
at no more than a third of its capacity after 2030 and shuttering it by 2040. Jackson said the plant will
provide reliable, affordable energy as Xcel makes the transition to ""a new energy future.""
Jackson acknowledged the mechanical problems that idled Comanche 3 for most of 2020, but said it has
been a good plant on the system.
But a scathing report by the PUC released March 1 paints a different picture, one of a chronically
malfunctioning unit whose operating and electricity costs have been higher than projected before its 2010
opening. The upfront capital cost projection for Comanche 3 was $680 million, but wound up being $784
million. The plant averaged 91.5 days per year of unplanned outages over the last decade.
""The Comanche 3 plant, not only is it a lemon in what it's costing the consumer, it's also polluting other
Latinos in Pueblo. I don't want to see that happen to anybody,"" Tafoya said.

Advocates say financial analysis shows Boulder muni would re.txt,"Advocates say financial analysis shows Boulder muni would reap
benefits
October 31, 2020  Colorado Daily (Boulder, CO)
Author: Deborah Swearingen Section: Boulder Area News 1220 Words
OpenURL Link
A report released earlier this month argues that moving forward with municipalization would bring in more
than $100 million for Boulder over the span of a decade and allow the city to convert to 100% renewable
energy.
Empower Our Future, a local coalition with a stated commitment to clean energy that conducted and
released the report, is hopeful it will dissuade people from voting for ballot initiative 2C, which pauses the
city's years-long effort to form its own local electric utility in favor of a 20-year franchise agreement with
Xcel Energy. Should that happen, Empower Our Future believes its financial analysis could guide
Boulder's path forward, particularly if it continues its municipalization effort or chooses to get its electricity
from a source other than Xcel.
Proponents of the measure, such as those involved with Boulder's Great Green Deal, believe
municipalization is no longer the best means of fighting climate change and instead view the Xcel
franchise agreement as the cheapest and most effective way to do so.
When Boulder first embarked on the quest to form its own electric utility, the city viewed the idea as a
means of maintaining the system's reliability, controlling rates and deploying renewable energy.
Supporters say that's still the case, while opponents believe it's time to move on.
Alison Burchell, a geologist and member of Empower Our Future, said the recently released financial
report and the city's municipalization efforts in general can be a guide for other communities looking to
impact meaningful change.
""We are not just doing this for Boulder,"" Burchell said. ""The purpose of doing the muni is to demonstrate
that munis are successful, have lower rates and can actually deliver on the goals we have.""
Process
Volunteers with Empower Our Future said they spent hundreds of hours and many late nights on the
report. In an Oct. 20 news conference, the group explained how they arrived at their conclusions using
Boulder's 2018 financial forecasting tool and updating it with 2020 data and assumptions.
Group members said there have been significant changes since the city last conducted a financial
forecast in 2018, including lower renewable energy prices and bond rates. It prompted them to take
another look.
""We think this is probably a better deal than ever but nobody's really updated it or looked at the figures so
we're going to do that for them,"" Empower Our Future member Susan Peterson said of the group's
decision to proceed with the financial analysis.
The group used data, much of it pulled from city documents, including the city's 2018 financial forecast
and its 2020 request for proposals that Boulder issued for utility- and community-scale electric power
supply and innovative financing options. Empower Our Future said it was hopeful the city would review
the report and provide feedback, but that has not happened.
Emily Sandoval, spokesperson for the city, acknowledged Empower Our Future's use of city documents
as source material, but she said the city was not involved in the process and hasn't reviewed the
analysis.
""We appreciate the community's exploration of our financial forecast tool, but we can't confirm the validity
of individual analyses conducted by the community,"" Sandoval said.
Key takeaways
The local power financial analysis indicates that, by Empower Our Future's estimate, Boulder would in 10
years have a $182.4 million cumulative cash flow in its ""break-even"" forecast, which used the most
conservative data. The group estimates that the number could be as high as $492.7 million in its ""even
better"" category.
In the report, Empower Our Future said it got to the cumulative cash flow by calculating the revenue
brought in minus the expenditures after working capital and capital improvements have been funded. It
uses sample rates from the Public Service Company of Colorado and customer totals compiled in 2019
by Xcel Energy. The report also factors in the debt service coverage ratio, inflation and numerous other
factors.
The report also states that local power would have a substantial climate impact. By 2030, Empower Our
Future believes local power would bring the city to 100% renewably sourced electricity and 100%
greenhouse gas reductions, and it would produce 215,000 fewer megatons of greenhouse gas relative to
Xcel.
Peterson said she often thinks about how far technology has come in the past decade or so.
""In the next 20 years, our electric system and our energy system in general is going to enjoy a similar
renaissance, a similar paradigm shift in new technologies, in energy sourcing, in energy storage and in
energy distribution,"" Peterson said.
The Xcel question
Members of Empower Our Future recognize that Xcel is making improvements in the fight against
climate change, but they fear the company is not moving fast enough.
""Our challenge now is that Xcel's moving in the right direction, but they're also what I call slow walking,""
group member Leslie Glustrom said.
Mayor Pro Tem Bob Yates, on the other hand, said Xcel has made great strides, and he believes the
settlement will offer Boulder an opportunity to ""get green,"" which has been the goal all along. Yates knew
of the local power financial analysis but said he hadn't reviewed it.
""We didn't start this process 10 years ago so we could operate a utility profitably,"" he said.
Yates, who is a proponent of the Xcel franchise agreement and helped lead settlement talks with the
power company, often references the $25 million the city has spent thus far in its effort to form its own
utility. The city in July announced that without additional funding, it couldn't afford to hold a vote on
establishing a municipal utility this year.
""We're spending a lot of time, and we're spending a lot of money, and we're really not getting anything to
show for it,"" he said. ""Municipalization may have served its purpose, but now it's time to move on and
undertake meaningful and immediate climate action.""
The local power financial analysis does not specifically address this in its report, though it did send an
email citing a city update that indicates there is some funding available for the effort through 2022.
Other supporters of the ballot measure agree with Yates' assertion that time is of the essence.
""The climate crisis is time sensitive. Winning slowly is the same as losing,"" Boulder's Great Green Deal
supporter Elizabeth Hartman said in a statement on the organization's website.
Still, while Empower Our Future agrees that Boulder has spent a lot of money on municipalization over
the years, its report found that moving forward with the effort or another local power option would offer a
substantial return on investment.
""In a very short period of time this investment pays back to the community big time,"" Peterson said.
Ballot measure 2C
If the Xcel franchise agreement passes on Tuesday, Boulder will still have opportunities to opt out and
continue on the path to municipalization or explore other energy options. The city can opt out for any
reason at any time in the fifth, 10th and 15th year of the agreement. It also can opt out in several other
years if Xcel is not meeting its commitments, including one wherein Xcel agreed to reduce its 2005
carbon emission levels by 80% by 2023.
Though these provisions are provided, Sandoval said a favorable vote on Tuesday would pause work on
a local electric utility for the time being.
""It gets a little muddled, but the key is that if it passes, municipalization work would stop for at least the
next few years,"" Sandoval said.

After_the_beetles_Forests_starting_to_recover__Post_Independent_Glenwood_Springs_CO___February_24_2020.txt,"As Colorado's bark beetle infestations have faded, ideas have changed about the insects' impacts on mountain ecology and the prospects for wildfires in beetle-afflicted areas.
A recent study of forest recovery by Robert Andrus, Sarah Hart and Thomas Veblen was recently published in the journal of the Ecological Society of America. Andrus and Veblen are professors in the Geography department at the University of Colorado Boulder. Hart is a professor in the department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin Madison.
The study focused primarily on forest recovery in Colorado's southern mountains. But in a telephone interview, Veblen said many of those findings are also relevant in Colorado's central and northern mountains.
Veblen noted that in the early 2000s, a mountain pine beetle outbreak that began in the 1990s attracted a lot of attention from politicians and some land managers.
Veblen said the ""initial, knee-jerk reaction"" was that the abundance of dead trees would lead to an increase in the probability of the outbreak and severity of wildfires.
Over the ensuing years, Veblen said that fear ""is not justified.""
The drive to ""do something"" about the outbreaks resulted in widespread logging to reduce the fire hazard. That wasn't really necessary.
What happened?
Veblen said that fire hazard depends in large part on ""fine fuels,"" including grasses and needles dropping from dead and dying trees. But putting more of those fuels on the ground has resulted in a decline in the probability of forest -consuming ""crown fires,"" in which fire jumps from treetop to treetop.
But Veblen added, dead and dying trees can make access to fire sites ""extremely hazardous,"" particularly in stands of lodgepole pine, the dominant species in this area.
By the 1990s, those stands of lodgepole pine were roughly 100 years old, the result of widespread fires in the middle of the 19th century. T rees that old were ripe for a beetle infestation.
Over the past 15 years or so, land managers have altered their thinking to concentrate more on what's called the wildland-urban interface -- zones where human development comes in contact with wildlands.
Veblen said at this point, the idea is to concentrate efforts in those areas, as well as roads and trails into the forests.
Paul Cada is the Vail Fire Department's wildland specialist. Vail has much of the valley's wildland urban interface. In a phone interview, Cada agreed that fire behavior has changed due to beetle infestations.
Evolving management
What's known about the post-beetle landscape has changed how land and forest managers view fires, and how to prepare for fires. The town is now in the final stages of drafting a community wildfire protection plan, and those changes will be incorporated.
""The goal is to prevent landscape-scale, high-severity events,"" Cada said. That approach includes letting some fires do their work. The challenge, Cada said, is to identify ways to contain fires to a relatively small area.
In a standard fire season, Cada said most fires are confined to small areas ranging from a single tree to less than an acre. That same season might see a few slightly larger fires of up to 15 acres. Larger fires usually require some kind of ""significant"" weather, say a dry winter followed by a hot summer.
To keep those fires small, measures near the wildland urban interface include forest thinning and creating openings in the forest canopy.
Outside of the lodgepole forests, there are a number of local aspen stands that are getting on the ""over mature"" side, Cada said, adding that those stands have been growing too long without being thinned by a naturally occurring fire. In those cases, some prescribed burning could be useful.
Those fires mean land managers are picking the time, place and weather conditions that have the most benefit and lowest risk, Cada said. That particularly applies to interface areas.
Over the past 15 years or so, as the wildland interface has expanded, thinking about fire management has shifted.
The thinking a few years ago was ""control the vegetation and the problem goes away,"" Cada said. But large fires such as the Camp Fire in California revealed a different reality -- fire jumping from home to home, without much damage to surrounding vegetation.
The evolving management philosophy led town of Vail officials last year to pass revised building codes mandating more fire-resistant materials in new construction.
And ideas continue to shift about wildfire near populated areas.
""Almost monthly there's some new, groundbreaking research about building components or ways communities are engaging (around the interface),"" Cada said. That's why it's important for communities to stay as up to date as possible, he added.""
Back in the forest
While ideas about wildfires are changing, there's good news from the affected forests.
Veblen said at the beginning of the beetle outbreaks, land managers worried about long-term recovery. Those concerns turned out to be largely unfounded.
""Leave the forest alone and it'll be fine,"" Veblen said.
But that doesn't mean the forest growing now will look like the one devastated by insects.
Veblen said land managers are seeing a good deal of species replacement in the natural new growth coming up through the dead trees.
Some lodgepole pine is being replaced by aspen and subalpine fir trees, he said. Spruce is popping up at higher elevations.
Current conditions provide land managers with some advice for the coming decades.
""Management should be aimed at efforts to improve recovery,"" Veblen said. ""You would want to create pre-outbreak conditions of small trees.""
But that regeneration may not be obvious at first glance.
""It may take 20 years or so for big lodgepole pines to fall over,"" Veblen said. ""But walk around in those forests, and recovery is well underway.""

By Mark Rackay
Mother Nature has a strange way of dealing with the environment she supervises. First, she gives you a drought that puts a stranglehold on every living thing. Second, she causes all the flora and fauna to die from lack of water, all the while giving all the wildlife a ferocious beating. Lastly, she sends a massive wildfire along to clean out everything she previously harmed or destroyed.
There is an area I used to frequent in Everglades National Park, near Flamingo on the Florida Bay side. One of the rivers that dumped in the bay had a growth of very rare Black Mangrove trees. These trees were nearing 200 years old and stood witness to a time in the everglades long before man was there. Mangrove trees only grow in saltwater. The area was called ""The Black Forest .""
A severe hurricane blew through, killing the several mile-long stand of black mangroves, leaving broken and mangled limbs, with no survivors. T hree years later, during a severe drought, a fire swept through the area, wiping out any trace of those rare trees. The old bat made the mess and then cleaned it up. In a generation, nobody will even remember those trees were once there.
Here on the Western Slope, we have endured a drought of biblical proportions, and hope to never see a repeat performance. I need not remind you that the 2018 wildfireseason was one of the worst in Colorado history. Hundreds of thousands of acres, many homes and much personal property were destroyed by wildfires across the state, pushing people and resources to the limit. This year has been just as bad with the big fires in Mesa County and Glenwood Canyon.
One of the major impacts a fire has is the destruction of the landscape. The fire removes all the vegetative cover, leaving the ground unprotected and vulnerable to severe flooding and erosion. This impact will not only affect folks living in the burned over area, but also those living downstream.
Wildfires alter the properties of the soil, through extreme heating. In many cases, the soil will actually repel water, increasing run-off. An increased run-off leads to even more soil erosion, and sediment carried downstream and deposited into our reservoirs.
In the short term, wildfires are devastating to wildlife. Aside from immediate death from the fire, there will be a lack of shelter and food sources for those who survive. Most animals have an instinct for survival from fire . Some flee, while others burrow themselves in the ground.
The tender growth that emerges shortly after a fire will cause the wildlife to return to the burned over area. Some species, especially in the west, have evolved with fires, and actually require it for their long-term survival.
Wildfires seem to be impacting homes and communities with more frequency in recent years. As people move away from the urban areas and into the wild land, this will be an ongoing problem.
Fire mitigation is becoming more important to property owners than ever before.
The social and economic impacts to a community after a wildfire (or any disaster) are devastating, complex and very long lasting. T ake it from a guy who has seen his town destroyed by a hurricane, several times, and had to rebuild and start over. The mental anguish can last the rest of your life.
Aside from the obvious economic loss from destruction of homes and business, there are more long-lasting problems. Consider the lost sales tax and revenues from the interruption of ""business as usual."" For Colorado, we see a reduction in revenue from reduced recreation and tourism due to a reduced access to public lands.
If that is not enough, Mother Nature may have even more tricks up her sleeve. There could be more disasters following the fire , such as catastrophic mudslides. All it takes is a solid rain on that burned over area, to wreak more havoc to the area, and raging waters and mudslides follow. More fun for those trying to rebuild.
One of the things often done after a fire is the removal of the dead and dying trees. Salvage logging is one tactic landowners use to regenerate a burned over area. T rees decay very soon after a fire and lose all their value for lumber and other wood products. In order to retain any value from burned trees, salvage logging must begin immediately after a fire.
Once the dead trees are removed, a mix of natural seeding and planting can occur. As the canopy from the newly-regenerated forest begins to close, the undergrowth and habitat will begin to return but this process is slow.
The Bucktail fire burned thousands of acres in the Uncompahgre National Forest , about 8 miles northeast of Nucla in 2002. The fire was started by lightning and burned through mostly ponderosa pine and oak brush. Crews numbering more than 400 people fought the blaze.
I visit the area every year to monitor the recovery of the forestation and wildlife. Sixteen years later, the burn scar over the top of the mountain is still very evident.
There are those who say, ""Let the fires burn"" because it is part of the natural process. People and wildfires are becoming more entwined as we move further into the wild lands around our urban areas.
Fires are part of the natural ecosystem process, and with the projected climate change, they are forecasted to become even more prevalent. We must learn to live with fire. There are many programs available, on the State and National level thathelp with mitigation of property, thathelp create a more resilient landscape so we can coexist with wildfires.
Personally, I would rather have the Black Forest of Mangroves back. I miss seeing them, but Ma Nature thought otherwise. Let's hope she sends us a much wetter winter season, so we don't have to deal with the effects of those devastating wildfires.

Thirteen-year-olds can AirDrop Simpsons memes from across the room, and artificial intelligence made chess masters like Garry Kasparov obsolete. But for all our technological advances, at home, we're still cavemen.
Just as early man cooked raw meat over campfire coals, modern humans heat with flame, too, using natural gas drilled from the ground, even occasionally searing a poblano pepper on the range. ""Og like gas. Gas keep Og warm.""
We can do better, in the same way that we're moving away from generating electricity by burning flammable rocks. Instead, we're making power with thin-film, solar photovoltaics, wind turbines made from fiberglass and advanced composites, and solar thermal molten-salt storage arrays in the desert.
To keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, we need to do a lot of things: slash transportation pollution, manage agricultural emissions, and more. But perhaps the most challenging task of all is to decarbonize buildings. The Rocky Mountain Institute notes that a tenth of U.S. carbon emissions come from burning fossil fuels -- primarily gas -- for heating and cooking in homes and businesses.
Nationally, $3.7 trillion worth of new construction is in process, and the top two states are in the West -- California and Texas. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of these structures will be heated with gas.
The best, and maybe only, way to decarbonize buildings, beyond making them so efficient that they hardly need space heat (which we should do anyway), is to replace Neanderthal heating methods with electric systems powered by renewables.
While it's true that the grid isn't entirely green yet, that transition is well underway, aided by trends that will displace existing coal even if demand grows. Nevada is an example: voters there amended its constitution this November to require half the state's power to be renewable by 2030.
Electrifying buildings will be a slow process; we need to start now, because it will take decades. But while there's urgency, leadership is limited. To fully decarbonize the building sector, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute, states need ""explicit electrification requirements and concrete phase-out strategies for gas in buildings"" at a minimum.
There are pockets of progress. San Francisco's Board of Supervisors recently voted unanimously to ban natural gas in new buildings, and other cities in California are implementing similar plans. Seattle passed a law to help homeowners transition from oil, a particularly dirty form of heating, to electricity. But California has always been an environmental unicorn, and Seattle's law is unique. Both states are also relatively wealthy.
Meanwhile, resistance looms large. One of the West's largest utilities, Xcel Energy, recently released a document titled ""T ransitioning Natural Gas for a Low Carbon Future."" It focuses on voluntary customer electrification and reductions in gas leakage, without ever confronting the fact that customers can't continue to burn gas and still meet any reasonable climate goals.
Since we can't count on federal action, and most states are not leading holistically, the only alternative is to change municipal codes. All of the towns where we live, in Colorado's Roaring Fork Valley, have upgraded to at least the 2015 International Energy Conservation Code, but that doesn't get us far enough. Municipalities need to adopt electrification codes, which can take a number of forms, from a straight ban on natural gas to more incentive-based programs.
The good news is that going all-electric is entirely doable. Developers where I live are already making it happen. Habitat for Humanity's teacher housing in the town of Basalt avoided the cost of installing gas lines; teachers will cook their mac and cheese on advanced induction ranges. Aspen Skiing Company, where one of the authors of this column works, is building a 150-bed, fourstory employee housing complex heated by electricity, complete with electric vehicle-charging stations. Rocky Mountain Institute's office in Basalt is the highest performing building in the coldest climate zone in the United States, and it uses no gas. In Snowmass Village, East West Partners is developing the aptly named 53-unit Electric Pass Lodge.
These success stories from high-end areas hardly scratch the surface of what's possible. But their exceptionalism shows the transition will not happen on the free market, as many libertarian dreamers in the West hope. And it won't occur on the timeframe required to meet emissions targets set by the states or required by atmospheric physics.
Discovering fire was a milestone for humankind, but rediscovering electricity will be a climate game changer.

Allenspark_firefighters_get_needed_equipment__Estes_Park_Trail-Gazette_CO___May_27_2021.txt,"nsp ark fire fighters ge t ne e de d e q uip me nt - Este s Park Trail-Gaze tte (CO ) - May 27, 2021
May 27, 2021  Estes Park Trail-Gazette (CO)  Wendy Rig by
The extraordinary wildfire season of 2021 brought the need for updated equipment into sharp focus for the Allenspark Fire Department. With 32 volunteer firefighters, communication is key. Old radios put them at a disadvantage.
""We have so many physical blocks,"" volunteer firefighter Johnathon Oppermann explained. ""There are trees and changes in elevation and hills and valleys. It's difficult sometimes to get clear communication through and sometime to get any communication.""
The Allenspark community heard the clarion call of the fire department. In four short months, the Area Club raised almost $90,000 to buy 32 brand new digital radios which will help the firefighters immensely.
""Our tagline was, 'A radio for a hero,'"" said T amara Durstine who headed up the fundraising effort. ""Most people would go to homeowner and say they saved your house. My strategy was this is about the firefighters being safe. It's all about them getting home safe at night after protecting our homes. We can evacuate. They ran toward the fire. We ran away from the fire.""
New Allenspark Fire Department Chief Mike Cousineau is amazed by the outpouring of financial support from the community.
""These radios give us a lot of capabilities,"" Couseineau said. ""When we have federal fires , we have to change channels constantly. Now out firefighters can do that easily in the field. In the past, we've just been buying used radios. They are already old. They start dropping like flies in the first year we have them. We always wanted new ones.""
The digital radios purchased by the department are also water and fire resistant.
Looking back on the 2020 wildfires in Northern Colorado, Oppermann remembered the overwhelming feeling of trepidation.
""It was really scary to know that all of the areas that were burning were so close to us,"" he remembered. ""We had the Lefthand Fire, the Calwood Fire, the East Troublesome Fire and the Cameron Peak Fire. My involvement was on the Calwood Fire and also the East Troublesome Fire the days that it jumped the Continental Divide. It was terrifying. We sat doing lookout atop a hill just watching flames at about 1 o'clock in the morning light up the night sky. We knew that cold weather was coming. We just sat there and prayed that we wouldn't see the fire advance further before the weather would come in and give us some assistance.""
With the success of the recent fundraising effort by the Area Club, the department has now asked for another $30,000 to help fund necessary maintenance, batteries and insurance.
""We wouldn't put our own children or wives or husbands out there without good equipment,""
Durstine commented. ""They have to have good equipment. It's their lives.""
On Sunday, May 23, the Allenspark Fire Departmentheld an open house to thank the community and to thank Leo Touzjian who is stepping away from his role has chief after six years. He was presented with a golden firefighting axe.
The Allenspark Fire Protection District covers 160 square miles in rural Larimer and Boulder Counties. The district has mutual aid agreements with neighboring departments including Estes Park, Lyons, Indian Peaks, Lefthand Canyon, Pinewood Springs and the U.S. Forest Service.

Clear Creek County and Historic District Public Lands lands will close to the public at 12:01 a.m. Friday because of high fire danger. The only exception is the land used by the Georgetown Loop Railroad.
This includes all trails owned by Silver Plume and Georgetown, as well as Open Space parks and trails.
Additionally, Idaho Springs also has closed Virginia Canyon Mountain Park, and Colorado Parks & Wildlife has closed the Georgetown, Bergen Peak and Mount Evans State Wildlife Areas.
Since U.S. Forest Service and Denver Mountain Parks lands also have been closed, this effectively closes all public lands in Clear Creek County.
The U.S. Forest Service implemented a Stage 3 fire ban Wednesday and closed all Arapaho & Roosevelt National Forest lands in Clear Creek and four other counties. Denver Mountain Parks followed shortly thereafter.
The Clear Creek Board of County Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution closing the lands Thursday, saying the closures would be lifted when the USFS' Stage 3 fire ban is lifted.
Additionally, the county's Stage 2 fire ban has been updated so that no hunting is permitted even on private lands. This will also be lifted with the USFS' Stage 3 fire ban.
Overall, these restrictions are necessary to take the human factor out of the potential for new wildfires, Clear Creek District Ranger Scott Haas described during the commissioners meeting.
While a winter storm is in the forecast for this weekend, Haas said local fuels are so dry that it will do little to get Colorado out of its current fire danger.
""Our fuels right now are drier than the paper that's sitting in your printer,"" he said, ""which is unprecedented.""
Haas added that the U.S. Forest Service is working with the Clear Creek Sheriff's Office, the Colorado Department of Transportation and Clear Creek Road & Bridge to get signs and barriers out to key locations to inform people of the closures and prevent them from accessing USFS trailheads.
Commissioner Randy Wheelock said the county would likewise work to sign and barricade its Open Space properties to ensure everyone is aware of the closures. He asked for the public's cooperation as enforcement will be difficult with so many local first responders helping with evacuations in Grand County.
""This is what we're doing collectively to protect our community and the forests,"" Wheelock continued.

Aspen, fortunately, doesn't wait for Earth Day to try to do right by Mother Earth.
There are countless shining examples year-round of Roaring Fork Valley residents taking action to
benefit the environment.
Aspen Center for Environmental Studies and Roaring Fork Conservancy have outstanding educational
programs to nurture a connection with nature among students.
Aspen Valley Land Trust works with ranchers and other landowners to conserve vistas and sensitive
lands from development. Wilderness Workshop fights to protect the most important unspoiled lands for
people and wildlife.
Roaring Fork Outdoor Volunteers, Independence Pass Foundation and Roaring Fork Mountain Bike
Association take pressure off beleaguered public land management agencies to maintain trails and
habitat.
Local governments have also set the bar high. Pitkin County Open Space and Trails has improved the
quality of life for recreationists and wildlife. Pitkin County Healthy Rivers and Streams is taking vital steps
to protect our waterways. The city of Aspen became an energy efficiency leader by switching to clean
energy.
The region's electricity cooperative, Holy Cross Energy, is a leader in the push for renewables.
The list of organizations and individuals taking notable steps for the sake of sustainability goes on and
on.
But the valley has its share of environmental failures. The upper valley produces jobs but not enough
affordable housing for its workers. The number of vehicles buzzing up Highway 82 to the beehive in the
morning and departing in the afternoon is an embarrassment.
Opulent McMansions define conspicuous consumption because of the resources needed to build and
run them.
The corporate jets whisking a handful of passengers in and out of town for an action-packed getaway
make a mockery of Aspen's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.
As recreation booms, we're loving our trails and wild spaces to death while the resort marketers continue
to try to lure increasing numbers to fill the lodges, shops and restaurants.
So as we celebrate Earth Day in its 51st year, we turned to some of the area's leading environmental
voices to help take stock of how Aspen and the Roaring Fork Valley are doing on the environmental
front.

'THE VILLAGE IN ACTION'
KARIN TEAGUE
The Roaring Fork Valley excels at coming together as a village to take care of the environment that we
all cherish: our wild landscapes, rivers, trails, clean air, and wildlife. Our village is unparalleled in
supporting local environmental nonprofits like the Independence Pass Foundation with its volunteer time
and financial backing. Moreover, our non-profits consistently cooperate and partner with each other, and
with local governments, businesses, and civic organizations, to a degree I believe unequaled in America.
This spirit of cooperation and giving stands as a testament to our village's deep commitment to taking
care of this place. As one IPF board member put it, when asked about the enormous time and energy he
expends on behalf of IPF and Independence Pass, ""This place has been good to me."" Indeed.
But we need to work on practicing restraint. Living uncomfortably side by side with our village's
stewardship ethic is our propensity for accepting, or even demanding, enormous homes, new trails and
deforested ski runs, seamless commercial and private jet access, more events attracting more visitors,
and never-ending construction, among other things. We all know the results: increased carbon
emissions, traffic, wildlife decline, and noise, air, and light pollution. Committed as we are to being good
environmental stewards, we are no match for climate change and its attendant impacts of drought,
wildfire, and beetle-devastated forests, and for the immediately tangible effects of more and more people
and development.
Restraint  across all sectors, in our private, public, and political lives, for the good of our grandchildren
and the living things we share the planet with  must become a value we cherish as much as direct
environmental stewardship. Otherwise, we will lose the clean air and water and healthy wild lands and
wildlife that brought so many of us here, and that motivate us every day to be good stewards. The entire
village, including me, including those who celebrate Earth Day and those who eschew it, must get better
at practicing restraint. Until we do, no one gets a trophy.

'WE ARE DOING GREAT. BUT WE CAN DO BETTER.'
AUDEN SCHENDLER
There are three buckets the Roaring Fork Valley needs to address when it comes to climate impact: the
utility grid, buildings, and transportation. Each represents about a third of regional greenhouse gas
emissions. How are we doing?
On greening the grid, we're doing as well as anyone in the nation. Aspen's municipal grid is 100%
renewable. Holy Cross is headed there. For years this change was considered impossible, but as a
community, we're almost there.
What about transportation? That's a very difficult sector to address, as you can tell just by watching
traffic at the S-curves. But the truth is, our valley is doing pretty well compared to peer communities.
Guests who fly in typically won't use cars. We have the biggest rural transit agency in the U.S. We have
bike-share for first and last mile travel. And our electric vehicle-charging infrastructure is admirable, and
expanding. There are, by my count, fifteen chargers just around Buttermilk and the airport.
On buildings, we're also doing well, with a couple of caveats. Most local municipalities  and in
particular Pitkin County  have advanced their codes over the last decade, ensuring that new buildings
are radically efficient. The problem is that even an efficient gas-heated building will still emit carbon
monoxide for its entire lifetime. We have this beautiful green grid  we should use it That means the
next step for our valley must include electrification codes  incentives to dump gas, and eventually
(gasp) a full ban. It's not that hard: Aspen Skiing Company just finished all-electric multi-story employee
housing in Basalt, our second project after the mid-valley tiny homes. TACAW's performing arts center is
all-electric. So is the Basalt Vista housing project and Electric Pass Lodge in Snowmass Village.
The real problem the valley hasn't solved around the built environment is that we haven't recognized
urban planning as a climate solution. Meaning that building location and character, density, how we
house people, how we access land  all influence emissions. Too often, ""environmentalism"" is
synonymous with ""NIMBYism."" (Not In My Back Yard.) Just think about the next proposed development
near you. The chorus is always: ""Too dense Not in character. Too high."" (Even if it's just a mother-in-law
unit, neighbors typically come out opposed.) Or you hear: ""We don't want growth"" But sensible density,
in the urban core, with access to mass transit, and with ample deed restriction, prevents traffic by
allowing people to live near where they work, cuts emissions and improves community life by creating
economic vitality andneighbors. Examples of what doesn't make sense: townhomes at the base of 1A.
Low density, high-end condos with only limited affordable housing in downtown Basalt; massive homes
that require huge services (see: traffic) and monster energy loads.
In summary, on climate action, we are doing great. But we can do better.

'WILL WE BE PREPARED?'
JOHN DOYLE
Aspen excels in many ways in the way it cares for the environment. I believe the common denominator
is the citizens who become involved, from our elected leaders to our grassroots organizations, from our
many nonprofits to our local educators, from the 5 Points Film Fest to the Aspen Institute. Aspen and the
Roaring Fork Valley are filled with people who care deeply about the environment, and as a result, we are
all better educated on the issues facing our planet, both locally and globally.
The late 1960s and early 1970s birthed an awareness about the balance between development and the
environment that gave us the rise of Joe Edwards, Dwight Shellman and Michael Kinsley, whose
thoughtful, brave leadership helped preserve a place like no other. Zoning laws they enacted have kept
Aspen from becoming another I -70 resort.
Aspen developed an open space program that has worked effectively to protect and prevent
development on some of our most treasured open spaces.
Due to citizen input and local leadership, the City of Aspen electric system uses 100% renewable
energy: 46% hydropower, 53% wind power and 1% landfill gas Our local electeds helped form CORE,
the Community Office for Resource Efficiency, which fosters renewable energy and energy
conservation. RFTA has several electric buses and more are anticipated. The plastic bag ban, started
here, has been implemented in many other communities.
Our community could improve in many ways in its care for the environment. Implementing a true
community-wide recycling and composting commitment would be a good start. Getting everyone,
including our many restaurants, to commit to composting is a worthy goal.
My understanding is that wildfires are currently our valley's most urgent environmental issue. Pitkin
County is the only county in northwest Colorado that didn't experience a significant wildfire last summer.
While I'm sure evacuation plans and redundant energy supplies are being looked at, it seems obvious to
anyone who spends time in our forests, that our forests are overloaded with fuel, and that substantial
forest thinning needs to be looked into, especially in the urban/wilderness interface.
Continued drought and more intense wildfires are predicted. Will we be prepared?
John Doyle will be sworn in as an Aspen city councilman on June 8. He stressed this is his personal
view, not a view of city government.
'TO A CARBON-FREE FUTURE'
MONA NEWTON
Community support for taking care of our environment is decades-strong in the Roaring Fork Valley. The
Utes who had summer camps here in the 1880s respected and revered our natural environment. Newer
inhabitants began to take notice of our need to do something about a changing climate in the 1990s when
global climate change began to feel real in this valley.
Collaborative and like-minded leaders founded the Community Office for Resource Efficiency (CORE)
with a commitment to sustainability that would keep our communities' economies strong, and create new
jobs. Since over half of our carbon emissions come from energy used in buildings, CORE works
primarily in the buildings space. Changing the energy usage in buildings requires an investment of
capital, time, human resources and sometimes a leap of faith. By collaborating with the City of Aspen,
Pitkin County, Habitat for Humanity, Ski Co, and many others CORE has been able to leverage
resources for maximum energy savings and carbon reduction.
Are we doing a good job caring for the environment with this work? Some days my answer is yes, some
days, no. There is just so much work to do. We continue fiercely tackling the hurdles and opportunities in
front of us  embracing new technology, work force training, equipment costs and on and on, whatever
gets thrown at us. Our eyes are trained to look over the horizon at what will be needed to reduce the
energy demand of buildings that dump carbon into the atmosphere and relying more on the sun's energy
to power buildings and transportation. And that isn't enough. We have to search out other opportunities
that will help get us to a carbon-free future.
Despite decades of hard work, the clock is still ticking. Our communities, together with other
communities, other nations are joined in a race to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions before it's too
late. We still have 9 years, let me repeat, 9 years, to reduce global carbon emissions by 50% from 2020
levels to reach Colorado's goal. This goal feeds into the global goals. That will be the mark when we will
truly know that we are caring for the environment.

'A HUGE CHALLENGE'
LISA STOEFFLER
The valley is excelling in fire and fuels management, but we need to improve
We on the White River National Forest are privileged to manage 2.3 million acres of some of the most
spectacular and diverse public lands in this country.
We benefit from the high level of support and advocacy from a very engaged public and community
partners in the Roaring Fork Valley. One very timely example is the large amount of support we receive
for our fire and fuels management.
Here in the Roaring Fork Valley, we've collaborated with many partners and local residents in recent
years to reduce hazardous fuels via prescribed fires in highly visible places like Hunter Creek, Basalt
Mountain and Braderich Creek. We have more burns planned this spring if conditions allow.
These carefully planned prescribed fires reduce fuels, help lessen the intensity of wildfires and provide
firefighters places to engage more effectively. They also provide a large benefit to wildlife habitat.
We partner with other agencies and organizations in the valley to fund these projects. We also rely on
them  along with nonprofits and engaged public in the valley  to help spread the word about how these
prescribed fires help us reduce wildfire risk, and how they are truly critical right now.
And while we have had these important successes, we need to do more. Much more.
Last year we saw the three largest wildfires in Colorado history and the largest fires in the history of the
White River National Forest.
These large fires are here to stay. More than a century of fire suppression has left us with a tremendous
amount of fuel that continues to build. We have thousands of homes in and around our forests, which are
getting warmer and drier. We must double and triple our efforts to restore ecosystems and reduce fuels.
We must become more comfortable with using fire to manage vegetation on the landscape, through
prescribed fire and, when and where appropriate, naturally ignited fires. We must do more with
mechanical and hand-thinning methods to reduce fuels and improve wildlife habitat. This requires
collaborative planning, funding and, most importantly, the support and social license of our communities.
This is a huge challenge and we cannot do it alone.
Lisa Stoeffler is deputy supervisor in the White River National Forest
'JUST, EQUITABLE, DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE'
WILL ROUSH
For over half a century, community activists throughout the Roaring Fork Valley have engaged in
generational work to protect the spectacular public lands that surround us. This work has required
perseverance, political and ecological expertise, and dedicated collaboration. Whether it's securing
designations for Wilderness and Roadless Areas, or cancelling oil and gas leases in the Thompson
Divide  protecting public lands is part of our ethos in the valley and something we should be incredibly
proud of and grateful for And it's an effort we know must continue. To address the dual climate and
biodiversity crises, the science is clear we must protect 30% of lands and waters by 2030 (a goal
commonly called 3030). Public land bills now under consideration, such as the CORE Act, are a great
start but more protections are needed; I'm confident our community will once again rise to the challenge.
One area for improvement is building a just, equitable, diverse and inclusive environmental movement.
By first acknowledging that the environmental community has systematically failed to engage and
ignored the concerns of people of color and low-income communities we can then work to both address
the injustices of the past and chart an equitable future. One way we can do this locally is by deeply and
authentically engaging the Latinx community. The valley's Latinx community has been here for
generations and makes up 30% of our population, yet our environmental community and priorities have
yet to reflect this reality.
Key to this work is listening and understanding both the priorities of the Latinx community and the
systemic barriers which impact everything from peoples' ability to access public lands and
environmental education to fully participating in the political and decision-making processes around
environmental impacts and benefits. Latinx engagement efforts by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of
Land Management, the exciting work of groups like Voces Unidas de las Montaas on advocacy and
civic engagement, and our 3-year-old Defiende Nuestra Tierra (Defend Our Land) program make me
hopeful, but much more work is needed. It is imperative and urgent our community will rise to this
challenge as well.

Anatomy_of_a_wildfire_How_fuel_sources_weather__Vail_Daily_CO___August_19_2020.txt,"nato my o f a wildfire : Ho w fue l so urce s, we athe r - Vail Daily (CO ) - 
On the surface, wildfires seem simple.
There's a spark, a few small twigs flare up, and it spreads throughout a forest landscape until it runs its course or is doused by firefighters. In the United States alone, we see it tens of thousands of times a year, from relatively innocuous burns deep in the wilderness -- that most people won't even hear about -- to violent blazes along the wildland-urban interface that can consume everything in their paths, leaving only scorched earth and melted metal behind.
But how exactly do wildfires happen, and what factors determine whether a fire will stay calm or burst into an unpredictable and uncontrollable force of nature?
In reality, the causes and effects of wildland fires are complex, rippling through a wide-ranging network of trees, brush and wildlife inside a forest and broadly impacting its ecology and biology. But to start, we'll look at the chemistry involved.
The flashpoint
There's an old saying that fire follows people, and the statistics back it up.
While fires caused by lightning and spontaneous combustion do occur naturally, almost all wildfires are caused by humans in one way or another.
""People don't like to hear this, but eight out of 10 wildfires are human caused,"" said Jeff Berino, former chief at Summit Fire & EMS and fire science instructor at Colorado Mountain College. ""That includes everything from downed power lines, particles from a diesel engine landing on grass, outof-control campfires or kids with matches. People often assume arson, but people do dumb things all the time and accidents happen.""
In order for an accident to turn into a full-blown wildfire, the environmental conditions have to be ripe, but to better understand how ambient conditions affect fire behavior, ithelps to break down the chemistry of combustion.
At a base level, fire needs three components to sustain itself: fuel, oxygen and heat. But instead of a single reaction taking place, there are thousands, even tens of thousands, of reactions to produce self-sustaining flames.
On a molecular level, fuel sources like wood are complicated, made up in part by lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose molecules -- essentially huge sugar molecules that have been interlinked.
""When you look at a piece of wood, what you're really looking at is essentially sugar that has bonded to itself,"" said Torben Grumstrup, Ph.D., a research mechanical engineer at the U.S. Forest Service's Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Montana. ""And just like glucose and fructose are
good fuel for us, those serve as fuel for a fire. And taking apart these extremely complex molecules atom by atom requires a huge number of different reactions.""
As a heat source moves toward a piece of wood, the fuel eventually will hit a temperature -- about 480-575 degrees Fahrenheit -- when the molecules begin to break off the main body, a thermal decomposition process called pyrolysis. As a result, a stew of gas made up of broken-off submolecules reacts with the oxygen in the air, producing carbon dioxide, water, heat and light.
""When you see flames, it's not actually the solid wood burning,"" Grumstrup said. ""It's actually this gas that's produced by the process of pyrolysis that's burning.""
Once a flame is born, there are three primary variables that decide how it will act: fuel, weather and topog raphy.
Fuel for fires
How quickly a fire starts and spreads is determined by myriad environmental factors, perhaps most notably the type of fuel and the moisture level inside.
""When you have a fuel -- grass, pine needles, logs, any woody biomass -- that's full of water, when the fire burns that fuel, it not only has to heat up the fuel to get to the point where the chemistry of combustion is sustainable, it also has to heat up the water contained in the fuel and turn it from liquid into steam,"" Grumstrup said. ""And that takes a surprising amount of energy because water is a really phenomenal absorber of heat.""
In other words, the less moisture content you have in a fuel source, the easier it is for a fire to become self-sustaining and to spread.
Obviously, precipitation and the relative humidity in the air are the driving factors behind fuel moisture, which is measured at fire science labs by taking samples of different sizes and types of fuels, drying them out in an oven and determining the amount of water that was present.
Different size fuel sources also vary considerably in how they react to precipitation and humidity, with larger fuels requiring longer time periods to adapt to changes in the atmosphere. Fire officials take measurements on one-hour fuel sources like grass (less than 0.25 inches in diameter), 10hour sources (0.25-1 inches), 100-hour sources (1-3 inches) and 1,000-hour sources like trees (3plus inches).
Officials also measure dead and living fuel sources, which can return moisture levels of between zero to 30% and 30% to 300%, respectively, meaning living fuels can hold up to three times their weight in water. As a result, the critical values -- when a fuel source is readily available for combustion -- differ widely in various vegetations. For example, a dead fine fuel source like pine needles might hit the critical mark at around 6% fuel moisture content while living sagebrush can hit critical moistures at 100%.
But the moisture and size of fuel is only part of the equation in a wildfire. Fuel loading -- the volume and density of fuel sources -- also plays a major role.
""It impacts fire behavior fundamentally,"" said Ross Wilmore, a former zone fire management officer with the White River National Forest and wildland fire specialist with the Greater Eagle Fire Protection District. ""The heavier the fuel loading, the more fuel is available to increase the fire intensity.""
As a broad generalization, lighter fuels (in the one- and 10-hour classes) burn and spread faster, while heavier fuels burn slower and with more intensity. The composition of fuel types, along with density, helps to predict the type of fire.
A grass fire will spread quickly, but there will be very little left burning in its wake. Meanwhile, heavier fuel loads might leave massive amounts of burning material well behind the front line of the fire and burn hot enough to produce embers that can float up to a couple of miles away under the right conditions and start spot fires around the primary blaze.
The weather factor
Other weather factors aside from precipitation and humidity also are key in determining how a fire will behave. The biggest is wind.
Not only does wind help supply a fire with more oxygen enabling the faster combustion of fuels, it also drives flames toward one direction, pressing the fire closer to the ground and enhancing how quickly heat is being transmitted to different fuel sources on the forest floor.
""Wind is the biggest driver of wildfires,"" Berino said. ""T hink of it like blowing on a campfire. It has the same effect of giving the fire more oxygen, but it's also pushing the fire toward adjacent vegetation and starting to preheat it.""
By the time a flame reaches the new fuel source, it's already absorbed a considerable amount of heat and is ready to combust.
Oxygen availability also affects how hot a flame burns and, in turn, what the fire looks like. With sufficient oxygen to burn up the entirety of a fuel source, wildfires can burn at about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit and will show a yellow flame and white smoke. Without enough oxygen to thoroughly burn fuels, wildfires likely will burn at between 1,100 and 1,300 degrees, with red and orange flames and darker smoke.
And while weather certainly plays a big role in predicting a fire's path, wildfires can create their own weather systems in extreme cases, including changing wind patterns.
If a wildfire breaks out in an area with a considerable fuel source -- heavy, downed trees that will burn for an extended period -- the fire is releasing a tremendous amount of energy. As the fire continues to heat up, the buoyant flow of hot gas creates a low-pressure area that draws in air from its surroundings.
""When fuels are burning, they are sucking in oxygen through the convection process,"" Wilmore said. ""You've got a low pressure area above the fire as hot air rises, and it creates a vacuum in the
area of the fire that gets filled by surrounding air. ... From both a micro and macro sense -- within a couple miles of the fire -- it can actually change the weather and alter wind directions.""
As the fire draws in ambient air from the sides, known as an indraft, a column of pyrocumulus clouds of particulate matter and water vaporizing from fuel sources rises into the atmosphere, creating a weather system capable of generating its own rain, hail and lightning, along with erratic winds.
""The bigger a fire gets and the faster it's able to burn, the more it is going to have a strong influence on the surrounding weather,"" Grumstrup said.
The slope effect
The final major contributing factor in determining a wildfire's behavior is the topography in which it's burning, and the most important variable in the landscape is slope.
Fire tends to burn more aggressively moving uphill. Similar to the effects of wind, steep slopes allow for the preheating of nearby vegetation. If a fire ignites on a mountainside, it initially will burn the same as though it were on flat ground, with smoke and flames heading straight into the air. But once the fire has established itself, the flames naturally will begin laying over toward the uphill side of the slope.
""The fire is trying to draw in air from all directions,"" Grumstrup said. ""But when there's a hill, the fire isn't able to draw in air from the uphill side, creating a gentle pressure from the wind coming in that pushes the flame to the uphill side. Just like with wind, when you have flames in close proximity to unburned fuel on the ground, it's naturally enhancing the rate of transmission of heat to that fuel. It rises in temperature faster, and it thermally decomposes and pyrolyses faster.""
The phenomenon is even more strongly apparent in canyons, where there are slopes on both sides, along with landscaping that can funnel wind directly to the flames. Called the chimney effect, a wildfire can induce winds from the bottom of a canyon through a convection current, pushing flames deeper into the hillsides.
The aspect of slopes also will impact how susceptible the area is to a wildfire, largely due to temperature and which areas are receiving direct sunlight.
""The hotter the ambient temperature is, the easier it is for wildfires to grow and spread,"" Berino said. ""The fuel is already heated up. If you're up here in Summit on a hot summer day, things get really hot in the direct sunlight. That's why north-facing slopes don't burn as aggressively as southfacing slopes. That aspect of the mountain is getting cooked all day and slowly heating that fuel up.""
This means that the time of day plays a role in when fires are most active, with fire danger typically peaking during the hottest and driest part of the day at around 2 p.m.
Altitude also affects fire danger. Just as humans have more difficulty breathing with less oxygen at higher elevations, wildfires are subject to the same effect.
A nonlinear problem
Fuels, weather and topography are the three main factors in determining how and why a wildfire behaves the way it does. But it's only in combining all three variables that we're able to truly assess the type of fire we'll see, along with how quickly it spreads and with what intensity.
There are three types of wildfires: ground fires , surface fires and crown fires . Ground fires burn up to a few feet underground in soils rich in wood fiber and can smolder for weeks or months until conditions are favorable to emerge to the surface.
Surface fires are the main drivers behind wildfire behavior, burning up available fuel sources on the forest floor. And in more severe conditions, surface fires can create heat and flame lengths significant enough to climb the ladder of branches and create crown fires burning along the forest 's canopy.
""The rate of spread ties back to all these factors,"" Berino said. ""If there is no wind, fires are relatively easy to jump on. But once you add wind, it makes it more complicated. And once you add slopes and a dry fuel package, then you have a recipe for a fast-spreading wildfire.""
But even when considering all of the factors, wildfires can be extremely difficult to predict as even the smallest changes in conditions can have massive effects on behavior.
""At around 2 p.m., when the temperature is at its highest and humidity is lowest, it seems like the fire will suddenly start burning very aggressively,"" said Grumstrup."" That's because of the inherent nonlinearity of fire, where a small change in input creates a huge change in output. Even a very small change in humidity, temperature or wind speeds can create big changes in the fire behavior and the rate of spread.""

As Colorado wildfires burn fears that climate change is caus.txt,"As Colorado wildfires burn, fears that climate change is causing
""multi-level emergency"" mount

The record-breaking forest fires burning in Colorado even as winter sets in are the latest sign climate
warming is hitting the West hard, causing scientists to up their rhetoric and warn it is past time to move
beyond planning and start aggressively acting.
""We've got to get motivated and stop turning the thermostat up. That is urgent, not a sci-fi thing. It is us
turning up the thermostat. It does not readily turn down. The farther we turn it up, the worse it will get,""
said Scott Denning, a Colorado State University atmospheric scientist.
Colorado and the West face more hot days and temperatures will shoot higher, scientists say. The rising
heat is depleting water and drying soil across the Colorado River Basin and other river basins. Last
week, federal authorities classified 97% of Colorado in severe to exceptional drought.
Mega-fires including 2020's Cameron Peak, East Troublesome and Pine Gulch are burning hotter and
longer, with record destruction this year of 700,000 acres in Colorado and 6 million around the West. The
smoke that exposed tens of millions of people to heavy particulates, health researchers say, will pose an
even greater risk to public health in years to come.
""We're choking ourselves to death,"" Commerce City teacher Renee Chacon, 35, concluded after closing
windows against the latest billowing gray-brown barrage. Her sons suffer headaches and she went to a
doctor with lethargy.
Signs that the effects of climate warming are here and hurting Coloradans have kindled urgency within
government agencies. Colorado Energy Office director Will Toor, at a recent climate forum, described
""very significant impacts happening much earlier than expected."" Colorado Department of Natural
Resources director Dan Gibbs, in an interview, said warming impacts over the next 30 years look ""very
troubling and, frankly, terrifying.""
Politicians including presidential candidate Joe Biden and Senate hopeful John Hickenlooper now refer to
""an existential threat"" and call for a shift off the fossil fuels they've supported in the past.
Yet efforts to help residents cope, and even draw down heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
by re-greening farmland and cities, have barely begun. A Denver Post examination found a $4.2 billion
backlog of forestry work identified by the Colorado State Forest Service as critical to protect people and
property from fires.
Owners of destroyed homes still typically rebuild on site, despite increased erosion and flooding. More
people moving into fire-prone forests between now and 2040 likely will triple the size of a high-risk
interface zone, according to a forest service report scheduled for publication next month.
Farmers are left largely on their own as water vanishes and crops wilt. Local governments still approve
urban expansion despite water supply strains.
""We are behind,"" Gibbs acknowledged. ""But we're doing a lot of things in the right direction.""
Escalating impacts
The heat that broke 90-degree day records in Front Range cities  75 days in Denver, 52 in Colorado
Springs, 98 in Pueblo  accelerated a statewide warming trend.
Colorado's average temperature has increased since 1990 by 2 degrees, faster than the global increase,
with temperatures in western Colorado increasing more, said Clay Clarke, leader of a four-member
climate team in the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment.
""And we will see years hotter than what we've had,"" state climatologist Russ Schumacher said. ""There's
very high confidence in the climate science community that this warming is going to continue and
because the atmosphere is thirstier in hot years, what moisture you have goes away more quickly.""
In cities, ""heat islands"" where surfaces are paved, absorbing heat and sluicing away water from rain and
snow, amplify rising temperatures by up to 15 degrees, researchers in Portland and Richmond found in a
recent national survey.
Developers this century took advantage of lower land prices in old, treeless neighborhoods and built
high-density luxury condos and shops  still without trees and parks. Denver has fallen behind other
major cities in creating open greenspace that keeps cities habitable. The city's chief climate officer
Grace Rink told The Post that ""we will be advocating for additional open space and more trees 
connected greenspace.""
Warmer atmosphere is thirstier
Across the Southwest, the rising temperatures are drawing down water supplies, especially in the
Colorado River Basin, where the crucial Lake Mead reservoir has dropped to 39% full and precious
precipitation vanishes before it reaches rivers.
Streams and rivers in the basin will lose about 4% to 5% of water for every 1 degree temperatures rise,
said Jeff Lukas, author of the 2020 Colorado River Basin State of the Science report done for Denver
Water, the Colorado Water Conservation Board and other water agencies. By 2050, stream flow will
decrease by 12% to 15% due to warming, he said.
A need to adapt became clear over the past 15 years as warming depleted water in the Colorado River
by at least 6%, said Brad Udall, a CSU water center scientist who analyzes federal flow data.
What's the rational response?
""Rationality means getting really serious about GHG (greenhouse gas) reductions. It also means
planning for the worst with respect to water supplies and fires. We're doing none of these things, although
the water community at least realizes the threat and is making some efforts to think about it,"" Udall said.
""Climate change is the ultimate 'kick-the-can-down-the-road' game. To fix it you have to have pain now,
and reap the benefits later. That's never a good setup for political action.""
Bigger, hotter wildfires
Dry conditions also set the stage for bigger, hotter wildfires. Eight of Colorado's 20 largest recorded fires
hit after 2018 and all occurred in the last two decades. And the three largest burned in the last three
months.
For three decades, forest managers have advocated  especially after big burn years  increased
forestry work such as thinning to let in more light and encourage species diversity, restoring natural
resilience. That way fires could burn without causing catastrophic scorching and sterilization.
But with more people building homes in the woods, land managers have been forced to snuff most fires.
A U.S. Forest Service memo this year declared an aggressive suppression policy due to COVID-19 and
air quality concerns, Colorado State Forest Service director Mike Lester said. A state forest service
report projects that, at current population growth rates, the housing and other urbanization within 3.2
million acres of forest will expand before 2040 across 9 million acres.
That report also estimates $4.2 billion would be needed to treat the 2.4 million acres where people and
property are most vulnerable.
""Because of higher temperatures, our fire season is getting longer,"" Lester said. ""We're never going to
have the money we really need to get this done. The irony is, we seem to have the money to put fires out
but we don't have the money to put our forests in a healthy condition. It is something we need to get
done.""
""The safety of our communities is at risk. Our water supply is at risk. And we provide water that leaves
our high country and flows to 18 different states and Mexico. All of Colorado is in drought now and you're
not going to hang onto soil if you've burned all the vegetation off of it,"" he said. ""It doesn't do any good to
say you're going to do something. At some point, you have to actually do it.""
Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control chief Mike Morgan said population growth and
development in forests will require better aerial capabilities to suppress flames and super-aggressive
""initial attack"" on any fire threatening homes  because small fires increasingly explode into
uncontrollable mega-fires.
""We're clearly seeing the number of fires and the size of fires continuing to go up. It will continue to go
up,"" Morgan said. ""And now this fire problem is everybody's problem with more smoke coming into
metro areas. We cannot ignore what is happening. We all have to chip in and do our part to reduce these
impacts.""
Worsening air quality
The bigger burning, in turn, worsens respiratory health as people inhale tiny particulates that lodge in their
lungs and clog airways, straining heart and lung functioning.
Multiple weeks and even months of exposure to fire smoke in cities will lead to ""increased respiratory
infections and mortality,"" said Emily Fischer, a researcher for CSU's program on air, climate and health,
who had just measured an Air Quality Index reading of 368  hazardous  in Fort Collins.
""The health effects are becoming more severe and widely felt,"" said Fischer, co-author of a 2018 study
that concluded deaths attributable to particulate pollution could double by the end of the century.
""The cause of mortality is not always known, but when smoke comes to town there's an increase. 
There's going to be a worsening of asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and
there will be more respiratory hospitalizations. Those are things that we know,"" she said, urging greater
efforts to prepare.
""If you have the means to do it, you should have an air filter in your home. But this is not a solution for
everybody. There are those who don't have a house where they can filter their air and create clean air
spaces  people who work outside, people who are homeless.""
""Laying groundwork"" to pollute less
State government agencies are trying to complete studies so they can better assess progress toward air
pollution reduction targets.
Colorado officials working with federal emergency managers also have launched an interactive computer
""Future Avoided Cost Explorer"" that lets residents calculate costs of damages under various climate
warming scenarios. For example, the damage costs from fires can be estimated at $440 million a year
depending on variables.
The idea is that damages could be minimized in the future with faster reductions of heat-trapping
pollution.
Similarly, the Environmental Defense Fund, NASA and others are launching a tool to help farmers,
ranchers and cities measure water consumption more accurately to protect the environment and sustain
future growth.
Colorado has nearly completed a statewide inventory that estimates emissions from multiple sources of
CO2, methane and other heat-trapping gases that drive climate warming. It will lay the groundwork for
enforcing tougher regulations.
Lawmakers have ordered cuts below 2005 levels  30% by 2025, 50% by 2030 and 90% by 2050.
Colorado's emerging strategy would meet those goals by requiring a faster shift away from gas-power to
zero-emission vehicles; closing coal-fired power plants; reducing methane pollution by the oil and gas
industry; and making the heating and cooling of buildings more efficient.
""We need to move fast, but we need to move right and we need to move carefully. We cannot impair the
reliability of the electric grid,"" CDPHE environment programs director John Putnam said. ""If we blow the
grid, nobody's going to follow our model. I would love to say let's get off fossil fuels now, but it just doesn't
work that way in the real world.""
But officials last week acknowledged growing pressure to prepare for and adapt to immediate escalating
threats. Putnam referred to ""a multi-level emergency"" as wildfires blew up.
""I understand the impatience,"" he said. ""I suffer from asthma.""

"As San Luis Valley's water squeeze intensifies, Gov. Jared Polis.txt","As San Luis Valley's water squeeze intensifies, Gov. Jared Polis mulls climate warming adaptation

CENTER  The sun beat down, baking Colorado's bone-dry, cracking San Luis Valley, where farmers for eight years have been trying to save their depleted underground water but are falling behind.They're fighting to survive at an epicenter of the West's worsening water squeeze amid a 20-year shift to aridity. Federal data this past week placed 93% of Colorado in ""severe,"" ""extreme"" or ""exceptional"" drought .
And Gov. Jared Polis was listening now, as a group of farmers sat around a patio shaking their heads, frowning, frustration etched on their faces  down by 150,000 acre-feet of water below their aquiferpumping target as the driest months begin. ""We're about as lean as we possibly can be. We've re-nozzled our sprinklers. Our pumping is as efficient as it possibly can be. We're trying different crops,"" said Tyler Mitchell, who had cut his water use by 30% after installing soil moisture sensors and shifting from barley to quinoa. ""But, at the end of the day, we have too many businesses that are trying to stay in business. I don't know how we can reduce pumping more than we already have.""
How to adapt to a hotter, drier world is emerging as a do-or-die mission for people living around the arid West. Polis was in the San Luis Valley on Tuesday, embarking on a potentially groundbreaking statewide effort to explore solutions amid increasingly harsh impacts of climate warming, including wildfires burning more than 300 square miles of western Colorado.
""It is about building resilience. It is about making preparations,"" the governor said as he bounced along a dirt road between stops in the valley, the start of what administration officials cast as a continuing drought tour.
Average temperatures will keep rising for decades, federal climate scientists say, based on the thickening global atmospheric concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, now around 412 parts per million, the highest in human history. Heat is depleting water across the Colorado and Rio Grande river basins, where more than 50 million people live.
Nowhere have climate warming impacts exacerbated local difficulties more than here in the Massachusetts-sized, predominantly Hispanic, low-income San Luis Valley between the Sangre de Cristo and San Juan mountains of southern Colorado.
Ute and Apache natives migrated through, sensing nature's limits. Spanish settlers set up small-scale farming in the 18th century using an intricate Moorish irrigation system. Modern commercial farming exploded after the 1950s, when economic development promoters invited production of potatoes and hay that led farmers to drill 6,000 wells and install 2,700 center-pivots to irrigate 120-acre crop circles  temporarily turning naturally soft-hued scrub terrain bright green.
But the pumping drained underground water after 1976 by roughly 1 million acre-feet, state records show.
This year, the winter mountain snowpack that determines surface water flow in the Rio Grande River measured 33% of normal in spring. Rainfall so far, 2.7 inches, lags at around 38% of average.
And the Rio Grande barely trickles, at 7 cubic feet per second, leaving Colorado toward New Mexico and Texas. Those similarly drought-stricken states count on shares of surface water in the river under a 1938 interstate legal agreement.
Colorado farmers' fallback habit of pumping more from the aquifers connected to the river  water use that is restricted under a locally-run, state-ordered conservation plan  has obliterated water savings painstakingly gained since 2012.
The 150,000 acre-feet draw-down this year hurled farmers practically back to their starting point. And a state-enforced deadline of 2030 for restoring the aquifer to a healthy level looms. If not met, state authorities could take control over wells.
Rio Grande Water Conservation District manager Cleave Simpson said recovery now requires a snowdependent gain of 680,000 acre-feet  4.5 times this year's draw-down. Gnawing at farmers' nerves, developers from Colorado's booming-yet-water-limited Front Range suburbs 180 miles away propose to buy up water rights from valley farmers and siphon away 22,000 acre-feet of water a year from 14 wells drilled 2,000 feet deep at the base of the Sangre de Cristos. This push by Renewable Water Resources, with former Gov. Bill Owens as a principal, would entail building a pipeline costing $250 million or more and pumping water northward over Poncha Pass toward expanding suburbs.
""A drier and hotter world""
Polis looked out the windows of a black utility vehicle and saw devastation spreading as climate warming impacts hit home. Hot wind churned dust around farms now abandoned and rented to newcomers struggling to get by. San Luis Valley leaders have estimated that low flows and falling water tables may lead to the dry-up of 100,000 irrigated acres, a fifth of the farmland in a valley where residents depend economically and culturally on growing food.
He saw farm crews toiling, coaxing the most from their heavy machinery, after flows from some wells had diminished and even reportedly pulled up just air. 
He said he sees different dimensions of problems around climate warming.
On one hand, human emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases ""are going up,"" Polis said. ""But, then, here in this world, it is about adapting to what is happening. I mean, the global effort needs to succeed. Climate change needs to slow down. Colorado is just a teeny piece of that  a fundamental issue affecting the entire world. America never should have pulled out of the Paris accords. I hope we return, and have a concerted international effort.
""But it is also a reality for how these farmers put food on their plate, for how their communities thrive in a drier and hotter world.  The same crops we have been growing, with one water and warm temperature profile, don't work with the way things are now.""
Colorado agriculture commissioner Kate Greenberg said state leaders also will hear from producers enduring dry times on the Eastern Plains, where wheat harvests are expected to suffer. Agriculture statewide ""is hurting"" and the San Luis Valley stands out as ""ground zero"" in a water squeeze due to low snow, shrinking aquifers, drought and competing demands from inside and outside the valley. Legal obligations to leave water for New Mexico and Texas compel cuts that complicate solutions, Greenberg said.
""Everyone who is working on this issue here in the valley still hopes there's a way to thread the needle. Of course, the state of Colorado has to protect itself legally and uphold their agreements in the interstate compacts,"" she said. ""How do we keep farmers and ranchers in business, keep agriculture as the driver of our economy, and use less water?""
Few of the farmers on the patio meeting with the governor saw much that state governments can do in the face of a possible environmental collapse.
Many have concluded that, as Jim Erlich said, ""we're going to be farming less here."" Some anticipated an agricultural landscape looking more like western Kansas.
But the farmers also saw possibilities. And they were sticking together for the most part in opposing the developers' plans to siphon water to cities.
Polis called climate warming ""the new normal."" He asked the farmers: ""Where does it lead? Do you see a way forward?"" State projections show conditions for at lest 15 years will be ""likely hotter and drier What does that mean in terms of crop mix? What does it mean in terms of sustainability? What does it mean in communities?""
The farmers, about a dozen, said they'll push ahead in the ""sub-districts"" they've formed to encourage saving groundwater  as an alternative to state engineer authorities controlling wells. They now pay fees for pumping and pooled funds can be used to pay farmers for leaving fields fallow. ""We do all that,"" Simpson said. ""And we still lose ground.""
An entrepreneurial businessman, Polis pushed toward what might be done to create better markets for crops, such as ""Colorado quinoa"" that use less water, giving a global perspective. ""I mean, agriculture does occur in dry parts of the world. It has to work from a water perspective.""
""Community is key""
Farmers getting by here have adapted, in some cases radically adjusting entrenched practices.
Hemp grower Dion Oakes stood by as late afternoon temperatures topped 80 degrees. Seven years ago, his family's water situation looked so dire thathe ditched potatoes in favor of hemp, which uses half as much water. Oakes harvested 3,500 acres of hemp last year and 1,000 so far this year  supplying factories in China.
U.S. garment designers led by Patagonia have committed to buy from those Chinese factories. On Tuesday, a gaggle of Patagonia promoters gathered with Polis in a hemp field, filming as the governor touted opportunities.
Oakes looked on. ""Our main reason to gethemp was the water use. We didn't know anything about hemp. All we knew was it uses less water,"" he said in an interview.
Patagonia's role creating a new market was playing out nicely. Oakes employed three workers on his farm, and another six at a processing facility  a capacity he said must expand.
Yet amid early signs of success, Oakes worried about dry times hitting too hard and driving other farmers out of the valley. Shutting down wells to meet the 2030 deadline, if that happens, ""is going to totally disrupt this valley,"" he said. ""It would take us out of here, too. Community is key.""
At another farm, Brendon and Sheldon Rockey showed Polis around. They've reduced their use of water from wells by 50% and prospered, growing 25 types of potatoes, shifting off water-intensive crops such as barley and planting more ""Colorado Quinoa"" along with a half dozen other growers.
Fallow fields fertilized with cows and planted with restorative ""cover crops"" help boost productivity by improving soil, Brendon Rockey told the governor. ""I don't have a mono-culture anywhere on this farm.""
As president of the potato producers' council and leader of a water-saving sub-district, Sheldon Rockey is encouraging other farmers  optimistically despite increased stress around the depletion of aquifers. ""We can still make it back,"" he said, ""if we have snow.""
Polis planned on listening more in the coming months. ""I'm impressed by the resilience of our farmers, finding a way to get through,"" he said. Some families had farmed for nearly a century, creating a vibrant, self-reliant culture.
""Hemp is part of the answer,"" the governor said. And he told farmers repeatedly thathe opposes water projects that require moving water out of one river basin to another, pointing to past cases where ""buyand-dry"" practices decimated Colorado communities.
Polis also suggested a relaxed state approach to the 2030 deadline for replenishing the shrinking aquifer.
""It is about the long-term trends.  whether goals are being met. There's nothing that would ever be done based on one bad year.""
The farmers were hanging on that.
""He is genuinely interested in providing what support the state can to help with our water balance challenges,"" Simpson concluded following this first meeting.
But ""farmers are frustrated,"" he said, emphasizing that aquifer recovery can happen only ""if mother nature brings snow.""
And Polis left with a more detailed sense of the stakes.
""What we wanthere is sustainability. That's why I oppose trans-basin water diversions,"" he said. ""But we have to make sure that farmers here today don't live at the expense of farmers here tomorrow and the next decade. This valley is about agriculture. If the water is sold off, or the water is used up, it will become a dust bowl."""
Ash raining down on Colorado a sign of hotter drier and more.txt,"Ash raining down on Colorado a sign of hotter, drier and more dangerous fire seasons

It should be raining in August, and last week in Grand Junction and Eagle, it was.
Raining ash from wildfires.
The ash was blowing into Grand Junction from the Pine Gulch fire, 15 miles north of town, thinly coating windshields and driveways and causing sore throats, said Alison Robb, Wildland Fire Management program director at Colorado Mesa University and Western Colorado Community College.
Flash-burned leaves that exploded into ash at the touch also made their way to town, said Dennis Phillip, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. 
""When you have ash raining down all night long ... the fire is burning way too hot,"" Robb said.
The ash in Eagle blew in from the Grizzly Creek fire that started in Glenwood Canyon, which was tamped down somewhat Thursday by some real rain.
For Robb, the Pine Gulch fire, the second largest in the state's history at 126,613-acres on Saturday, is more evidence of the climate change she's observed over 30 years of working on wildfires.
In the hotter and drier climate, fires move faster and get bigger and plants are stressed so they cannot resist the flames as well, she said. The firefighting season is also lasting one to two months longer, said Mike Ferris, a spokesman with the Grizzly Creek fire.
While the reasons behind the hotter, drier climate on the Western Slope are varied and the subject of much scientific research, the change in intensity of fires in Colorado is clear. The state's 20 largest fires in recorded history have all burned since 2001. This year, the Pine Gulch fire is achieving a new milestone by becoming one of the top five largest state fires after starting during the monsoon. The other fires in the state's top five  Hayman, Spring Creek, High Park and Missionary Ridge fires all started in June, which tends to be a dry month when fires are expected. 
Pine Gulch starting from lightning July 31 in a traditionally wet season did not surprise Robb. ""Summer after summer, we are not getting the monsoon,"" she said.
The hot, dry conditions are also unlikely to change dramatically in the coming month, said Russ Schumacher, Colorado state climatologist. But by starting later, the large fires should not burn as long because cool fall temperatures and snow will arrive to tamp them down.
Over the next week, the state could see some monsoonal moisture that could bring in cloud cover and increased humidity that could benefit firefighters, Phillip said. But the storms also bring potential for wind, lightning strikes and increase the risk of flooding on all the fresh burn scars, he said. In future years, western Colorado and eastern Utah are likely to see much more frequent hot and dry conditions because the region is warming faster than other areas, Schumacher said. Much of the Western Slope has warmed more than 2 degrees Celsius on average, Schumacher said.
The area is likely seeing higher temperatures because as the snow melts earlier in the spring, the ground warms more quickly. The heat then evaporates the moisture in the environment and, once the moisture is gone, the energy from the sun starts heating up the air, he said. These factors and larger global trends are likely contributing to higher temperatures, he said.
""What used to be a hot summer is going to be happening much more frequently in the future,"" Schumacher said.
Comparing extremes
While 2020 has seen the explosion of the Pine Gulch fire, it is not on track yet to be one of the most destructive in state history because no one has died and only one private cabin has burned. It was destroyed in the Grizzly Creek fire.
Conditions are nowhere near those in 2002, the fire season branded forever with Gov. Bill Owen's famous comment that ""all of Colorado is burning,"" and the year of the largest fire ever in Colorado history, the Hayman.
In April 2002, almost the entire state was in extreme drought, while in April 2020, some portions of the state had not even entered drought conditions yet and none of it had entered extreme or exceptional drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Since then much of the Western Slope, southern Colorado and the eastern plains have slipped into extreme drought conditions, but it has not gripped the whole state.
The extreme conditions in 2002, resulted in 926,502 charred acres in Colorado, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. As of Saturday, the four large fires burning in the state had consumed 184,288 acres.
Landscape shifts
Fire historically burned through forests in Colorado clearing them out. Ponderosa pine forests burned every 10 to 50 years, clearing out small trees, grasses and shrubs and leaving behind living trees to reseed the landscape, said Mike Battaglia, research forester with the Rocky Mountain Research Station. But many decades of fire suppression have left the forests far more dense and overgrown and severe fires are far more likely to burn through the tops of trees, killing them, he said.
After a severe fire it can take decades to centuries to recover and in some areas recovery isn't happening, he said. Even when trees are replanted, the conditions can be too harsh for the seedlings to take hold, he said.
Ponderosa pine forests in New Mexico have converted to shrublands dominated by Gambel oak, Battaglia said.
The landscape conversions are concerning, in part, because of the loss of habitat, he said. In pinyon, juniper forests, such as the areas where the Pine Gulch and Grizzly Creek fires are burning, recovery takes a long time because the trees grow so slowly, said Julie Korb, a biology professor and forest and fire ecologist at Fort Lewis College. A pinyon tree can be 12 inches tall and 25 years old, she said.
If islands of live trees have been left behind that can help the landscape recover, Robb said.Fire mitigation, such as mechanical removal of vegetation followed by controlled burns can help prevent severe fires, but it is more effective on the landscape scale, Battaglia said. It's more effective to treat 1,000 acres instead of a single acre, but it also needs to be done in strategic locations because of the cost to protect human safety, water and habitat and other resources, he said.
""It took us 100 years to gethere, it's not going to be fixed in two years,"" Battaglia said. An estimated 2.9 million Colorado residents live in the wildland-urban interface, which is susceptible to wildfires, up from 2 million people five years ago and those residents can take an active part in mitigation on their property, said Daniel Beveridge, wildfire mitigation program specialist for the Colorado State Forest Service.
""It is important for every resident to understand that wildland fire is an essential, natural process in Colorado's forest ecosystems, but a long history of fire suppression has altered historic fire cycles and led to the dangerous buildup of fuels in some areas,"" he said. Resources for residents can be found at CSFS Wildfire Mitigation and the Fire Adapted Communities Learning Network.

Aspen environmentalists reenergized with Biden taking office.txt,"It isn't far-fetched to say some Aspen environmentalists cried tears of joy when Joseph Biden replaced Donald Trump as president on Tuesday.
The staff at Aspen Center for Environmental Studies couldn't watch the ceremony together because of the pandemic, but they shared a sentiment.
""The mood was elation,"" ACES President and CEO Chris Lane said. ""We all watched the inauguration and cried.""
A photographer takes a picture of the namesake geologic feature in the Bears Ears National Monument in December 2017. Aspen-based Ecoflighthelped with the process that got the monument designated. Now it will help get it restored.
Scott Condon/The Aspen Times The canyons of the Bears Ears National Monument as seen in an Ecoflight flyover in December 2017.
Wilderness Workshop aims to seal protection for the colorful landscape of Thompson Divide during the Biden administration.
Trump kept environmentalists on their heels for four years. The administration shrunk the size of national monuments, rolled back methane emission rules, neutered the regulatory power of the Environmental Protection Agency and lowered fuel mileage standards for vehicles. Trump proudly withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement and dismissed climate change as a hoax.
Biden reversed course on numerous fronts in his first few days in office, including rejoining the Paris accord.
Veteran environmentalist Bruce Gordon, a founder of Aspen-based Ecoflight, said it is a relief to be able to stop playing defense even though he believes environmentalists ""held the line well"" during the Trump years. ""It will take on a much more positive and optimistic demeanor,"" he said.
Aspen Skiing Co. senior vice president of sustainability and community engagement Auden Schendler said Biden's personnel appointments show the direction the administration is moving on issues.
""The way to understand this is he's put climate people not only in climate positions but in all positions,"" Schendler said.
He believes it is particularly telling that Brian Deese, one of the top climate advisers for President Obama, was appointed by Biden as director of the National Economic Council.
""His top economic adviser is a climate hawk,"" Schendler said. Gina McCarthy, a former administrator of the EPA, will hold a cabinet level position in a post nicknamed ""climate czar."" McCarthy accepted an invitation by Skico and green groups to attend Aspen's Winter X Games in January 2015 while she was at the EPA to help spread the word on climate change. Schendler said her appointment to the administration bodes well to achieving goals on climate.
""The point is Biden isn't screwing around on climate,"" he said. ""This election was do or die,"" he continued. ""We don't have any more time.""
Lane said other Biden picks show a serious approach to social justice, an issue that ACES has become increasingly active in. Deb Haaland of New Mexico was the first Native American to be appointed as Secretary of Interior. Cecilia Martinez, a Latina environmental justice advocate, is senior director for environmental justice. Michael Regan is the first Black man to lead the EPA.
""That's new and different and progressive,"" Lane said of the diversity of personnel picks. Lane is also thrilled that an administration again will trust science. Trump picked appointees to suppress, water down or ignore scientific information, Lane claimed.
But just because a more favorable administration is in office doesn't mean environmental groups will rest easy.
""It's not like all the bad stuff suddenly goes away,"" said Will Roush, executive director of Wilderness Workshop, the oldest homegrown environmental group in the Roaring Fork Valley. He concurred with Gordon's assessment that environmental groups now will be able to get off their heels with Biden's arrival.
""It puts it much more in an opportunistic setting rather than reactive or defensive setting,"" he said.
Roush produced a laundry list of issues that Wilderness Workshop acts on that will be positively impacted by the change in administrations. Top among them is oil and gas leasing and development.
Biden put a 60-day freeze on the sale of oil and gas leases on federal lands. Existing permit weren't affected. A longer pause might be in the works as the administration prepares new rules for development on federal lands.
""I think it will have a big impact locally,"" Roush said. The regulation potentially affects lands such as Thompson Divide southwest of Carbondale, the North Fork Valley around Paonia and Roan Plateau of other lands in the lower Colorado River Valley, he said.
Wilderness Workshop is a key partner in a coalition to protect Thompson Divide and other areas. Roush said it will keep working for permanent protections. As it stands, The White River National Forest has prevented future oil and gas development through an administration action. But administration actions can be reversed and part of Thompson Divide is in the Gunnison National Forest, where there aren't protections.
Wilderness Workshop will continue to seek Congressional action to withdraw mineral leasing in Thompson Divide.
Another big opportunity is conservation of public lands. Congressional Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado have proposed the Thirty by Thirty Resolution to Save Nature. The goal is to conserve 30 percent of national lands and waters by 2030.
The Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act would play a big role in that national effort. It would protect about 400,000 acres of public lands in the state, including 200,000 acres in the Thompson Divide.
It would also establish Camp Hale, training center for the 10th Mountain Division, as the nation's first national historic landscape.
Roush is also optimistic about conservation efforts targeting Bureau of Land Management holdings. ""There's a lot of BLM lands in Colorado that haven't seen protection like forestlands,"" he said.
Conservation apparently will have to be achieved without the help of U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, the Rifle Republican who won the 3rd Congressional District seat in November. Environmental efforts aren't on the list of priorities she's outlined thus far (see related story). On the other hand, Roush said, Colorado gained another conservation-minded senator in November with the election of John Hickenlooper.
Boebert opposes Paris Agreement
U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Rifle Republican, co-sponsored a bill Thursday to prohibit Congress from spending money on the Paris Climate Agreement unless it is ratified by the Senate. President Joe Biden has said the U.S. will rejoin the agreement. Boebert labeled it a ""job-killing"" accord.
""Simply put, the Paris Climate Agreement places an economic handicap on the U.S. for generations to come while yielding no discernible benefit to the environment worldwide,"" Boebert said in a news statement. ""It allows bad actors, like China, to keep increasing CO2 emissions until at least 2030 with no penalty.""
Roush noted that the CORE Act passed the U.S. House twice even though Scott Tipton, the area's representative at the time, wasn't ""super supportive"" of the effort.
Skico's Schendler said environmental organizations and individuals cannot sit back and expect Biden to pursue action on its own.
""He, like all political people, needs a movement behind him,"" Schendler said.
Skico will work with Protect Our Winters to rustle up support for Biden's environmental agenda. ""We'll basically be the NRA on climate,"" he said, referring to the National Rifle Association, which has had legendary lobbying power on gun issues though now is facing bankruptcy and an uncertain future.
ACES, which tends to skip politics and focus on environmental education, will be consistent in its mission during the Biden years, Lane said. Part of that mission is seeking ""common ground"" among people on conservation issues.
""Everybody likes clean air, clean water and clean food,"" he said. For Ecoflight's Gordon, Biden's presence will mean he won't be ""waking up at night in a rage"" over environmental issues like he was with Trump in office.
One issue that Ecoflight will focus on is restoration of the Bear Ears National Monument to the scale approved by the Obama administration. Ecoflight worked for roughly a decade on the process that resulted in the monument designation. Ecoflight's specialty is getting decision-makers in the air for a better view of landscapes and to better understand issues. Ithelped bring together five Native American
tribes on Bears Ears issues and brought the climbing community into the fold. Other issues Ecoflight works on includes limiting oil and gas development on public lands and protection
of endangered species. Gordon said both issues benefit from Biden taking office. ""We're excited that protection of public lands will now get an opportunity,"" he said.
But without Trump around, will environmental groups be able to rally the troops or will the rank-and-file members become complacent?
Grant Stevens, communications director for Wilderness Workshop, noted that use and hopefully appreciation of public lands has soared during the pandemic, when other activities have been curtailed.
The challenge and opportunity is to channel that interest in public lands into protection of public lands, he said.

Aspen Fire strategizes for the future.txt,"After several months in the making, the Aspen Fire Protection District board of directors last week approved a strategic plan that maps out the department's goals for the next five years.
There are six main areas for development within the department, which has experienced some turmoil in recent years with low morale among volunteers and staff, as well as a change in its 140-year history that now has paid, career firefighters within the ranks.
The plan was developed after seeking input from community members, paid staff and volunteers via satisfaction surveys and a two-day retreat that was held in April.
After the strategic plan was presented to the board in May, changes were made to the document and ratified on June 8 with unanimous approval.
It is the first of its kind in the department's history and was facilitated by Sacramento, California-based consultant AP Triton for $20,000.
During the retreat, over a dozen firefighters and staff members established several measurements, timelines and accountability guidelines that the board will use to gauge whether initiatives are satisfactorily met.
""It's a floor-driven document and can lead the department through not just the next five years but hopefully set the stage for the next 25 years,"" said Aspen Fire Deputy Chief Jake Andersen, who came into the process as a new hire in March.
The board tweaked the department's mission statement to include the words ""professional excellence"" and the word ""safety"" was added as a core value.
""Everything we do is about safety but we didn't state it anywhere,"" Andersen said. The strategic-planning process is the result of an assessment of the fire protection district that was provided ESCI Consulting Inc. for $39,000 in May of 2020.
Among many suggestions for improvement, such as reducing response times and strengthening relationships with other public safety agencies, was establishing a strategic plan.
The assessment noted, based on interviews with heads of public safety agencies and local government, that relationships between Aspen Fire Chief Rick Balentine and surrounding organizations appeared strained and had resulted in limited interagency cooperation in recent years.
Revamping mutual and auto aid agreements between Aspen Fire and public safety agencies is one of the objectives Andersen is working on under the ""cooperative enhancements"" initiative.
""If you prioritize politics over safety we have a problem, so that is our response to the community, saying 'hey we want to be good neighbors,'"" Andersen said. ""We're doing everything we can to repair relationships.""
Results of the community survey show that a high number of respondents want Aspen Fire to prioritize emergency medical services.
But with the high level of service provided by Aspen Ambulance District, the strategic plan addresses how to heighten support for existing EMS response.
""We are better working together,"" Andersen said, adding that Aspen Ambulance District provides advanced life support care at a level that is unparalleled in most areas of the state. ""Aspen Fire Protection District's commitment to increasing our ability to support our local ambulance district will result in enhanced symbiosis with Aspen Ambulance and allow us to operate in alignment with the expectations of our citizens, elected officials and key community partners which were outlined during the planning process.""
With some tenured employees, both who are paid and those who are volunteer firefighters, have voiced their dissatisfaction with communication from administration at the top.
The strategic plan also addresses that, with Andersen spearheading an internal and external communications plan for the department under the ""organizational development"" initiative.
""We had some really open conversations (during the retreat),"" Andersen said. ""I'm already working on a couple of pilot projects to see if they work and will stick with people.""
The community will be surveyed more under that initiative, to establish what other expectations the public has for Aspen Fire.
The department's organizational weaknesses identified in the strategic plan include accountability, lack of direction, communication, management, staffing levels and perception.
Organizational strengths listed include quality of personnel, community support, training, dedication and passion from staff and the ability to change.
Threats to the organizations were identified as the cost of living in the valley, a decline in staffing, climate change and political influencers.
Initiatives, which all have between three-month and five-year timelines, are officer and leadership development; program development; capital assessment management; staffing; cooperative enhancements and organizational development.
Of Aspen Fire's 60 paid and volunteer firefighters and staff members at the time of the internal survey, 39 responded via an online forum anonymously.
When asked what their priorities are, 16% said leadership issues. That is the highest priority ranked in the survey, with the next top issue, officer development, at 11%. Improved communications was the third highest priority at 9%.
Firefighters and staff intimated through the survey that they also want more communication from the board.
One of the goals attached to Balentine's 2021 employment contract is the continued development of stakeholder relationships and external communications.
Board members have recognized that Balentine has had tumultuous relationships with those agencies for myriad reasons in recent years and were going to give him a six-month contract this year.
But at its March meeting, the board agreed that there were no measurements established to determine whether Balentine adequately met the goals.
As a result, the board extended Balentine's contract to the end the of the year to allow enough time for him to meet what are called his ""employment milestones.""
The board is scheduled to review progress on those goals at its July meeting.

Aspen officials elect to divest from fossil fueldriven corpo.txt,"Aspen City Council on Monday agreed to divest the municipal government's holdings in corporations that finance fossil-fuel development.
The move was at the urging of environmental group 350 Roaring Fork, which has specifically asked council to divest from Wells Fargo and Berkshire Hathaway through a petition submitted to the city prior to Monday's work session.
The city's ownership of corporate bonds in those two companies ""is inconsistent with the city's environmental values, not to mention its laudable efforts on climate change, to be invested in two institutions propping up and profiting from climate destruction,"" according to the petition signed by 172 area residents and submitted by Will Hodges, coordinator for 350 Roaring Fork. ""We are urging the city of Aspen to adopt a policy against investing in the financing, production and delivery of fossil-fuel energy.""
As council members directed staff to continue working toward an investment policy, they also agreed to divest its $3.1 million from Berkshire Hathaway when the bonds mature in August.
Berkshire does get a bad environmental score rating from the city's investment adviser, Insight Investment, which makes recommendations for investment and reinvestment of the municipal government's pooled resources.
Insight has a team of analysts who conduct research on environmental, social and governance issues for publicly traded firms and has been able to provide a scoring of the current corporate investments within the city's portfolio, according to City Finance Director Pete Strecker.
Based on that scoring, Wells Fargo ranks as a leader in the environment, which raised questions by some council members.
Strecker couldn't provide council with details on the criteria used to determine scoring, other than to show a slide that indicates carbon, natural capital and pollution considerations.
""It's important for us to know where these numbers are coming from,"" said Councilmember Skippy Mesirow, adding that the city ought to have its own criteria of evaluation. ""We know that (Wells Fargo) invests in extraction.  Divestment means moving away from investing in companies that take up fossil fuels and so this may move us in a direction of getting a little bit more divesting, but it is not getting us to divestment.""
Hodges said Wells Fargo is the second leading financier of ongoing and new coal, oil and gas projects, to the tune of $198 billion since 2016.
""It's ludicrous that Wells Fargo could be considered on the highest environmental rating,"" he said Monday afternoon.
The city has $2.9 million invested with Wells Fargo, with the bonds maturing in October 2022.
Councilwoman Rachel Richards said having city staff researching corporations that do billions of dollars in business globally to ensure that their holdings and subsidiaries align with the city's values is too much of a burden on a small team.
She asked that Strecker bring back more information about measures other government entities use to evaluate the ethics of their investments.
Council members agreed with Strecker's recommendation to consider reinvesting as corporate bonds mature to avoid a lower yield than what is currently guaranteed by the portfolio.
""I think that we should be moving away from Berkshire Hathaway,  and I think we can send amessage to Wells Fargo that we are watching their environmental and their social ratings and we will take that into consideration as we invest in the future,"" Councilman Ward Hauenstein said. ""Climate is on the brink.""
The city has previously elected to withdraw from corporate holdings that were directly tied to the fossilfuel industry, including Chevron and Exxon Mobil, according to Strecker.
""Both of these investments were eliminated from the city's portfolio upon maturity and are not being considered for future investment opportunities despite not having a formal investment policy tied to a greening initiative  so there are conscious decisions occurring at the staff level to ensure that the city's investments reflect the environmental values of the community,"" he wrote in a memo to council.
The city has roughly $140 million in investments, with over 80% in government agencies and bonds, as well as municipal bonds, all of which have lower yields than corporations. ""In some ways we picked up a little bit of yields for the public's funds when were able to invest in corporates,"" Strecker told council.
There is no scoring for U.S. treasuries or other U.S. backed investments, Strecker noted. Under the city's current investment policies, the three main considerations center around risk, return and liquidity.
Return on investment is always sought to be maximized but is never done without also considering how risky an investment is, and how long it will be held, according to Strecker. Mayor Torre said he also questions Wells Fargo's environmental ranking and wants more information on how the scoring was conducted and against what criteria.
""This is the start of a process, the start of something really great that I think the citizens of Aspen will support,"" he said, noting that Strecker will return with an investment policy related to the city's environmental values. ""I like the direction we are going, I like taking a step forward and I see this as probably two steps forward."""
Aspen Skiing Co donates 60000 to elect climate leaders in 20.txt,"Aspen Skiing Co. donated $60,000 last month to a political action committee that wants to mobilize outdoor enthusiasts to oust Congressional climate deniers, but the head of the company's sustainability department says other resorts need to do more.
Auden Schendler, Skico's senior vice president of sustainability and community engagement, said ""the industry as a whole isn't united"" behind the group Protect Our Winters (POW). ""There isn't the fire that this is the thing,"" Schendler told The Aspen Times recently. ""You've got a few leading actors, but look, this should be a five-alarm fire.""
He thinks many ski areas are stuck in whathe labeled the old-school model of thinking that reducing carbon emissions of their operations is enough action. He believes they need to make the leap to support national policy change.
Skico's recent contribution was to the POW Action Fund, which will target key Congressional races in six states this year to try to get climate leaders elected in November.
The efforts will be focused on Congressional districts in Colorado, Nevada, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Maine, according to the plan.
POW Action Fund will work to rally voters on climate issues in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, which includes the Roaring Fork Valley. Rep. Scott Tipton, a Republican from Cortez, is seeking reelection. He might not be unseated this election, Schendler said, but POW will aim to build momentum for success down the line.
""Truth is, Aspen Skiing Co. has been spending money against Rep. Tipton for years while Rep. Tipton has continued to protect our public land and water,"" Tipton's campaign strategist Michael Fortney wrote in an email to The Times. ""But it's their money, they can spend it however they see fit.""
The Action Fund is a sister organization and essentially the political arm of Protect Our Winters, which was formed in 2007. Its goal is to ""make action on climate change a top policy priority for the outdoor sports community.""
The POW Action Fund says its goal is to educate outdoor-oriented people about climate issues and how they can be part of the solution through voting and activism. ""It's what's really important this election cycle,"" said Schendler, who also serves on POW's board of directors.
The strategy involves more than a traditional ""get out the vote"" effort, POW Action Fund executive director Mario Molina told The Aspen Times. The idea is to educate outdoor enthusiasts about climate issues and turn them into ambassadors, he said.
The U.S. has an $887 billion outdoor recreation economy that supports 7.6 million jobs, according to the POW Action Fund's website. To harness the sleeping giant, the organization works with the most inspiring athletes, photographers, artists, musicians and moguls from outdoors businesses to deliver a message to outdoor enthusiasts and turn them into climate advocates.
""With the window to address the climate crisis closing, we can no longer simply rely on the traditional climate movement to help us in these critical elections,"" Molina said in the organization's 2020 Strategic Plan. ""We need to bring passionate new voters into the fold to build decisive, sustainable political and cultural power.""
POW Action Fund's strategic plan said it will strive to get a few thousand outdoor enthusiasts to the polls in key Congressional races to influence the climate debate. The targets are areas where a 5% to 10% voter swing can tip the district toward supporting climate policy. 
The Action Fund is trying to raise $1 million for its political agenda in 2020. It's about one-quarter to onethird of the way there, but contributions tend to increase as the political season heats up, Molina said.
He is looking beyond the 2020 elections. Effective political action groups have year-round influence even in off-election years, he noted, initially citing the National Rifle Association as an example, but then saying that might not be a good model.
""I think we need to move past the election-cycle mentality,"" Molina said. POW Action Fund has scheduled 150 events to educate people on climate issues prior to the 2020 election. Molina said the ski industry is ""moving in the right direction"" on climate activism but wants to do more.
""We'd love to partner with ski areas to reach their customers,"" Molina said. Skico has been one of the biggest supporters of POW from the ski industry. In addition to its financial commitments, it sends company executives on lobbying missions and to testify in support of legislation in Washington, D.C.
Skico held its Give A Flake flash sale Dec. 3 to 6 to benefit POW. Give A Flake is Skico's campaign to build awareness about climate issues. The company donated 10% of proceeds from the four-day sales of lift tickets, group lessons and rentals to the POW Action Fund. Over the past two years, Skico has raised $40,000 for Protection Our Winters and $60,000 for POW's sister organization, Schendler said.
Skico, Alterra Mountain Co. and Powdr Corp. stand out within the industry for embracing POW's efforts, Schendler said. He also credited National Ski Areas Association, a trade association, for its lobbying work on climate initiatives.
Alterra is Skico's sister organization. Alterra president and chief operating officer David Perry, former second in command at Aspen, was recognized by POW this fall for his support of the organization through lobbying trips to Washington, D.C., and participation on panels coordinated by POW. In addition, Alterra's Ikon Pass has been a ""POW Summit Level Partner"" at $25,000 annually for the past two years.
""One of Alterra Mountain Company's values is to protect our environments to ensure our future, and partnering with POW is one way we can support that ideal and an organization that shares that vision,"" Alterra said in a statement when asked about its philosophical reasons for supporting POW. Powdr Corp. bills itself as an adventure lifestyle company and owns several ski resorts.
Schendler said the ski industry is just a small part of the broader outdoor industry that POW is trying to engage. That includes everything from outdoor clothing manufacturers and retailers to outdoor recreation resorts to rank-and-file people that enjoy getting outdoors.
Molina said he is excited about recent efforts to engage climbers and trail runners to a higher degree. ""That will add thousands of people to our group,"" he said.

Aspen-area_fire_officials_bank_on_rain_to_ease__Aspen_Times_The_CO___July_14_2020.txt,"The return of afternoon monsoons to the Roaring Fork Valley cannot come quick enough for outdoor enthusiasts hitting dusty trails, gardeners coaxing plants along or especially fire chiefs fearing wildfires.
The monsoons typically appear in late June and continue into September, bringing frequent afternoon showers. They have been slow to appear this summer, but that might be about to change.
The National Weather Service expects a 20% to 40% chance of showers and thunderstorms starting later this week and continuing each day for at least the next week in the Colorado mountains, according to Jeff Colton, a warning coordination meteorologist with the NWS office in Grand Junction. He cautioned against expecting copious amounts of moisture.
""They are not going to be soakers by any means,"" Colton said Monday.
In addition, rain will be hit-or-miss for any given area, Colton said, and some storms could produce more lightning than rain. However, at least the weather pattern is favorable for allowing moisture to sneak up from the Gulf of Mexico after a dry start to summer, he said.
The forecast is welcome news to Roaring Fork Fire Rescue Chief Scott Thompson. The outlook has changed for the better in just the past week, he said.
The improved forecast plus data such as moisture content in living vegetation, known as live fuels for firefighters, will allow officials in the region from adopting more restrict fire rules, at least for now, T hompson said.
Pitkin, Eagle and Garfield counties as well as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management in the region are currently in stage one restrictions. That prohibits campfires outside of developed recreation areas. All fireworks are banned.
""Most people are in agreement we're going to stay in stage one,"" Thompson said. He doesn't foresee that changing any time soon even with a favorable forecast.
The fuel moisture level in live fuels isn't as bad as it was July 3, 2018, when the Lake Christine Fire broke out in Basalt, Thompson said. Fuel moisture levels are an important factor considered by fire managers when assessing risk.
""They're in inching down,"" T hompson said of the fuel moisture levels. ""It's getting to where it's concerning but it's not as bad as in 2018.""
Colton said the rain that is forecast isn't likely to break the grip of a drought affecting all of Colorado. The U.S. Drought Monitor issued by federal weather agencies July 9 shows all of Pitkin
County in moderate drought and the extreme western side of the county in severe drought.
The Drought Monitor stressed that the classification is based on broad-scale conditions and that local conditions may vary.
Aspen has managed to stay close to the annual average for precipitation through June, according to records kept at the Aspen Water Department's plant in Maroon Creek Valley. May was below average but June was slightly above average, thanks in large part to nearly 5 inches of snow June 9 (see related fact box).
""The last time we received any measurable snowfall in June at the Water Treatment Plant was back in 2005 when 0.75 inches was recorded,"" the water department's report for the month said.
Meteorologist Colton said the snowpack last winter was close to normal, but a lack of snowfall in late winter and an extended period of dry winds starting in May quickly ate up the snowpack. The same low pressure in the Pacific Northwest that has prevented monsoonal moisture to form for Colorado also is responsible for the drying winds, he said.
The dry winds, quickly disappearing snowpack and spotty rainfall have sapped the moisture from the ground. Richmond Ridge Road, which typically harbors massive mud puddles at this time of year, was bone dry Saturday. Trails throughout the valley have been pulverized to dust.
Aspen Global Change Institute has installed 10 field stations around the Roaring Fork Valley that measure ground moisture at various depths as well as precipitation and air temperature.
Sky Mountain Park in the hills above the intersection of Brush Creek Road and Highway 82 is showing soil moisture at the 8-inch depth at about 17% compared to about 14% at this time in 2018.
However, farther downvalley, the soil moisture is drier in some spots than in 2018. The soil moisture at Spring Valley near the Colorado Mountain College campus is at about 12% compared to 17% in 2018.
At Glenwood Springs, the average daily soil moisture at eight-inch depth is about 14 percent, the same as in 2018.
""It's telling me that conditions are pretty dry,"" said Elise Osenga, community science manager for Aspen Global Change Institute.

Aspens building code headed toward net zero.txt,"Aspen City Council is on the fast track to adopting a new building code that focuses on not only energy efficiency but also net-zero waste in demolition of old buildings and onsite renewable sources for new structures, among other measures.
The city's building code gets updated every six years and is due for one this year or in early 2022. While the code was forward-thinking in 2015, the updated one will be crafted to be in line with the city climate action plan, council members agreed Monday during a work session. Buildings are responsible for 58% of greenhouse gas emissions in Aspen, according to city officials. Between 2004 and 2017, natural gas emissions in Aspen were reduced by 3%, despite significant growth in construction.
That's attributed to the power of the code to reduce energy use. Considering the Climate Action Plan goal to reduce community emissions by 80% by 2050, the city's building codes are ripe for opportunity toward that effort, council members said.
Rather than wait for other jurisdictions to coordinate their building and energy codes, which would put adoption in the middle of next year as suggested by staff, the majority of council wants to expedite the work.
""A regional collaboration is super important, and I want to make sure we are engaged, but the climate is not waiting for their calendars and I don't think we should, either,"" Councilman Skippy Mesirow said. ""Let's do both, but let's act quickly and we do have a shot clock.""
Nick Thompson, a plans examiner in the city's building department, said there is some benefit to having consistent code adoption throughout the region.
It will have a greater impact on the regional climate-change efforts to have the most current energy efficiency codes in play in as many jurisdictions as possible, he noted.
""Giving ourselves time to do this right  because some of this stuff is a heavy lift  could be a little controversial, and we want to look toward what other communities are doing,"" Thompson said, also acknowledging that jumping ahead would mean fewer buildings built to a lower standard.
Council agreed that further energy savings and greenhouse-gas reduction can come in the areas of netzero construction, electrification and embodied energy. Thompson and Bonnie Muhigirwa, also a plans examiner with the city, explained that as officials look to the future, there will likely be a need to improve energy efficiency in buildings but there will begin to be diminishing returns for the effort.
So instead of reducing energy use to zero, the remaining energy is offset with onsite renewable sources such as solar photovoltaic, according to city officials. To avoid allowing inefficient buildings to just build a larger solar array to get to net zero, a minimum threshold of building efficiency could be established.
Councilman Ward Hauenstein said one way to reduce carbon is to put a cap on how much a structure can produce and limit square footage, which eliminates the inequities of rich people being able to offset their energy consumption by paying for it.
""Perhaps a building is allowed to be larger if it produces less carbon, and I think Boulder has a requirement that if a house were 5,000 square feet it has to be net zero, so something like that gains traction with me,"" he said.
Mesirow also said he supported downzoning residential homes and upzoning multi-family buildings. ""More large, empty homes are not good for our lived-in community goal, but they're really terrible for our environmental goals because those giant structures getheated all the time,"" he said. Council members also were in agreement that electrification can address the conundrum of a net-zero building creating greenhouse-gas emissions if there is fossil fuel combustion on site.
Electrification is transitioning appliances and equipment that would otherwise run on natural gas, like boilers, water heaters, stoves and clothes dryers, to clean and efficient electric versions using electricity sourced from a carbon free grid.
The city's electric utility grid is currently carbon-free, and the other electric provider, Holy Cross, has committed to being carbon-free by 2030, according to city officials. The full life cycle of a building indicates that there are significant emissions generated from the harvesting, manufacturing and transporting of building materials, and then from the release of carbon at the end of a structure's life when it goes into the landfill.
Council members said they want the city to up its game in curtailing construction and demolition waste, recognizing that it contributes to emissions and is shortening the life of the landfill.
""The net-zero waste to me is a really high priority,"" Councilwoman Ann Mullins said. ""Once that landfill is gone, people keep forgetting the impact that it is going to have on the city and the county.""
Council also agreed to add up to 45 electric vehicle charging stations around town in the next five years, as well as to begin next year charging a fee to users to cover the costs of electricity use.
The city currently has eight public charging stations, and staff is anticipating increased demand as more people buy electric vehicles.

As_a_sign_that_the_Cameron_Peak_Fire_is_fading___Daily_Reporter-Herald_The_Loveland_CO___November_9_2020.txt,"The Cameron Peak Fire, which has sat at the same size for a week and the same containment since last Wednesday, received another helping of snow Monday. And as fire activity diminishes, the U.S. Forest Service is opening up the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests.
The fire has stayed at 208,913 acres since Nov. 2 and 92% containment since Nov. 4.
The fire, which has been burning west of Fort Collins and Loveland for almost 90 days on mostly Roosevelt National Forest land, also has yet another management team in charge. The Northwest Incident Management Team 10 took over Sunday night.
Steve North, operations section chief, said Monday that whether crews will be able to engage the fire will depend on the snow.
Steve Ippoliti, incident meteorologist, said Monday morning that a low-pressure weather system was expected to bring around 3 to 5 inches of snow in the higher elevations of the fire, with some of the particularly steep areas getting possibly 6 to 8 inches.
""After this week we are going to see a warmup and drier conditions,"" Ippoliti added.
There still are some areas of minor concern on the fire, North said. The area causing the greatest concern continues to be the North Fork Trail slop-over.
As fire activity has diminished, the national forest has begun to open back up. According to a release Monday, the Forest Service planned to lift closures across the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests beginning at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
According to the release, closures will remain around areas that experienced wildfire in Larimer, Grand and Boulder because they present a public safety threat from potentially falling trees, hot spots and hazards hidden by snow.
""It will take us a little while to get everything open, adjust closure points around the fire areas and remove closure signs, especially with the snow falling,"" forest supervisor Monte Williams said in the release. ""We appreciate all the support we had during this unprecedented closure, and we ask everyone to be patient as our employees work to get everything ready for the public to return to our national forests.""
While snow did fall across the Front Range and the Cameron Peak Fire on Monday, the November weather outlook has remained warmer and drier than usual, according to the Forest Service release, so the potential for new fires to start still exists.
Accordingly, a Stage 2 fire ban will remain in place across all of the Arapaho and Roosevelt
National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland. A Stage 2 ban means no open flames are allowed. This includes charcoal grills, outdoor wood stoves and fire pits, but gas-powered cooking stoves with an on-off switch are permitted.
""We understand that it's cold out there, and folks who are camping and hunting at this time of year really want to have a warming fire ,"" Williams said in the release. ""But the potential for a new fire start hasn't gone away, and we really need folks to honor these strict fire restrictions.""
Further information on closures and restrictions can be found at fs.usda.gov/arp.
As crews begin the process of repairing the land affected by suppression tactics, the number of firefighters has been reduced. At this point in managing a fire, many in the community wonder why there are crews still in the area at all, North said.
""We still have a lot of moving pieces out there that need to be managed,"" he said. ""It is very important that we put this fire to bed and that we manage the land so we make sure we don't have big erosion problems and we can put the fire area back, as much as we can, to its natural state so it can recover from this fire in the long term.""
The number of people working on the fire has been reduced by half since last week, from 1,202 on Nov. 2 to 599 as of Monday.

November 15, 2020  Daily Reporter-Herald, The (Loveland, CO)  Jackie Hutchins
Snow and windy conditions Saturday prevented crews working on the Cameron Peak Fire from continuing with the repair work they did on Friday.
Steve North, operations sections chief for Pacific Northwest Team 10 said in a Saturday morning Facebook update that crews would use the time for training and rest ""so that when the weather does improve, we can get our foot back on the gas and complete this work to remove the hazards that are out there and to repair the fire area.""
Winds in excess of 70 mph and 4-8 inches of snow were predicted in the fire area.
Fire managers cited the risk of frostbite and driving high profile vehicles in dangerous wind conditions as safety concerns, but added firefighters were ""ready and available to engage flare ups do occur.""
With the fire remaining at 208,913 acres and 92% containment, crews have focused in recent days on repairs to areas where fire lines were built.
Repair work underway
Liaison officer Shawnee Hinman reported in a Friday night community meeting on Facebook that the suppression repair team had received many reports of where repairs are needed on private land.
""We want to let you know the team is now fully engaged in doing that suppression repair work both on public and private land throughout the area.
""We'll continue to do that work on private land up until the point that the county sheriff takes back over command of that operation in the coming days,"" he said.
Suppression repair focuses on repairing the manmade damage caused by firefighting operations, he said, such as dozer lines and hand lines.
Hinman added there is also damage caused by the fire itself, something a Burn Area Emergency Response team is working to assess.
He said that crew had been out in September and did an initial assessment, and has returned to do more assessment, and will turn over a report to the U.S. Forest Service in about a week.
Protecting the watersheds will be a focus of that plan.
Hinman said fire managers know there is fire damage on private land too, and Larimer County will help coordinate that recovery work.
Challenging fire season
On Saturday 415 firefighters were assigned to the fire, down from more than 1,000 at the height of the fire.
As the Pacific Northwest Team 10's time on the fire winds down, fire managers also talked at the community meeting Friday night about the long and challenging fire season they've seen.
""This has been quite the summer,"" North said.
Pacific Northwest Team 10 has managed six fires since June, including four over 100,000 acres, he said.
""It's an honor and a pleasure to be here in Colorado to help you recover from this fire.""
Incident commander Al Lawson also spoke to the community on behalf of the team.
""The whole hallway is lined with thank you letters, posts, etc., etc., we're seeing things online -- the outpouring of gratitude for all the teams that have been here has been outstanding, and we're no different. Consequently I'd also like to reach out to the community and thank you guys.""
Lawson said the community provided help, assistance and motivation that was important for the firefig hters.
""It's tough,"" he noted ""We're away from our families, most of us have been out on an incredibly long summer into fall. None of us would have expected when we started in June that we'd be here in November still fighting fires, an incredibly unusual fire season.""
The team has been out on six fires, 21- to 26 day-fires, back to back, Lawson said.
""Like you, we're fatigued, we're fatigued with fire as well. The reason that we're here is to bring some normalcy back to your lives. That's our highest priority.""
Adapting to COVID-19
Lawson also discussed COVID-19. One of the outbreaks in Larimer County is among Cameron Peak firefighters.
He said as an incident commander he loses sleep over public and firefighter safety, and COVID-19 has been a challenge thathe described as dealing with an unknown enemy.
""We're mitigated it to the best of our abilities, but just like the public we've had our challenges, including this fire,"" he said.
Lawson said COVID-19 has affected the ability of fire teams to fight fires, ""but we've been able to adapt to it. I'm hopeful that the 2021 fire season it will be a different story, but we're going to continue to take it seriously.""
The Cameron Peak Fire started Aug. 13. The estimated containment date is now Nov. 22.
The cause remains under investigation.

As_Colorados_pine_beetle_fades_whats_next_for__Durango_Herald_The_CO___June_4_2021.txt,"Colorado's forests have been waging a losing battle against tree-killing beetles for more than 15 years. Now, after marching across the state and killing millions of acres of pine forest , the burrowing, fungus-spreading mountain pine beetles are slowly losing steam.
While other beetles have thrived in Colorado's drought-ravaged mountains, the mountain pine beetles have reigned as the state's most nefarious pest. But the mountain pine beetle epidemic was always going to end, as there are only so many ponderosa and lodgepole trees in the 3.3 million acres affected by the tree-killing insects in Colorado.
And with that decline, a timber industry that has thrived on a once seemingly endless flow of dead pine trees is transitioning to new types of timber and logging.
This also means the end is near for the coveted blue-stained wood the pests leave behind. They spread a fungus in trees, leaving a distinctive blue hue that has made beetle-kill lodgepole a highvalue wood for cabinetry, paneling and trim work.
David Sitton's Aspen Wall Wood mill in Dolores transitioned from pure aspen paneling to mostly beetle kill almost 20 years ago. Now he's preparing to transition back.
""That blue stain, it will be a relic at some point,"" said Sitton, who bought the Aspen Wall Wood mill in 2016.
'Compounding disturbances'
The march of mountain pine beetles through Colorado's forests changed the composition of the state's woodlands. Aspen, spruce and Douglas fir have thrived in areas where beetle-kill lodgepole was harvested by loggers who supported sawmills like Sitton's. It's not likely the state will see a resurgence of lodgepole anytime soon.
A lodgepole pine typically begins dropping cones to seed a new generation of trees after about 15 years of growth. The Cameron Peak and East Troublesome wildfires last fall scorched hundreds of thousands of acres of about 15-year-old lodgepole, just as the young trees were ready to begin reproducing .
That's what scientists call ""compounding disturbances.""
""Those fires , that was a double whammy for lodgepole,"" said Brett Wolk, assistant director of Colorado State University's Colorado Forest Restoration Institute. ""It's not an extinct species, but the decline in lodgepole is accelerating the change in our forests. It's just another indication of climate change and compounding disturbances and how things are happening quicker than we ever anticipated. Everything is changing a lot faster.""
A sawmill's proximity to an outbreak largely determines the profitability of logging, transporting and milling the salvaged trees.
The longer a dead lodgepole or spruce stands unharvested, the less viable it becomes for lumber. After a decade or so, the standing dead trees start to rot, making them likely to break when they are logged, de-limbed, loaded onto trucks or processed at sawmills. A lodgepole can last longer, but spruce tends to spiral-crack after several years, making it useless for lumber.
The breakage makes salvaged timber less valuable, as logging companies and timber mills get less usable wood per acre. But new acres are being affected by a host of insects that flourish in drought conditions.
""I'm not sure we will ever run out of beetle kill, really,"" said Molly Pitts, executive director of the Colorado T imber Association, which has 56 members, including loggers, sawmills, truckers and other companies. ""We just won't see it in that volume we had before.""
Some sawmills are phasing out mountain pine beetle-kill production and transitioning to more live trees. But there are a few years of other beetle kill left. The spruce beetle is continuing its more constrained but still deleterious sweep across southern Colorado. Spruce beetles have killed about 1.9 million acres of trees since 2000, affecting about 41% of the state's spruce and fir forests.
But the number of trees killed by the spruce beetle in Colorado has been declining for the past five years. The damage is still evident, though. Engelmann spruce trees in the Rio Grande and San Juan national forests  fighting through a sustained, 20-year drought  are under attack by spruce beetles, making the insect a top priority for state and federal forest guardians. The spruce beetle affected 25,000 new acres of Engelmann in Colorado in 2019. And in recent years, the roundheaded pine beetle has been attacking the region's ponderosa pines, impacting 22,000 acres in 2019.
The exceptionally dry winter will likely spike beetle kill in southern Colorado this summer, Pitts said.
""We anticipate quite an uptick in beetle outbreaks down there,"" she said.
The Montrose Forest Products sawmill in 2018 announced a $21 million upgrade so it could process as much as 20 million more board feet a year of ponderosa pine from the San Juan National Forest . The sawmill, which has traditionally produced studs, beams and structural lumber for framing houses, is moving away from beetle kill.
The beetle-kill lodgepole from north of Interstate 70, as well as dead spruce in the Rio Grande and Gunnison national forests, ""is just not economical anymore,"" said Tim Kyllo, resource forester for Montrose Forest Products, noting his mill's distance from impacted forests as well as the increasingly fragility of long-dead trees.
The state has moved from the epidemic stage of beetle infestation  where large numbers of trees were being killed across pretty much the entire state  to an endemic stage, where the pests are still killing, but at a slower rate and in smaller geographic areas.
The Montrose sawmill is expanding into harvesting and processing green timber off federal land. The mill's $21 million, 2-year-old planer can cut up to 44 million board feet of logs every year. In the past decade, almost all those trees would be beetle-kill Engelmann spruce, lodgepole and subalpine fir, all cut into structural boards. The new planer will cut more ponderosa pine  harvested live, not salvaged  into 1-inch boards for nonstructural uses like trim, cabinets and decking .
""We knew there would be a shelf life for dead timber. Had the beetle continued moving in the epidemic stage, we would still be involved in that salvage work, but now there's nothing in it,"" said Kyllo, who has five logging crews working in San Juan, Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, Gunnison and Rio Grande national forests, all but one harvesting live trees.
Impacts on the timber industry
Beetle-ravaged trees fed an industry that is slowing and adjusting business plans as the beetles wane.
The Forest Service is focused on foresthealth, and thinning forests is a critical tool in lessening the severity and spread of wildfire while increasing the diversity of tree species. Most logging in Colorado is done on federal land, so the state's timber industry relies largely on federal logging contracts and timber sales to operate. Those contracts ebb and flow in changing political climates. In other areas of the country, like the South, timber is harvested from private land in fertile areas where trees grow faster.
So as lumber prices explode this year under record demand for new homes and a pandemicslashed labor pool, it makes more sense to build new sawmills  or open dormant mills  down South.
""It can be risky to build a new facility in Colorado,"" Kyllo said.
""There may be a desire to expand right now ... but capital investment in mills is expensive and you are not going to build a new sawmill based on what is being offered in this state,"" the timber association's Pitts said.
The Forest Service's aggressive clear-cutting of beetle kill, in addition to burning and thinning forests to slow the pests, has reduced the flow of blue-stained wood, but Dolores sawmill owner Sitton still expects five, maybe even 10 more years of supply.
If he had to transport beetle-kill across the state, though, he would be cutting the blue stain from Aspen Wall Wood's offerings. (The spruce and roundheaded beetles do not leave spruce stained blue like lodgepole killed by mountain pine beetles.)
When he cuts trees into 1-inch boards, he creates a decent amount of waste, usually 20% to 30% of the tree.
""Being righthere, so close to the trees, we can afford that waste factor. We could not if we had to add freight to the equation,"" he said.
The beetle epidemic has been calamitous for Colorado's forests, but Sitton sees an upside, beyond his ability to expand his business on the dead timber.
""It's devastating to see the impacts of the beetles, but the flip side is that they have put more focus on foresthealth,"" he said. ""So there is a silver lining in there. And a blue one, too, I guess, right?""

As_containment_approaches_50_percent_Grizzly__Vail_Daily_CO___August_26_2020.txt,"o ntainme nt ap p ro ache s 50 p e rce nt, Grizzly - Vail Daily (CO ) - August 26, 2020
In his final address to those following the Grizzly Creek Fire , Jeff Surber with the Great Basin Incident Management Team said there has been much success containing the fire in recent days.
Surber and the Great Basin team facilitated a routine transfer of management on the fire to the Alaska Interagency Incident Management Team on Tuesday; Surber said as that team takes command on Wednesday, they expect containment levels will be near 50%.
The Grizzly Creek Fire, which started August 10 and has burned 32,060 acres, now appears to be ""in mighty good shape,"" Alaska team Incident Commander Tom Kurth told the community in a Facebook live broadcast on Tuesday.
""Our job is to organize the nearly 800 individuals here, and then we build them into a daily plan, keep them and you safe, protect your homes and community , your utility infrastructure, keep the roads and highways open, assist initial attack, and then build upon the work that this Great Basin team has left us with,"" Kurth said.
The Great Basin team ""has built certain expectations here,"" Kurth added. ""Work-wise, informationwise, and certainly working with cooperators here. So if we overlook something, let us know and we'll provide corrective behavior here.""
Dangerous areas remain
Surber said as the Alaska team attempts to wrap up the fire, challenges could occur in containing certain areas where the risk of standing dead trees, or snags, make it dangerous for firefighters to fight the fire on the ground. The Great Basin team has set up alternative plans to deal with those areas.
""We're kind of letting things take their own course in there, keeping people watching it, so if it tries to escape, we can jump on it and take action,"" Surber said.
For these areas, where wildfires can smolder for weeks before popping up again, Surber offered a warning .
""My understanding is they've had fires here that they've considered contained, or that they've pretty much laid down for a month, and then the fuel continues to dry out into September or even October, and an edge like that will have one tree fall over and then what happens is that fuel that's not ready to burn now -- we can't light it on fire because there's just enough fuel moisture not to carry fire well, but in another month, if you don't get rain, it will burn readily.""
Surber said a pre-constructed contingency fire line further up the slope, from where fighters can keep tabs on the snag-heavy areas, will prove helpful in those areas in the coming weeks.
""It's a watching game,"" Surber said. ""Or, if you get to the point where you have a big wind storm -- 50 mile-per-hour winds -- and everything blows down, and they start feeling comfortable that the weak trees all blew over already, they might walk in there.""
Rain possible
Surber said rain could also affect the outcome of certain areas of the fire in the days to come.
While the fire burned on the west side of Eagle County on Tuesday, the east side of the county enjoyed downpour conditions for about an hour.
Meteorologist Kris Sanders with the National Weather Service in Grand Junction said similar rainstorms could pop up over the next few days, but areas of higher elevation than the Grizzly Creek Fire are likely to see more rain.
""We've had a lot of moisture, some of this high pressure that's been meandering around the Four Corners region, so we just happened to be in a good fetch over the past couple of days, where moisture has been moving into the area,"" said Kris Sanders with the National Weather Service.
The storms have been accompanied by lightning, which has created spot fires in the area in recent days. The most recent suspected lightning fire occurred on Tuesday northeast of Rifle, said White River National Forest Deputy Forest Supervisor Lisa Stoeffler.
Stoeffler said the new fire is roughly 5 to 10 acres in size.
""We have ground crews on it, and helicopters on it, and expect that they are going to pay attention to that through the evening,"" she said. ""We'll chase after those lightning fires as they pop up, and use the team as available to help us with that.""
Stoeffler also urged locals and visitors to be extra cautious with fire .
""T hings are tinder dry and resources are stretched way too tight to be dealing with another fire,"" she said.

As_firefighters_make_progress_East_Troublesome__Gazette_The_Colorado_Springs_CO___October_23_2020.txt,"After having to mostly stand by and watch as the East Troublesome fire surged into a 188,079acre behemoth that forced thousands from their homes, officials on Friday reported the first progress in days. They also reported the first two deaths.
In a video Facebook posting late Friday, the Grand County Sheriff's Office announced that that Lyle Hileman and his wife Marylin, 84, both died in their home near Grand Lake on Thursday.
Earlier, in a Friday evening briefing, incident commander trainee Dan Quinones said the improved conditions allowed the use of air resources for the first time.
""The smoke is cleared out, the winds have died down, we did not have fog or visibility conditions,"" he said.
""We had two heavy fire days, which showed extensive growth,"" he said. ""We had a real pleasure day today in not seeing that behavior.""
Friday night, the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the area, with strong winds and low humidity forecast for Saturday. But afterward, about 7 inches of snow could come to the aid of firefighters on Sunday.
Quinones said the coming days would be critical in slowing the fire. He said the wind Saturday in advance of the snowstorm could hinder efforts, but crews are ""highly optimistic on what we've done.""
The fire grew 17,493 thousand acres Friday, with containment at 5%. Only a small portion of the fire's west side remained under control, said Noel Livingston, fire incident commander .
Part of the fire's growth included a spot fire that crossed the Continental Divide to the east and reached Estes Park. The area, called the T hompson Zone, will be managed by the Cameron Peak fire's response team due to the difficult access to the terrain, Livingston said.
Firefighters on the East Troublesome fire concentrated again on protecting lives and buildings.
Thousands of residents have been evacuated, including the towns of Grand Lake and Estes Park. Rocky Mountain National Park, a destination spot for tourists and locals alike, was closed Thursday as the fire spread across its boundaries, said Stan Hilkey, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety.
The town of Granby remained on pre-evacuation status Friday, Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin said.
Even though evacuations in these areas are mandatory, law enforcement and first responders
cannot force people to leave their homes or the area. Some residents ignored the orders to drive through neighborhoods to check on damage to their properties, interfering with firefighters, Schroetlin said.
""We are asking people not to do that,"" Shroetlin said, adding that social media posts are contributing to misinformation about fire damage and activity.
However, Schroetlin said he could not provide information about the extent of the damage yet because officials are still trying to gather information.
Scott Headrick, manager of U.S. forest Service tanker base in Broomfield, along with several other officials briefed Gov. Jared Polis on Friday morning at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport about the ability to provide air tankers to drop retardant and water on the flames.
He told The Denver Gazette the wet weather expected this weekend plays a crucial role in taming wildfires.
""Mother Nature is what's going to put these fires out. When they get this big, Mother Nature's the one that's going to play that role,"" Headrick said. ""But you need continually sustained moisture. Cameron Peak had a foot of snow on it in September, and it still has gone to the size it's gotten.""
At the Loveland briefing, Dan Dallas, the fire incident commander for the Rocky Mountain Type 1 Incident Management Team, said fire response strategies need to adapt to changing conditions that exacerbate wildfire risk and lead to longer fire seasons, such as more extreme hot and dry periods. For one thing, he said elite Hotshot crews, or firefighters that respond to priority fires , have typically been available April through September.
""I would offer that in 2020, we call this 'The Big Learn.' We need to take everything that we've done, everything that we've learned, and try and adjust ourselves to a new reality.""
But Dallas added firefighting crews have improved response strategies after the 2012 High Park fire, which burned in Roosevelt National Forest west of Fort Collins.
He said he has received rapid responses from ""surge"" teams, firefighters from local departments around the state sent to help.
At his news conference, Polis said that Colorado's increasing population and land use has contributed to wildfire risk. The East Troublesome fire is believed to be human-caused, he said.
Polis said the factors exacerbating wildfires are ""something Colorado needs to plan for, because it isn't changing.""
It wouldn't be a news conference in 2020 without mentioning the COVID-19 pandemic, and Polis urged people who have respiratory symptoms to get tested for the disease rather than assuming air quality issues from the fires are causing their symptoms.
""If you're experiencing a cough, sore throat, respiratory issues, you may in normal circumstances
when we're not in a pandemic just think that's the fires . And it may very well be the air and the fires ,"" Polis said. ""But it also may be coronavirus, given how rampant that is in our state. Please get tested if you're experiencing any respiratory symptoms.""

Long after the smoke clears out of the valley and the flames are all extinguished, we will still be living with the impacts of the Grizzly Creek Fire .
""We know that after a fire, depending on how hot it burns, you have elevated risk of debris flow,"" said Eagle County Emergency Management Director Birch Barron. ""The fire goes away and you think you are safe. But the risk still exists.""
For the next couple of years -- and maybe as long as the next decade-- debris including ash, soil and burned vegetation will slough off hillsides in the burn area. As those materials slide down the steep hillsides in Glenwood Canyon, they will bring boulders along. Those are hardly ideal conditions for Interstate 70 operation.
""A normal rainstorm can lead to a lot more debris flow downstream when it comes to a burn scar,"" Barron said. ""I was in the canyon a lot during the fire and you see rock tumbling down all the time.""
A team from the U.S. Geological Survey, along with a U.S. Forest Service Burn Area Emergency Response team has already completed an initial assessment of the Grizzly Creek Fire area. According to David Boyd, public affairs officer for the White River National Forest Supervisor's Office, the BAER team will do more extensive analysis next week.
The teams' initial analysis map outlines large swaths of land where debris flow is likely.
""We will be looking at how to do mitigation. In a place like Glenwood Canyon, given how steep it is, we may be limited as to what can be done,"" Boyd said.
Subject to future closure
According to Elise Thatcher, the regional communications manager for the Colorado Department of Transportation, motorists should be prepared for more frequent I-70 Glenwood Canyon closings because of Grizzly Creek impacts.
""People need to understand we called it a limited reopening on Monday. There will be additional closures, "" Thatcher said. ""The likely closures in the near future will be due to a variety of factors. Rain and debris is certainly one of them. We want to make sure folks are prepared for that.""
Barron noted that the National Weather Service office in Grand Junction has been tapped to help with Glenwood Canyon road information. Because people need advance warning of potential driving hazards, the NWS will be more likely to issue Flash Flood Watch warnings in the burn scar area. The first example of the expanded warning happened Wednesday when rainstorms were forecast locally.
""The National Weather Service doesn't want to over-alert, but they do want to get info out there
early so people can make travel decisions,"" Barron said.
Thatcher agreed that checking the weather is a necessary precaution before embarking on a Glenwood Canyon trip.
""It is very different driving though the canyon right now,"" Thatcher said. ""We need people to check the weather before they drive. If there is rain in the forecast, they need to have an alternate route plan at their fingertips in case we have a closure.""
To learn more
Eagle County officials are drawing on their experiences from the 2018 Lake Christine Fire as they develop plans for the aftermath of the Grizzly Creek Fire .
""Areas near a burn scar are at risk of debris flows, mudslides and/or flash flooding,"" said Kris Widlak with Eagle County.
Debris flows are fast-moving, powerful mixtures of mud, rocks, boulders, and even entire trees. They are most common during intense rain after wildfires. When a wildfire burns a slope, it increases the chance of debris flows for several years.
Alerts about the threat of flash flooding, debris flows or mudslides in Glenwood Canyon or other areas, will be available at http://www.ECAlert.org, http://www.garco911.com, http://www.cotrip.org and https://agents.floodsmart.gov/flood-after-fire-in-your-community
Emergency planning
She noted that CDOT has developed a revised emergency closure plan and has personnel and equipment stationed in the canyon to respond. Beyond rainfall and potential debris issues, there are several other complicating factors for I-70 Glenwood Canyon travel right now. A large resurfacing project was underway when the fire ignited and crews are now back at work. That project is still slated for completion in October. ""It will feel a lot smoother and be a lot more durable than the previous material,"" Thatcher said.
As it evaluates road conditions, weather forecasts and construction traffic, Thatcher said CDOT is also studying how the fire impacted its existing rockfall mitigation structures.
With all these concerns related to I-70 Glenwood Canyon, Thatcher said CDOT has made a special safety appeal to motorists.
""We are really hoping the people will stay focused on the road while they are in the canyon,"" Thatcher said. ""Don't be trying to take photos or video while driving through.""
The I-70 Glenwood Canyon rest areas are closed and cars are not allowed to stop on road shoulders in the canyon. Slower speeds are being enforced and traffic is being directed to a single lane, head-to-head pattern in the construction area. Thatcher said CDOT understands that people are naturally curious about the fire scene, but stressed it is critical that motorists keep eyes on the
road.
""One crash, as everyone knows, can delay everything for everyone. If we can prevent that, it is a good day for everyone,"" Thatcher said.

What started as a small fire in the median of Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon has now grown into the largest fire in White River National Forest history.
The Grizzly Creek fire had burned an estimated 29,732 acres as of Thursday with 4% containment. Although the fire has slowed its spread, the Dotsero community remains alert with pre-evacuation orders that have been in place since August 13.
""The first day was very, very tough because people began to take things out of their homes. I saw people taking out T Vs, bikes, everything they had outside. There was a huge movement of people, lots of cars full of things,"" said Laura Rascn, a resident of the Dotsero mobile home park.
Rascn added that the fire has caused her children to panic, especially her youngest daughter.
""They are very nervous all the time. In fact, the youngest has been staying up late, always looking out the window to see what is happening,"" she said.
Packing up in a hurry
Cassandra Armas, a resident of the Two Rivers community in Dotsero for 14 years, said many people decided to leave their homes on August 13 despite having no official evacuation orders.
""That night I think many people left, we drove around to see and there were no cars in many of the houses. It looked like a ghost town,"" she said. ""I think Sunday morning was when people started coming back.""
Armas says the flames from the fire were visible from her home during the first two days when the fire crossed into Eagle County from Garfield County.
""Knowing that there is a fire very close to us causes a lot of fear, and it's very sad,"" she added.
Being prepared, staying informed
The Eagle County PIO's Facebook page said Wednesday that the Battle Mountain High School evacuation site would close because services had not been heavily used.
""Therefore, to preserve volunteer resources, it will be closed until needed,"" the PIO wrote on Facebook.
However, Stephanie Chavez, who also lives in Two Rivers with her family, decided to take her most important belongings to her grandmother's house in Gypsum, in case of evacuation.
""We took the essential things like papers, personal information, photos, some clothes and our
dog's belongings ... We took all of that to my grandmother's house,"" she said.
Chavez says her community has been staying informed on Facebook, where residents have been sharing important information about the fire.
""What has really helped the community is the Two Rivers Facebook page. A lot of people are posting updates on there and communicating with others,"" she said.
""And I think just having that community support and information makes you feel better,"" she added.
Rascn also said she felt supported by local organizations and agencies.
""They have given us a lot of support such as information on shelter, food, pets ... they have given us a lot of help at all times,"" she said.
Armas said, despite the uncertain times that the communities affected by the Grizzly Creek Fire are experiencing, it is important to remain calm.
""It is a situation that we cannot control and no matter how much we stress, we will not be able to change the situation. If we are not calm, we will not be able to respond well in case we are evacuated,"" she said. ""We hope that the fire is controlled and that it does not reach our valley.

""President Biden and his administration understand what our communities face and the immense magnitude of these challenges with hotter, drier and longer wildfireseasons in a climate-changed West,"" Polis said in a statement.
In addition to wildfire threats, a huge swath of the Pacific Northwest is in the midst in one of the worstheat waves in recent memory.
Biden announced plans Wednesday to temporarily raise pay for federal firefighters to ensure that no one fighting wildland fires is making less than $15 per hour as part of the response and prevention efforts. He has expressed dismay at the starting pay for federal firefighters, which is significantly lower than many local and state fire agencies.
Pay for new federal firefighters typically starts at $11 per hour to $14 per hour and they are overtime eligible, according to the Interior Department.
""That's going to end in my administration,"" Biden said during a visit last week to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a briefing on natural disaster prevention efforts. ""That's a ridiculously low salary to pay federal firefighters.""
Polis sat in on the call with Biden and other officials on Wednesday from the top of Pikes Peak at the new Pikes Peak Visitors Center. The White House's public transcript showed Polis did not speak, though in a news release, Polis' office said he shared Colorado's efforts for prevention and response to increasing wildfires. The state had its three largest wildfires in history last year.
The governor and Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control released the 2021 Wildfire Preparedness Plan in April. Earlier this month, he signed SB21-258 to allocate $25 million to wildfire risk mitigation, including partnering on some efforts with the U.S. Forest Service such as having the state's inmate workforce add mitigation work to their firefighting. Polis also has signed SB21113 to buy a new Firehawk helicopter and provide funding to the Colorado Firefighting Air Corps Fund and impacted communities.
Western states have been parched by severe drought and record heat that has burned more than 2,000 square miles (5,300 square kilometers) this year. That's ahead of the pace in 2020, which saw a near-record 15,000 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) burned as well as more than 17,000 homes and other structures destroyed.
The pay raise will come in the form of retention incentives and by providing additional bonuses to those working on the front lines. More experienced permanent firefighters could also be eligible for
a 10% retention incentive. Temporary firefighters will be eligible to receive some incentive pay under the plan.
The meeting comes as the White House released a memo confirming its commitment to a clean energy standard, tax credits and 500,000 charging stations for electric vehicles, among other climate goals as officials pursue a two-track approach on infrastructure.
A memo by climate adviser Gina McCarthy and White House senior adviser Anita Dunn also pledges at least $10 billion to conserve and restore public lands and waters, address environmental injustice and create a Civilian Climat e Corps (Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse is leading the push for it) to complete federally funded projects to respond to climate change and transition to a clean energy jobs.
The memo responds to criticism from environmental groups and other progressives who are frustrated that many climate-related initiatives were cut out of a bipartisan infrastructure plan announced last week.
""We know more work needs to be done, which is why President Biden will continue championing,"" the memo says, both the nearly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a separate, larger plan Biden and fellow Democrats aim to approve along party lines.
On wildfires, administration officials have pledged to work with Congress to increase firefighter pay and convert at least 1,000 seasonal wildland firefighters to year-round workers as fires have grown more severe.
The U.S. Forest Service and Interior Department combine to employ about 15,000 firefighters. Roughly 70% are full time and 30% are seasonal. Those figures used to be reversed, but have changed as fire seasons have grown longer and more severe.
The White House is expected to use the governors' meeting to detail plans to extend seasonal hiring of firefighters, hire additional firefighters and add surge capacity by training and equipping more federal employees and military personnel to support wildland fire fighting efforts.
U.S. Forest Service Deputy Chief Christopher French testified last week before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that firefighters need more pay in recognition of the growing workload.

At Loveland event Gov Polis calls on all voices to join sust.txt,"For Gov. Jared Polis, climate action is not a zero-sum game. Without aggressive measures from municipal to federal governments, everyone loses, he said.
""We need everyone's ideas. We need everybody's voice,"" Polis said. ""Together we can protect our way of life and support our academic growth, so that we can be the one that markets many of these climate solutions across our country and across the world, have a better environmenthere at home and a better economy for ourselves and the future.""
Polis spoke at BizWest's Net Zero Cities conference on Thursday at The Ranch in Loveland. He said tackling climate change goes beyond Colorado's borders.
""There's a lot of work we need to do more sustainably, whether it's recycling and reuse, whether it's climate or water, whether it is the local governments, the state, the federal government or the world,"" Polis said. ""We all need to step up and be leaders.""
The campaign that put him in the Colorado governor's office in 2018 ran partly on his road map to make Colorado 100 percent powered by renewable energy by 2040.
The governor's road map involves changing the Public Utilities Commission by appointing pro-consumer and pro-renewable-energy members, moving toward zero-emission buildings and creating green jobs.
In January 2019, Polis' first executive order supported a transition toward electric vehicles. The order required the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to establish a Colorado Zero Emission Vehicle Program under the Clean Air Act.
The adoption of electric vehicles will result in quieter streets, better air quality and reduced carbon output, Polis said. The $68.7 million the state will receive in the Volkswagen emissions scandal settlement will be invested into energy-efficient transit, such as a statewide electric-car-charging infrastructure to encourage consumers to make the switch.
The state last year created the Renewable/Clean Energy Challenge grant program that incentivizes the goal of 100 percent renewable by 2040.
Municipalities, counties, school districts, special districts and other political subdivisions are eligible to receive grants for implementation projects. Funded projects should be large in scale, serve those with the greatest need and sustain long-term progress, among other things.
Polis said there are 14 cities in the state that have more ambitious climate action plans than his. Rather than planning to achieve 100 percent renewable energy by 2040, these cities want to meet the mark between 2030 and 2035.
The communities include Boulder and Fort Collins. Aspen and Glenwood Springs already are fully powered by renewable energy.
""Typically we think about the local government's role as filling potholes, locking up bad guys, you know, putting out fires,"" said Jonathan Koehn, environmental affairs manager for the city of Boulder. He said Boulder's government recognizes that it has to work climate action plans into its portfolio.
The city plans to double the amount of bus services available in the next 20 years, build electric-carcharging stations and make bikes available to the public. City building codes are being reworked to force or encourage all new Boulder buildings to be net-zero compliant by 2030, meaning they will produce at least as much energy as they consume.
Fort Collins also has a climate plan in action. In 2015, the Fort Collins City Council voted to implement a climate action plan that aims to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050, said Mayor Wade Troxell. He added that most recently, the city agreed to have 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030 in partnership with Platte River Power Authority, the wholesale electric supplier for Fort Collins, Loveland, Estes Park and Longmont. Polis said there are approximately 63,000 residents in the state employed in renewable energy, a 9 percent increase over the year before.
He noted that while there's momentum in the utility sector, other industries will need to follow suit if the state is to meet Polis' road map.
Darla Arians, chairwoman of the Advisory Committee on Environmental Sustainability for the city of Broomfield, said that community's zero-waste plan aims to have the city 50 percent waste-free by 2025 and achieve zero-waste status by 2035.
Broomfield currently has 43 electrical accounts that subscribe to Xcel Energy's renewable connect program that provides renewable energy credits directly to Broomfield.
Lori Hodges, director of the Office of Emergency Management for Larimer County, said six departments are collecting action recommendations that will be presented to the county commissioners in April. Larimer County plans to create a new compost facility at its landfill. She said 30 percent of the current landfill waste can be reused.
Boulder County Commissioner Deb Gardner said that Clean Energy Action, EnergySmart and Partners for a Clean Environment have been key to helping individuals and businesses in Boulder County adopt clean energy. She said 19,000 homes and 3,100 businesses have worked with these three programs.

At_least_26_homes_lost_as_Cal-Wood_fire_still_at_8__Colorado_Daily_Boulder_CO___October_18_2020.txt,"At least 26 homes have been destroyed and parts of northwest Boulder County remain evacuated, but firefighters were able to limit growth on the Cal-Wood Fire on Sunday.
Boulder County sheriff's Division Chief Mike Wagner said there was ""relatively little growth"" on the fire Sunday, and at 7 p.m. Sunday it remained at 8,788 acres and 15% containment. He said the most concerning area of the fire heading into Monday is the difficult, steep and rocky northern ridge terrain.
At almost 9,000 acres, Cal-Wood is already the largest wildfire in the county's history, surpassing 2010's Fourmile Fire, officials said. The Fourmile Fire burned a total of 6,181 acres and destroyed 165 homes plus four other structures in the mountains west of Boulder.
Sunday evening, Boulder Reservoir was closed to the public so it can serve as an operations center and campsite for firefighters fighting the Cal-Wood and Lefthand Canyon fires, Boulder officials announced. City Manager Jane Brautigam declared a local disaster emergency and issued an emergency order closing the reservoir, according to a tweet on the city's official account.
Wagner said after an initial damage assessment, at least 26 homes have been lost in the fire , though he said there were likely more that investigators have not been able to find yet.
Of those homes, 19 were on Mountain Ridge Road on the eastern edge of the fire near U.S. 36 and Nelson Road, four were on Foothills Ranch Drive and three are listed in the Heil Ranch neighborhood. Of the 26 structures, 23 are deemed a total loss. The full list of structure damage can be found at www.boulderoem.com.
Wagner did say fire crews were able to prevent the loss of any more structures Sunday through fire suppression efforts.
He added that at this time only two people at this time are unaccounted for, and that their home was on the edge of the evacuation zone and not in the burn area, but family had not been able to reach them since about 2:30 p.m. Sunday.
Two other people reported missing Saturday night that have since been found. A firefighter with a minor ankle injury Saturday is the extent of known injuries at this time.
Wagner also said the initial plan for Sunday was for aerial crews to hit the fire ""as hard as they can"" before winds picked back up later in the day, but weather ultimately did not allow aerial crews to attack the Cal-Wood Fire , though they were able to work on the nearby Lefthand Canyon Fire .
About 250 firefighters are continuing to work the fire on the ground, with teams going into the field to assess damage when it's safe, Wagner said. Additionally, there are about 65 people working in Boulder's emergency operations center and about 80 law enforcement officers are
securing the perimeter and patrolling within the closure.
By 5:30 p.m. Sunday, Boulder County officials reported containment on the fire had gone from 5% in the morning to 15%.
A federal incident team will be taking over command of the fire Monday morning, Wagner said.
Saturday, the evacuation area included Jamestown plus areas north of Jamestown east through Altona. However, evacuation orders for all areas east of North Foothills Highway were lifted at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. Jamestown remains in the evacuation warning area.
In total, Boulder County officials said 1,646 residences were within the mandatory evacuation area on Saturday, with a population of 2,984 people.
A complete evacuation map can be found at bouldercounty.maps.arcg is.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html? id=13ab214fe2bb4da5a850df0ca0f00fc5.
An evacuation point has been set up at Boulder County's North Broadway Complex at 3460 N. Broadway where evacuees can find information.
The fire was first reported at noon Saturday near the Cal-Wood Education Center at 2282 County Road 87.
As of Sunday evening, a cause and point of origin have not yet been determined. Wagner did say Saturday night that there were no lightning strikes in the area, so the fire was likely not weatherrelated. The Boulder County Sheriff's Office and the U.S. Forest Service are jointly investigating the fire.
U.S. 36 remained closed between Boulder and Lyons overnight Saturday. Lee Hill Road is closed at Lefthand Canyon, as is Olde Stage Road.
Heil Valley Ranch and Hall Ranch trails are closed. Lagerman Agricultural Preserve, Pella Crossing and Anne U. White Trail on Boulder County open space also were closed as the fire advanced, while Longmont closed Button Rock Preserve.
""We know curiosity is a big thing. We just ask the community to be helpful, allow fire personal distance to work and to get their job done so they can suppress the fire as quickly as possible,""
Wagner said at the news conference.
Officials advised people to avoid the area to allow first responders room to work.
U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Lafayette, announced on Saturday that FEMA has authorized federal funds to help fight the fire through a Fire Management Assistance Grant.
Boulder Valley School District announced Sunday evening shortly after 7:30 p.m. Gold Hill and Jamestown elementary schools will be closed Monday as a result of the fires. The closure will impact mostly staff, since Monday is an independent remote learning day, a tweet from the school district reads.
Officials in both districts offered support to affected families. So far, no school buildings in either district have been affected.

Avoiding_disaster_How_to_mitigate_the_risk_of__Summit_Daily_News_CO___July_1_2021.txt,"Countless guests visit Summit County every year to explore the mountains, have adventures in the backcountry and escape the bustle of city life in favor of camping under the stars.
But as heat from the summer sun beats down on the forests throughout the county, guests also need to be aware of and help to mitigate the risks of the biggest natural threat facing mountain communities: wildfire.
""The reason that we are here, and the reason our visitors come here, is because of our lovely mountains and natural places, including our forests,"" Summit Fire & EMS spokesperson Steve Lipsher said. ""We've seen far too many communities throughout the West that have been devastated by wildfire, and we want to preserve every reason why we're all here in the first place. The way we do that is by minimizing our most prominent existential threat, and that is wildfire.
""So we ask everybody, locals and visitors alike, to be wildfire aware and to understand that our forests here in the arid West are prone to wildfire. We don't need to have lapses in care occur. Even a momentary oversight can result in a catastrophic wildfire.""
The 2020 wildfireseason was among the most destructive ever in the state, with the three largest wildfires in Colorado history all taking place last year. Luckily, there are some easy steps that Summit County visitors and residents can take to help keep the danger at bay.
First and foremost, backcountry users should practice safe campfire techniques. Under the current Stage 2 fire restrictions, campfires are not allowed, but when campfires are permitted, campers should always make sure that they are building their fire in a safe space without any nearby vegetation and that the flames stay at a manageable size. Campers should never leave a fire unattended and should always ensure that it's completely out before taking off.
""We really want to drive home how important that is and how frequently campfires break out of their little fire rings, go further and potentially start bigger fires ,"" Lipsher said. ""When you're done with your campfire, extinguish it fully. The practice there is to douse it with water, stir the ashes, and douse them again until they are literally cool to the touch. When you stick your hand in the pile of ashes, you should not feel any heat whatsoever.""
Guests can get a sense of the current conditions through fire danger signs and variable message boards scattered throughout the community or by checking out the Summit Daily News, which publishes the fire danger daily on Page 2. Fire restrictions are frequently put in place during the summer and fall, and information on what is or isn't allowed is easily accessible on the websites for Summit County government, Summit Fire & EMS, and the Red, White & Blue Fire Protection District.
While it's impossible for even experts to accurately forecast what the wildfireseason will bring, officials say they're preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. But it is incumbent on every
resident and visitor to do their part to make sure lives, property and the beautiful environment aren't endangered unnecessarily by a human-caused wildfire.
""A fire can start anywhere at any time, and depending on the conditions of the day -- if it gets up in the 70s or 80s and we have wind -- we could have disastrous results,"" Red, White & Blue Chief Jim Keating said. ""We're living in a world right now assuming this is going to be a really bad season. That comes from the memory of what happened last year.
""We're asking people to take every caution they can. We'd really like to be able to have a really safe summer.""

September 7, 2020  Colorado Sun, The (CO)  Jesse Paul
The Cameron Peak fire west of Fort Collins continued its rapid expansion on Monday, with authorities warning that the blaze -- which is now one of the largest recorded in Colorado -- is threatening structures.
""There is definitely a lot of structures under threat,"" Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said, speaking to reporters at a news conference Monday afternoon, ash from the fire falling around him. ""Some imminent threat, some immediate threat and some further out.""
To-date, however, there have been no reports of destroyed buildings. Officials warned they haven't been able to assess some areas where the fire passed through, though.
A number of new evacuation orders were issued on Sunday, including for the Glacier View subdivision. In fact, as officials were speaking at the news conference new evacuation orders were issued.
The fire had burned more than 102,000 acres as of Tuesday morning, making it the fifth largest recorded in Colorado and several thousand acres larger than the High Park fire that destroyed at least 259 homes in Larimer County and killed one person in 2012. The Cameron Peak fire made a 10-mile run on Saturday and Sunday, roughly doubling in size. The eastern perimeter of the fire was the most active, incident commanders said, as flames spread in the crowns of trees toward Buckhorn Canyon and the High Park burn scar.
Fire crews are hoping for some relief Monday night when a blast of cold weather moves in. Smith said the weather system won't put out the fire, but it will allow firefighters to take a break.
""It's certainly not going to stop this fire,"" Smith said, speaking of forecast snow.
The fire ignited on Aug. 13 near Chambers Lake. Officials believe it is human-caused and have asked for tips as they investigate how it began.
The fire has also entered a remote, northern area of Rocky Mountain National Park, prompting the closure of Trail Ridge and Old Fall River roads.
""This fire is full of more surprises than we've ever seen,"" Smith said.
Smoke from the fire has choked the Front Range since Sunday.
Colorado's state health department issued an air quality alert for much of the Front Range including Denver, Boulder, Longmont, Fort Collins and Greeley. Officials said the dense smoke from
the fires could be unhealthy for older adults, children and people with lung disease or respiratory illnesses.
Those populations were advised to stay indoors if smoke becomes thick in their neighborhoods.
Closures of U.S. Forest Service land were extended to include areas east of the fire nearly to Fort Collins.
Health officials issued a separate smoke advisory for areas of northwestern Colorado due to fires burning in neighboring Utah.------------
All of Colorado is listed under some kind of drought status. The temperature in Denver reached or surpassed 90 degrees on Monday for the 73rd time this year, tying a record set in 2012.
Climate change has been blamed for the extraordinary heat this summer in Colorado.
The ""Old Farmer's Almanac"" is predicting above-normal winter precipitation in the northern portions of Utah and Colorado, the eastern sections of Washington and Oregon and the western Dakotas.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Firefighters in Glenwood Canyon said Thursday the weather in recent days has added to the complexity of taming a wildfire that has burned more than 29,000 acres.
""The weather has been moody, to say the least,"" said Joe Kempel, an engine operator with a firefighting outfight from Cascade, Montana, that is under contract to the federal government.
Kempel and his crew have an engine that holds more than 1,100 gallons of water. They were helping protect cabins and other structures at the historic Bair Ranch on the eastern end of the canyon. They were stationed about 1 mile south of Interstate 70 and a few hundred feet above it.
T hunderstorms on Wednesday afternoon and evening brought in erratic, downdraft winds that kept firefighters answering the threat of flames moving from different directions on the steep slopes packed with pinion, juniper and oak brush so thick it's difficult to walk through.
""It was a wild day for us trying to make a stand and save the cabins,"" Kempel said.
Thursday brought more of the same with a storm bringing lightning, thunder and a rain shower between 12:30 and 1 p.m.
Despite the challenges, the firefighters have saved the nine structures clustered on one section of Bair Ranch and more structures elsewhere.
On Thursday, agricultural sprinklers wetted down the yard around cabins, hoses from engines such as Kempel's were in place for emergency use and additional water was stored in mobile tanks called pumpkins.
A key to saving structures on Bair Ranch was emergency work by a bulldozer Sunday evening clearing a firebreak between the toe of a steep slope and the flat ground around the cabins, according to Wayne Patterson, a public information officer for the Incident Command Team.
""That was a pretty intense firefight,"" he said.
The fire burned right to the firebreak in spots. Crews doused hotspots when embers jumped the line, Kempel said.
PROGRESS EXPECT ED IN COMING DAYS
Despite the challenges posed by cliff bands, inaccessible terrain and erratic winds, the 849 personnel on the Grizzly Creek Fire are gaining the upper hand, Patterson said.
Containment was listed at only 4% on Thursday, but that doesn't reflect the progress being made with securing fire lines produced by heavy machinery and hand crews.
""We're going to see the containment jumping in the next four or five days,"" Patterson said.
The process is like building a box around the perimeter and keeping the fire contained inside, he said.
North of Interstate 70 toward Coffee Pot Road in the Flattops the fire crews were able to erect a side of the box ""that will help us contain this fire when it comes racing up out of these drainages,"" Patterson said.
In places, existing U.S. Forest Service routes and ranch roads are being used to create the box. In other places, bulldozers scrape the earth raw to inhibit the spread of flames. Crews are undertaking that work both north and south of I-70 and the Colorado River.
""We're trying to connect the dots all around the fire,"" Patterson said. ""There are two areas that aren't quite connected.""
One is on the northeast edge of Glenwood Springs; the other is on the northeastern side of Lookout Mountain.
In the considerable amount of terrain that is inaccessible for heavy machinery, hotshot crews hoofed it in the create lines, such as in No Name Creek, where it was critical to prevent the fire from climbing the western ridge and marching toward Glenwood Springs.
""When I first came here, the team was thinking there was no way they were going to hold it there,"" Patterson said. ""They didn't think they'd be able to prevent the fire from hooking around and coming in back door to Glenwood Springs.""
Another hotshot crew went up the drainage across the interstate from Bair Ranch and physically created a containment line thathelped impede the fire's march toward Dotsero.
Patterson pointed out that while the winds have been erratic and kept crews on their toes at times, the winds also have been beneficial at other times and blown the fire back on itself.
""(The crews) come right up against the black and put in fire line,"" he said.
The effort to secure the fire line around Lookout Mountain will require altering a popular hiking and mountain biking route called the Boy Scout Trail.
""We have gotten a line over to Lookout Mountain, now we're working on completing that line and having those dozers working from there down to Lookout Park,"" Patterson said. ""Then the next step is, there is a trail that the community has that is used really heavily all the way down to 8th Street in Glenwood Springs. They refer to that as the Boy Scout Trail. They're in there today starting to open that up just a little bit. They're trying to be light-handed because it's such a popular spot for hiking and that sort of thing.""
A bowl to the east of Lookout Mountain is full of oak brush and remains ""a major concern on this
fire,"" Patterson said.
PART S OF CANYON 'APOCALYPT IC'
In a media tour led by Patterson on Thursday, the only signs of active fire along I-70 were small plumes of smoke from an occasional hotspot.
The fire thoroughly charred a roughly 3-mile stretch west and east of Grizzly Creek on the north side of the interstate. Further to the east, there is a mosaic of burned and untouched vegetation among the soaring rock cliffs on both sides of the river. Vast stretches along the 18-mile corridor were untouched by the fire.
At Hanging Lake parking lot and trailhead, the fire burned down to the valley floor in places. The fire left a checkerboard pattern in the vegetation scattered throughout the rock walls. One spot is completely burned out; a few feet away the heat scorched the leaves of the brush and conifer trees; another few feet away the vegetation looks normal.
""The canyon will be different but it will still be an icon for people in Glenwood Springs and for visitors,"" said Scott Fitzwilliams, White River National Forest supervisor.
The fire ran up the drainages but skipped a lot of the terrain in the valley floor, he noted.
""The more severe fire is on top of there,"" Fitzwilliams said.
Patterson said it is a relief that such beautiful terrain survived as well as it did.
""I think anybody coming from the Glenwood Springs side, as soon as they come around the corner and see that first face that's just burned so intensely, I think their hearts are going to drop,"" Patterson said. ""But as they get further in, you start seeing that mosaic pattern.""
In a virtual news conference Thursday evening, Michael Goolsby, northwest region transportation director for the Colorado Department of Transportation, said the destruction will be rough on some observers.
""If you're traveling on the eastbound portion of the interstate right now, which we have had to have traffic running because of the construction project, you're not gonna think that it really is that impactful other than if you look up on the slopes,"" he said. ""If you're up on the westbound portion of it, it's apocalyptic. There's areas up there that it's destroyed. It's terrible and it pains me to see it.""
He later added, ""I can tell you that it definitely brings an emotional response when they see it. I had somebody specifically tell me they went through it and cried when they saw it, so there's some areas up there that are pretty bad.""

Basalt_beefs_up_fire-wise_regulations_as_part_of__Aspen_Times_The_CO___August_26_2020.txt,"Basalt be e fs up 'fire -wise ' re gulatio ns as p art o f - Asp e n T ime s, The (CO ) - August 26, 2020
The town of Basalt wants the legacy of the Lake Christine Fire to be positive.
Town Council on Tuesday night approved a second and final reading of an ordinance that beefs up the building code for new residences to provide protection from wildfires.
Town Manager Ryan Mahoney said the town is adopting several ""common sense"" concepts.
""You don't want to have a wooden fence against a structure, for example,"" he said.
A recent fire in Colorado Springs showed how fire can spread to homes after ember storms set fire to fences. The new building code provision will require a 36-inch break between the wooden fence and home. The gap can be filled with a metal section or materials that aren't flammable.
An ""informal committee"" of fire department officials, town staffers and attorneys proposed modifications to five chapters of the town building code. The goal, Mahoney said, was to make new residential construction more ""fire -wise"" or ""hardened.""
The modifications address everything from materials used for decks and exterior walls to covers for gutters.
In a community meeting early this month on the proposed changes, fire marshal John Mele said ongoing drought and devastation from wildfires is forcing more cities, towns and counties in Colorado to modify building codes, including those in the Roaring Fork Valley.
""It's not just a foresthealth problem. It's a structure problem too,"" Mele said.
The various modifications that were proposed were designed to prevent embers from a wildfire from infiltrating a home.
""You have to think like an ember here,"" Mele said.
The beefed-up building code can result in more costly construction, but savings in the long haul for homeowners. The rules will not be applied to existing structures.
""It's a code that's built for the future. It's not retroactive,"" Mele said.
The council approved the ordinance 7-0. The new rules will be in effect Sept. 17.

The Roaring Fork Valley experienced a spread of Douglas fir, spruce and western balsam bark beetles last year but the infestations remained light compared to many other parts of the state, according to the latest assessment.
The U.S. Forest Service and Colorado State Forest Service released results of their 2020 Forest Insect and Disease aerial survey last month. The annual flyover of the state's forests was pared down last year because of COVID-19 challenges. It covered 16 million acres or about half of prior years. The Roaring Fork Valley was one of the priority areas.
""I can share (that the) spruce beetle has moved into the Aspen area, particularly in the northern reaches of the Elk Mountains,"" Dan West, forest entomologist with the state forest service, wrote in an email.
The aerial survey indicated the White River National Forest had about 160 acres of new spruce beetle activity that was detectable from the air. The infestation is likely more widespread, he said, because what can be seen from the air is usually less than what's on the ground.
The survey also determined that the Douglas-fir beetle infestation has intensified because of the Lake Christine fire of July 2018 on Basalt Mountain.
""Moderately scorched trees are havens for bark beetles, and the trees along the burn perimeter were likely brood trees for these beetles,"" West said.
Foresthealth assessments are vital because Colorado's forests have come under pressure from climate change. Warmer temperatures and unpredictable precipitation levels are stressing trees, said Adam McCurdy, forest and climate director at Aspen Center for Environmental Studies.
He said Douglas-fir beetles have been a slow but growing problem primarily downvalley from Aspen.
""To me, that's a big and continuing part of the foresthealth story,"" McCurdy said. ""I don't think it's gotten enough attention in the valley.""
The Douglas-fir beetle problem has been a ""slow burn"" compared to the mountain pine bark beetle infestation that was so visible in many parts of the state, he said. Large swaths of lodgepole pine trees in the Interstate 70 corridor died and turned rust color during the pine beetle infestation of the late-1990s and early-2000s. The Roaring Fork Valley was largely spared from the mountain pine beetle infestation because of its diversity in tree types and age classes.
The aerial survey report includes a map that shows areas of infestation from various beetles. The terrain surrounding the Roaring Fork Valley has what looks like small freckles representing the outbreaks. Other parts of the state are covered with larger blotches representing more
widespread infestations.
McCurdy said Douglas fir trees have proven in the past to be resilient because they are hardier in a warmer climate . Recent droughts and warm temperatures have stressed them.
West agreed that drought throughout Colorado has made Douglas firs more vulnerable to beetles. Last year's weather pattern added to the problem.
""Plenty of snow during the winter, then dried all up and severe to extreme drought conditions cause trees to become vulnerable,"" West said. ""I don't think 2021 will be any different, since the drought continues through much of the central and southern mountains.""
McCurdy pointed out that intense Douglas-fir beetle infestations are on the doorstep of Pitkin County, in eastern Gunnison County.
In addition to Douglas-fir infestations, the aerial survey map shows small outbreaks of western balsam bark beetles in higher elevations of the Independence Pass corridor as well as Castle and Maroon creek valleys. Sub-alpine fir trees are vulnerable to the western balsam bark beetles. There are also a few small pockets of spruce beetle infestations in the Roaring Fork watershed.
The Colorado State Forest Service also identified disease in Colorado's signature aspen trees as another emerging problem in 2020, largely because of drought.
McCurdy said there is ample evidence of aspen stands experiencing problems in the Aspen area.
The White River National Forest recently announced a major proposal for a decades-long aspen management plan. The 2.3 million-acre forest contains an estimated 600,000 acres of aspen trees. About 375,000 acres are targeted for timber harvesting and prescribed fire to maintain and expand aspen stands.

Before_a_prescribed_burn_comes_a_ton_of_planning__Durango_Herald_The_CO___June_9_2021.txt,"Be fo re a p re scribe d burn co me s a to n o f p lanning - Durango He rald, The (CO ) - June 9, 2021

PAGOSA SPRINGS  ""I had no idea they did all this planning.""
It's a comment Fred Ellis, assistant fire management officer with the Pagosa Ranger District in the San Juan National Forest , hears consistently after community presentations for people living near a prescribed burn.
Before the first crews are in the field to light a prescribed burn, up to three years of planning may have gone into the effort to maximize the safety of the operation, the effectiveness in improving foresthealth and the effectiveness of lowering the risk of a catastrophic wildfire.
In fact, before any prescribed burn even reaches initial planning stages, the general practice of using prescription burning to cut down on forest understory must be approved of in broader earlier studies required for each individual national forest .
The first is a land/resource management plan. This overarching document must permit the use of prescribed burns as appropriate for the ecology in each individual national forest .
Secondly, prescribed burns follow a broader fire management plan in place for each national forest , and burns must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act. Any individual burn may require an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment.
Those requirements mean a lot of work is done in the San Juan National Forest a year or more before the typical prescribed burning season  April and early May and again in September.
In the typical year, about 10,000 acres in the San Juan National Forest are treated by prescribed fire, which can include everything from burning slash piles to a 1,000-acre prescribed burn.
Brad Pietruszka, fuels program manager for the San Juan National Forest , said multiple options are open for the number of prescribed burns that might go off in any burning season.
If this year's monsoons are ""perfect,"" as many as 15,000 acres might undergo treatment from a prescribed burn in the fall burning season. If monsoons fail, like last year, no fall burns may be conducted.
""It's just too dry,"" he said.
Another factor in the number of prescribed burns that can go off is the available personnel, Pietruszka said.
""We need a lot of other places in the West to not have incredibly active fire seasons because the same resources we use to do prescribed fires are the same ones that go to fight a fire,"" he said.
It might take up to three years before actual conditions on the ground are at a point where it is safe to implement a planned burn, Pietruszka said.
Ellis said: ""I hesitate to say this, but the actual implementation is kind of the easy part. So if you've done all your planning correctly, if you're monitoring the environmental conditions on the ground, and you have the right resources, you can go out there and pull off the burn without a hitch.""
The Pagosa Ranger District follows a programmatic environmental assessment that covers 256,000 acres of ponderosa pine forest .
Another preliminary study before an individual burn plan is written is a complexity analysis, which examines any elements that might be tricky, whether it would be logistics, terrain features, proximity of structures or other unique features that might impact safety and the way the burn should be handled.
A complexity analysis determines if the planned burn will be low, moderate or high in complexity.
Only after all this preliminary work is done does actual work begin on an individual burn plan.
Each burn plan must be analyzed for its impact on cultural resources, wildlife and the hydrology  stream flows or ponds, lakes and washes.
""A burn plan has 21 elements in it,"" Ellis said.
Among a burn plan's elements are detailed studies of the personnel and equipment required, a communication plan, an ignition plan, a holding plan, a contingency plan, a smoke-management and air-quality plan, a monitoring plan and a plan for post-burn activities.
Perhaps the most important element of a burn plan is a public and personnel safety and medical plan.
It is this portion of the burn plan that specifies efforts required to mitigate safety hazards. It must contain plans for emergency medical procedures, emergency evacuation methods and identification of local, county and state agencies, and contacts and liaisons that will be required for a safe burn.
The burn plan also requires a test burn be ignited in a representative area and the results must be documented to verify the prescribed fire behavior characteristics and smoke dispersion meets objectives.
After a ""burn boss"" completes a burn plan, it is then reviewed by another burn boss, usually someone in a different national forest .
""We don't want somebody here in our own office reviewing a plan I wrote,"" Ellis said. ""We want fresh eyes, and if they've identified issues, we can make changes.""
After the burn plan has been critiqued, it then is also reviewed by either the district ranger or the
forest supervisor.
Only after these reviews will a burn plan be ready for the field.
The 400-acre Brockover Prescribed Fire, completed on May 1, is the latest of a dozen or so prescribed burns conducted since 2000 in the T urkey Springs area, west of Pagosa Lakes.
""We targeted this particular area, specifically because it is west of the highest concentration of homes in Archuleta County,"" Ellis said. ""With our predominant southwest winds, if we were to have a major fire and there were no treatments, it could potentially impact the homes up in Pagosa Lakes.""
Pietruszka said the role of fire in the ponderosa pine forest ecosystem, which stretches from northern Mexico to Montana, has been heavily studied.
""Before white settlement of the area, the San Juan burned anywhere from six to 25 years, and contrary to things you might read, outside of Flagstaff, or northern Arizona, the fires that moved through here were a mix of intensity,"" he said.
Fires ranged from low intensity burns with short flame lengths that ""didn't kill much"" to more intense fires that reduced the canopy structure, he said.
""You ended up with a big mix of successional classes of trees, trees at different stages,"" Pietruszka said. ""You'd have individual stands of old trees real spread out, and then you'd also have a lot of little seedlings coming up where the fire was more intense and fire maybe killed the overstory.""
That natural landscape limited how big fires could grow, he said.
""Odds were pretty good that a new fire, at some point, say in a drought year, was going to run into an old fire from the year before or two years before,"" he said. ""So you'd get this big patchwork in the landscape of the pine belt.""
When fire suppression began in the 1930s, an unintended consequence was the buildup of hazardous fuels and the growth of trees that lacked a diversity of sizes in the ponderosa forests.
The goal of prescribed fires is to mimic that natural pattern of mostly smaller fires , keeping fuel levels down and reducing the chance of a large catastrophic burn.
""It's with prescribed fire we try get fire back in these areas that have missed anywhere between six and 20 fire cycles, depending on the site,"" he said. ""That's a lot of eggs in one basket to try to undo  missing maybe 20 disturbance events  to make up for that in one.""
Pietruszka said the effort to re-create the natural cycle of fires is why the Forest Service likes to return to a previously burned area every six to 15 years.
Ellis noted the Brockover Prescribed Fire was the second conducted in the area in the past 10 years, which is ideal.
""It's not one and done. We want to do burns on a rotational basis. Ithelps to throw back the fuels,"" Ellis said.
The first thing Ellis does in planning a prescribed burn is to ""spend a fair amount of time walking around the woods.""
""I'm in prospective units, looking for control features,"" he said. ""If we don't have to construct features, put in lines, so much the better.""
The Brockover Prescribed Fire used T urkey Springs Road as a fire break on the west, a bicycle trail on the east and a fenceline on the north.
In the end, only the southern perimeter required crews to cut a handline.
""In a prescribed burn, we don't want to burn everything. What we want is a mosaic,"" Ellis said.
Walking through the Brockover burn area a month after the prescribed fire, Ellis pointed out large scorched ponderosas.
Ponderosas, he said, are adapted to fire.
""A ponderosa with 75%, 80% of its needles burned will survive,"" he said. ""This Gambel oak looks like it's dead. It's not; you can't kill Gambel oak.""
Areas treated by prescribed burns are far better prepared than untreated areas should a lightning strike or a carelessly discarded cigarette start a wildfire.
""It's a lot easier to deal with a fire with 3-foot high Gambel oak than 12-foot high,"" he said.

April 15, 2021  Burling ton Record (CO)  Rick Mauch
Not long ago, T ravis Belden was running a 40,000-acre ranch near Fort Collins. Beginning May 1, he will be herding up bad guys as the new sheriff of Kit Carson County.
KCC Commissioners appointed Belden to fill the position that will be vacated when Tom Ridnour, who served as sheriff for many years, retires.
Belden was a deputy and undersheriff for Ridnour from 2012-2020 before leaving the department in August to run the aforementioned ranch.
""I'm excited about it,"" Belden commented on the appointment. ""A lot of staff and people in the community wanted me to come back. It was hard for me to say no to that.""
As for working on the ranch, he added, ""I was kind of needing to get out of here and do something else for a bit.""
While at the ranch, Belden said he dealt with the notorious Cameron Peak Fire that was one of the largest in state history.
""Our main ranch was about 15 miles away, and it burned through several of our forest leases,"" he stated.
Belden recalled rescuing several head of cattle even as the fire was on top of them. ""We were actually inside the fire,"" he recollected.
And now thathe's back, so is Wick (named after the character in the movie ""John Wick""), the former K-9 member of the department, Belden acknowledged.
It was Belden who underwent extensive training to work with Wick, so when he left the force, with no one left with the proper training, Wick went to live with Belden.
""I'm going to put him right back to work,"" Belden noted. ""That's a $15,000 dog sitting at home.""
And yes, Belden addressed the issue of the November 2022 election, in which he'll have to run and win if he wants to remain KCC sheriff beyond that.
""Absolutely,"" he exclaimed. ""I'm back here, and I want to stay sheriff as long as this community will have me.""

Big_questions_loom_after_inspection_of_Grizzly__Sky-Hi_News_Granby_CO___March_2_2021.txt,"Big q ue stio ns lo o m afte r insp e ctio n o f Grizzly - Sky-Hi Ne ws (Granby, CO ) - March 2, 2021
March 2, 2021  Sky-Hi News (Granby, CO)  Scott Condon; Aspen Times
The Grizzly Creek Fire covered 32,631 acres before it was officially deemed contained Dec. 18. It shut down Interstate 70 for two weeks after it ignited on Aug. 10. It threatened Glenwood Springs' water supply and forced the closure of popular hiking trails and rafting put-ins.
The disruption likely isn't finished.
""We're going to learn a lot this summer,"" said Steve Hunter, a former engineer with the White River National Forest and member of the Burn Area Emergency Response team, or BAER. That group of scientists and specialists started assessing the Grizzly Creek burn area for soil burn severity and potential problems areas for flooding and debris flows even before the fire was out.
Hunter discussed the role of the BAER team and the major issues facing the Grizzly Creek Fire burn scar during a videoconference Thursday night hosted by Roaring Fork Conservancy, a Basalt nonprofit that explores all issues related to water in the Roaring Fork Valley.
The BAER team's work helped determined that 12% of the terrain within the perimeter of the fire suffered a high level of burn severity. That means all or nearly all of the pre-fire ground cover and surface organic matter was consumed. The soil became hardened and will shed water instead of absorb it.
Another 43% of the terrain suffered moderate burn severity while 33% of terrain sustained low severity and 12% was unburned.
Firefighters did a remarkable job protecting two of the major drainages from the fire. No Name Creek, which drains down into a residential area, was only 8% burned. Grizzly Creek was 14% burned. Terrain in other catchments was up to 40% burned.
The areas that suffered the most fire damage may be most susceptible to flooding, debris flows and rock falls. The Glenwood Canyon walls are steep, Hunter said.
Many of the roots and vegetation that anchored rocks and dirt have disappeared. So a canyon that was susceptible to rock falls events even before the fire is even riper now.
""This canyon is very susceptible to rock fall,"" Hunter said.
Several steps have already been taken to try to gauge the risks and provide tools to warn about threats to Interstate 70, utilities in the Colorado River corridor and homes in populated parts of the canyon.
Numerous rain gauges were installed high up the canyon walls to help foresee flash flooding potential. The U.S. Geological Survey has run hydrologic modeling and runoff for major drainages within the burn area. (The website wasn't operating properly Friday.) The U.S. Service assessed
areas where culverts need to be cleared, repaired and even enlarged to handle expected debris flows.
""Post-fire BAER implementation started late last fall and will continue this summer,"" said Elizabeth Roberts, ecologist and BAER team coordinator for the White River National Forest . ""We are doing emergency repairs on all recreation trails and roads within the canyon.""
At this point, the Forest Service does not plan to reseed significant acreage within the burn area. One hurdle is the terrain itself. Sending hand crews up the steep slopes is not practical or safe and it would be difficult to seed by airplane.
""We have to have access and access in that canyon is challenging,"" Roberts said.
Where access isn't as big of a challenge, the Forest Service will monitor conditions to determine if terrain can be managed for natural recovery. In other areas, such as the interstate right-of-way and at trailheads, the Forest Service is working on reseeding with the Colorado Department of Transportation.
Specific areas will be targeted for recovery.
""Fire suppression lines need help,"" Roberts said.
Places where firebreaks were cut by bulldozers or hand crews, for example, need soil amendments at the least to help natural vegetation grow back. Some of those areas may also need to be seeded.
The Forest Service has also secured funding for trail and road stabilization. Some of the work started last fall and will continue when the snow melts out.
White River National Forest spokesman David Boyd said the agency's tentative plan is to open trails in the canyon, including the popular Hanging Lake, on May 1. Details will be released in March.
The Grizzly Creek and Shoshone rest areas remain closed. The Forest Service wants to coordinate the opening of the trails with those amenities.
A group called the Glenwood Canyon Restoration Alliance has been created to help with the ongoing healing effort.
Hunter told an audience of about 50 people on the Roaring Fork Conservancy video conference that a lot of what unfolds in the Grizzly Creek burn area will depend on weather this summer and other the next three to five years.
The Lake Christine Fire affected Basalt Mountain and surrounding terrain in July 2018. The following August, a localized rainstorm dumped about eight-tenths of an inch of rain on the front side of Basalt Mountain in just 60 minutes, Hunter said. It resulted in mud and debris slides in the upper reaches of the town. The storm didn't affect the areas with the highest burn severity.
""So we kind of dodged it,"" he said.
Christina Medved, director of community outreach for Roaring Fork Conservancy, noted the paradox facing the Grizzly Creek burn area.
""We really need rain because we're in a drought, but what's going to happen (if it rains)?"" she asked.

Black Hills Energy is gearing up to launch its western Puebl.txt,"Black Hills Energy is gearing up to launch its western Puebl
Black Hills Energy is gearing up to launch its western Pueblo County solar project that will generate construction jobs and result in savings for customers when it goes online in 2023.
Gov. Jared Polis and Vance Crocker, Black Hills Energy vice president of Colorado utilities operations, teamed up Thursday to talk about clean energy during a virtual press conference. Polis lauded efforts that will help solve climate change, pointing out Colorado had its three largest fires in state history all in one year.
Polis said renewable energy is, Creating jobs in Southern Colorado, reducing costs for customers, cleaner air, improving our climate and our economy. Really all of these factors are culminating with almost every utility in Colorado, prepared to meet the goal of 80 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2030.
Crocker announced upcoming clean energy vision goals Black Hills is making that involve solar electricity generation and electric vehicle projects. Polis said he applauds the company for its clean energy plan.
I am so excited to join Black Hills in this announcement, Polis said. I launched my candidacy for governor in Pueblo at the only solar-run coffee roaster in the country (Solar Roast Coffee, 226 N. Main St.) and committed to the ambitious goal of saving rate-payer money with 100% renewable energy by As you know, Pueblo  the city, and later the county  was the first in Colorado to embrace a 100% renewable energy commitment, Polis said.
Black Hills new solar project, dubbed Renewable Advantage, will be built in western Pueblo County and will be online in 2023, Crocker said.
When asked about energy rates being higher in Pueblo compared to the rest of the state, and how much of a drop in electric bills will Puebloans see, Crocker mentioned the project is expected to save Black Hills nearly 290,000 Colorado customers $66 million in rates in the 15 years after it goes online. In these tough economic times that weve seen, keeping energy bills stable for our customers is more important than ever, Crocker said.
He said the Renewable Advantage project also will lead to $180 million in direct and indirect economic impact to the region through state, federal and local taxes.
Right now the company is working with the project developer and he did not know exactly when construction will start.
The project is expected to generate 250 construction jobs.
Crocker did not know the exact number of long-term jobs the project would generate. Black Hills has 400 employees in Colorado today.
This will be our companys largest renewable energy project to date, Crocker said. When Renewable Advantage comes online more than half of our total generation mix here in Colorado will be coming from renewable resources, leading to a 70% emissions reduction by 2024 compared to 2005 levels. 
He said Black Hills will be almost there several years ahead of schedule, in meeting the states 80% emissions reduction goal. He said the transition is not only good for our climate, it is good for jobs and economic development in our state. We know our customers want more renewable, Crocker said.
He said Black Hills is investing in community solar gardens which are part of an energy resource plan customers can take advantage of even if they choose not to invest in rooftop solar panels. The company also is seeking Colorado Public Utilities Commission approval for its Ready Electric Vehicle Program which will offer rebates for customers who install electric vehicle charging stations at their homes or businesses.
We retired our last coal plant in 2012, becoming the first Colorado electric utility to be coal free, Crocker said.
Since then weve started three Southern Colorado wind farms (in Huerfano County). We call those Peak View, Bush Ranch One and Bush Ranch Two, which together deliver 150megawatts of capacity to our customers. I am also proud to say the equipment for Bush Ranch Two was made righthere in Pueblo at the Vestas plant, Crocker said.
Weve just barely scratched the surface, Crocker added. We believe Southern Colorado can be a renewable energy capitol of our state.

BLMs new resource management plan for North Fork and region.txt,"BLMs new resource management plan for North Fork and region sparks second suit

Another suit has been filed over the Bureau of Land Management's recently updated resource management plan for lands covered by the Uncompahgre Field Office.
The suit, brought by Western Slope Conservation Center and other conservation groups, alleges the BLM violated environmental laws and agency policies in adopting the plan, which WSCC says opens up 95 percent of the lands in the region to leasing by energy extraction industries at the expense of wilderness and other conservation values. ""Our valley's economy is powered by family farms, orchards, small businesses and local ranchers,"" Scott Braden, interim executive director of the Western Slope Conservation Center, said in a provided statement announcing the lawsuit.
""We insist that the federal government do better to protect our communities and our values and we're grateful that Sen. (Michael) Bennet agrees. Today's legal challenge is an important step toward holding the BLM and this administration accountable to our community, since they failed to do so in their plan."" The WSCC is joined by The Wilderness Society and Wilderness Workshop in bringing the challenge against the BLM's final environmental impact statement and record of decision that support the new resource management plan.
Another set of conservation groups filed suit last month, alleging the resource management plan, which recently saw the first update in about 30 years, is riddled with bad science and falls short of the law's requirements. Those groups are seeking to have the resource management plan, or RMP, stayed. In addition, the state of Colorado filed an administrative protest, as have Gunnison and San Miguel counties, the Town of Paonia, business owners and elected officials such as state Sen. Kerry Donovan and state Rep. Julie McCluskey, who want the plan revised for better protections. The BLM does not comment on pending litigation. The agency said previously the RMP aligns with the Trump administration's priorities for providing access to public lands for multiple uses, while also being responsive to community needs.
The updated and approved RMP excludes the Gunnison Gorge and Dominguez-Escalante National Conservation Area. It updates and combines resource management plans of 1985 and 1989, providing guidance for public land use on 675,800 acres of BLM-administered surface lands and 971,220 acres of federal mineral estate.
The Western Slope Conservation Center and other plaintiffs in the most recent suit say the BLM's record of decision opened up 870,000 acres for oil and gas leasing  95 percent of the area the plan manages  on federal lands in Montrose, Gunnison, Delta, Mesa, Ouray and San Miguel counties. The decision ""threatens the area, which is treasured for its scenic beauty, idyllic towns, organic agriculture, recreational opportunities, clean air and water and abundant wildlife,"" the suit says. In the document, the plaintiffs accuse the federal government of failing to adequately examine and fully disclose the environmental impacts of opening such a broad swath of land to oil and gas.
Instead, the environmental impact statement used to support the decision to adopt the new plan ""ignored key issues and assumed, without rational support, that vague or unsupported mitigation measures will protect certain values and minimize impacts on resources,"" the suit says. Like the previous suit, the WSCC action contends the environmental impact statement failed to fully evaluate climate change issues and greenhouse gas emissions; therefore, it is in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act.
The suit also accuses the BLM of not providing a meaningful range of alternatives for oil and gas development, but of instead offering a narrow range of alternatives that ignored public concerns. Per the suit, the final decision further rejected several protections for special lands, waterways and people that had been included in a draft plan's preferred alternative ""and instead prioritized oil and gas development over all other uses,"" without a rational basis.
The agency also based its decision on factors Congress did not intend to be considered under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the lawsuit contends, calling certain actions ""irrational."" The RMP's approval is arbitrary and capricious and as such, its underpinning decisions should be vacated, with a finding by the court that the Bureau of Land Management violated NEPA, FLPMA and its own policies, the conservation groups say."
Boebert introduces bill to pay for logging raise timber reve.txt,"Boebert introduces bill to pay for logging, raise timber revenue Legislation aims to keep timber profits in rural communities
July 10, 2021  Durango Herald, The (CO)
After Colorado faced its worst fire season on record in 2020, freshman House Rep. Lauren Boebert, RColo., introduced legislation to mitigate wildfires, as the West grapples with devastating burns, heat
waves and drought.
The Active Forest Management, Wildfire Prevention and Community Protection Act would pay for the removal of trees killed by bark beetles and establish Forest Reserve Revenue Areas to sell timber. Boebert, who serves on the House Natural Resources Committee, said in an interview with The Durango Herald that the bill would require the U.S. Forest Service to harvest a minimum of 6 billion board feet of lumber annually.
The logging would reduce wildfires and costs of wildfiresuppression while protecting nearby communities, a strategy that federal agencies have failed to recognize, she said. ""That is a flawed approach, which causes us to spend billions of dollars on the back end to suppress fire, neglecting fire prevention and putting our communities at increasing risk of catastrophic fire,"" she told the Herald.
Twenty-five percent of logging revenue would be retained locally. The bill also would make it harder for groups that oppose forest thinning to take legal measures.
Local funding through timber sales is part of Boebert's effort to ""put rural communities first."" She said she developed the bill to benefit rural communities because state and federal legislation often does not. Coloradans witnessed the state's most active fire season in 2020, when fires burned for a total 100 days and scorched more than 600,000 acres. Three fires set records as the state's largest fires.
In 2021, firefighters are battling several blazes in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona, according to the AirNow Fire and Smoke Map.
""It's a very big issue that impacts our daily lives here,"" she said. ""Look at your commute to work, or to church or to the other side of the state. We have unhealthy forests that are unmanaged, which causes a tinderbox for fires.""
The congresswoman led 16 colleagues in introducing the bill, including fellow Colorado Reps. Ken Buck and Doug Lamborn. All co-sponsors for the legislation are Republican, which could make advancing the bill difficult in a Democratic-majority House.
Boebert said Democrats are ""very supportive until it comes down to actually doing work"" and refuse to work with Republicans. If the bill stalls, Boebert said she would file a discharge petition to bring the proposal out of committee and to the floor for consideration. ""I'm not opposed to working with anyone and everyone to advance policies that actually work for the people, actually benefit our communities,"" she said. She has also spoken to Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet in developing the bill, she said.
No conservation or environmental experts were consulted in crafting the legislation. Boebert likened them to ""extremists who don't want to touch the land or interfere with the land."" ""Aren't we all, are we all environmentalists and conservationists?"" she said in an interview. ""That's what we're here to do. We're here to be good stewards of the land."" The bill is supported by several Colorado and national organizations, including the American Loggers Council, the Colorado Off-Highway Vehicle Coalition and several commissioners in Montrose, Rio Blanco and Garfield counties.

Boulder adjusting climate approach.txt,"Boulder adjusting climate approach
In light of the urgency of climate change, Boulder City Council is on board with city staff's plans to adopt more aggressive climate goals and targets and to shift the way the city thinks about its overall approach. In addition to adjusting its goals, Boulder is arguing that the city must put equity and resilience at the center of the work, while also considering the other dynamics that work to hold the causal factors of climate change in place.
Energy systems, materials consumption and ecosystems -- all causal factors of climate change -- are influenced and shaped by larger forces, including the markets, policy, knowledge and technology, and norms and culture, senior sustainability and resilience policy adviser Brett KenCairn said in a Boulder City Council study session Tuesday.
Given that data from City Scale indicates 8% of local governments in the United States have joined a climate program, it's an important change in thinking, staff said.
""Cities can't do this alone, and the success of a few cities isn't enough,"" senior energy project manager Yael Gichon said.
The city is continuing to determine how best to disrupt some of the systems at play in order to force change on a larger scale. However, Gichon noted Boulder is in a prime position to guide the work, considering it has the resources, the political will and the responsibility to do so since the wealthiest 10% of the world's population are responsible for more than 50% of current emissions, according to a 2015 Oxfam study.
Current science indicates that it's no longer enough to solely focus on reducing carbon emissions. Carbon drawdown also must occur in order to truly impact the changing climate. This change in thinking is part of the reason for Boulder's shift in approach and its desire to become carbon positive by 2040. ""Net zero emissions is balancing any carbon that we emit into the atmosphere by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere,"" Gichon said. ""And carbon positive means that an activity goes beyond achieving those net zero carbon emissions to create an environmental benefit by removing additional carbon from the atmosphere.""
Another big change is that the city is now proposing to compare emissions levels to a 2018 baseline, instead of the original 2005 baseline that had been used.
Sustainability analyst Lauren Tremblay said that's due to guidance from ICLEI -- Local Governments For Sustainability, which is a global network of more than 2,500 local and regional governments committed to sustainable urban development.
ICLEI manages the ClearPath software that Boulder uses for its greenhouse gas inventories and forecasts. It recommended that cities adopt new baselines between 2016 to 2019, Tremblay said.
Mayor Sam Weaver expressed some concerns about that particular change, largely because he worried people might not understand that the city adjusted its baseline and thus that some might assume Boulder's progress had declined. For example, Boulder reports that it's reduced emissions by 21% since 2005. When the baseline changes, so too will that percentage.
He stressed the importance of thoughtful communication.
Additionally, the staff memo states that there is a growing recognition that previous city greenhouse gas inventories did not adequately account for the full scope of emissions associated with the community. The Global Protocol for Community Scale GHG emissions does not require reporting consumptionbased emissions, or those that occur from purchasing goods and materials or food choices. 
""Yet, when examining the overall emissions footprint of a typical city, adding consumption-based emissions may more than double Boulder's currently reported emissions,"" the memo continues.
Weaver said the city must understand its role as an institution when thinking critically about its climate impact. That might mean rethinking its financial processes and considering the ways in which it obtains goods, he noted.
Overall, Councilmember Mark Wallach said he was struck by the thoughtfulness of the memo but found it frightening. He wondered whether Xcel Energy's electric resource plan, which President Alice Jackson presented earlier in the meeting, was reflective of the sense of urgency imbued in the memo.
Xcel Energy's plan, submitted to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission in March, aims to cut carbon emissions 85% by 2030, based on 2005 levels, leaving it behind where Boulder aims to be at that time. In its proposed changes, the city is now striving for an energy system that delivers 100% renewable energy by 2030. It also is proposing a 70% emissions reduction by 2030, based on 2018 levels, and it wants to be net zero by 2035.
Initially, the climate staff representatives were hesitant to answer the question. 
""I would say that it is absolutely a step in the right direction,"" interim director of climate initiatives Jonathan Koehn said. ""We are having a different conversation today with Xcel than we were just two years ago. But we have to continue to push.""
Still, questions remain around Xcel's investment in natural gas, the pace at which the utility company is decommissioning its fossil-based units and the impacts to the communities that Xcel serves, Koehn noted.
The city climate staff intends to return later this summer with a resolution to adopt new climate goals. Later this year it will release a progress report, indicating whether its efforts have been successful. In December, the City Council will review the prioritized set of strategies and talk more about the funding that's necessary to support the work.
The Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan will undergo a major update in 2025, and the city intends to delve into a conversation about land use and its impact on the climate ahead of that time. ""This is going to be an extremely important time for us to look at all the ways that planning and land use shape our ability to both reduce emissions, draw down carbon and prepare our community for all kinds of different climate effects,"" KenCairn said.

Boulder County cleantech companies see demand increasing aft.txt,"Boulder County clean-tech companies see demand increasing after
Days of blistering record heat. Devastating wildfires on the doorstep of Northern Colorado's urban corridor. An overwhelmed power grid in Texas. The headlines tell a story that most scientists contend is all too predictable. But with a new federal administration that takes climate change much more seriously, clean-technology companies in Boulder County see both demand and supportheating up as well.
""Public policy is a signal to the private sector that there's a lot of upside to climate technology,"" said Helen El Mallakh, executive director of the Boulder-based Colorado Cleantech Industries Association. ""We're seeing that the private sector and equity markets and companies are responding to the signal put out by the Biden administration and to public opinion seeing climate threats as a bigger issue now  and responding to the signal of lower-cost technology. There's a lot of potential for climate tech. ""It has helped even the playing field for a lot of renewables,"" she said. ""It has really signaled to the private sector that if you make these investments you will be rewarded  whether it's with electric vehicles, hydrogen solar, wind, energy efficiency or building efficiency. There are plenty of incentives to support these businesses now. There's a lot of alignment in supporting clean-tech and climate-tech companies, a lot of money and investment coming into it. It's a big change from what we saw under the Trump administration.""Peter Lilienthal, chief executive of Boulder-based Homer Energy by UL  a homegrown company that was acquired by Underwriters Laboratories in 2019  described it as a ""day-and-night change, a sea change.
""The previous administration was openly hostile to clean energy,"" he said, adding that the biggest change he sees is in the attitude of the financial community. ""They're anticipating a lot more emphasis on cleanclergy shifting and getting ahead of that."" Business is responding to the climate change in public perception as well, Lilienthal said. ""The fact that you had that mutiny that happened on the board of directors of Exxon is huge,"" he said. ""The private sector sees the handwriting on the wall, and no question that it's incredibly beneficial to clean energy.""
In June alone, Boulder County saw the results of that interest from investors. Boulder-based startup ElectraSteel Inc. reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had attracted $28.25 million to help fund its quest to electrify and decarbonize steel production, which globally accounts for three gigatons of carbon-dioxide emissions a year, or 10% of the worldwide total. Meanwhile, Louisvillebased Solid Power  which builds solid-state batteries for electric vehicles that it says are lighter, lower
cost and longer range  unveiled a plan to go public and trade on Nasdaq through a merger with Riverstone Holdings LLC's Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp. III, a green-focused Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC.
""Lightning eMotors in Loveland just did one of those"" through SPAC, El Mallakh noted. ""It's a way to raise capital for clean-tech companies instead of a traditional IPO."" At Solid Power, said spokesman Will McKenna, ""we decided to take this route because of the speed to enter the market. Running a private company and going back and forth with venture capitalists and strategic investors puts a strain on the team here, really slowing down our production. This allows us to be the only solid-state battery maker with a fully funded business plan.""
Solid Power started in 2014 as a spinoff of University of Colorado Boulder research, and used nondilitive, non-equity-based grants. ""We didn't go out to VC on Day 1 and trade equity for X. We took the more conservative route"" until the batteries passed tests and proved themselves in the marketplace, McKenna said.
McKenna echoed Lilienthal's enthusiasm for the ""climate change"" in the federal government. ""The administration has been a huge help in the small window that they've been in office,"" he said. ""The Department of Energy put out a report to fully bolster local battery manufacturing and everything that goes with it. Solid Power today hasn't reaped the benefits of that yet, but just the thought, time and effort is significant compared with previous administrations."" He said he expects to see expanded grants and funding for climate technology. ""This is not on the back burner any more,"" he said. ""This is a serious issue for the Biden administration, as evidenced by what they're doing with the DOE already. We're likely to see more of this coming down the line.""
El Mallakh pointed to increased federal support for research and development ""which is very important along the Front Range because of our universities and their relation with the climate sector."" She cited funding for rural development and renewable-energy projects as well as line items in the new transportation bill. ""We had a lot of programs in place that were very pro-climate and green-tech, but they weren't well funded,"" she said. ""Now, they are.""
Many companies in Boulder County are well positioned to benefit both from the changes in policy at the federal level and the heightened public interest. One is Lilienthal's Homer Energy by UL, which creates software for designing clean-power systems and integrates storage into them. Another is Boulder-based Uplight, which works with utilities to help smooth out peaks in energy consumption that can cripple power grids. At Louisville-based AMP Robotics, workers develop automated systems to recognize and separate glass, metals, paper and plastics from single-stream recycling so other companies can sell or reuse them.
""We are at a critical tipping point in terms of public support,"" El Mallakh said, ""and the second trend is that the economics behind the technology that will address climate change and provide solutions that are feasible now. Pricing is finally very cost competitive with traditional hydrocarbon solutions. ""One of the biggest misconceptions in the energy sector is that it has to be solar,"" she said. ""Some of these companies are doing amazing things but not what you'd think are traditional. We have a very diverse clean-tech, climate-tech ecosystem.""
At Uplight, said chief operating officer Angela Tucci, the climate mission is to ""help utilities in how they engage with customers to achieve lower consumption and greener options at lower cost.""
An amalgamation of six companies into a larger entity, Tucci said Uplight is in the process of closing on another private-equity investment. It has more than 400 employees and another 40 openings, she said. Tucci said Uplight sells utilities a ""purpose-built, integrated set of offerings helping utilities in their decarbonization journey."" To advance along that journey, she said, ""usage patterns need to change. Use in homes needs to change. If we all drive home with our EVs, plug in and turn on our ACs all at once, think how compounding that is. Utilities don't want to have that happen. They need some predictability and manageability. Utilities have megawatt and gigawatt targets so they don't have to turn on a coal plant  but if we all turn on our air conditioners at once, they have to tap another coal plant. Our software and programs help utilities educate customers on being smarter""  such as using smart thermostats that smooth out home usage, and electric-vehicle charging when demand is lower and thus less costly. ""We help them take customers on a journey from education on through to orchestration of their energy patterns.""
As cases of extreme weather mount, Tucci said, ""increasing grid flexibility is increasingly important. We can have a smart thermostat that talks to an EV to learn how to stagger electric usage  but without inconveniencing the customer, because you can't sacrifice customer comfort and expect it to work."" At AMP Robotics, said Rob Writz, director of commercial partnerships, ""our mission is to pursue a world without waste through developing technology thathelps reduce the cost of sorting for recycling. The company has 140 employees, most of whom work in Boulder, Broomfield and Denver counties, and the majority of whom have been hired in the last year, Writz said. ""Not every community has the same materials they'll accept for recycling,"" he said. ""That complexity drives a lot of the cost in the recycling infrastructure, because a facility needs to sort out paper, metal, glass and plastics that may be commingled.
""Historically, a recycling facility required a lot of manual labor. Each facility often had to bring in 15 to 30 people to sort and ensure the quality of the material. But it was very dangerous, very dirty and very dull  standing there eight hours or more in very hot or cold environments. The machinery and the waste generated heat, too. So they'd tend to be understaffed on every shift, and not able to meet the business objective.""
AMP's robots, Writz said, ""are able to go into those facilities and operate to sort the material but at much higher speeds and much higher accuracy,"" using technology that can perceive objects in that stream similar to how a human would, discerning shapes, logos, and the way objects might crinkle or shine. The robots then pick and place those objects for AMP's customers so they can sell it  customers, he said, that ""all have different markets and quality standards.""
Writz, Lilienthal, El Mallakh and others are keeping a close eye on what comes out of congressional and White House negotiations over an infrastructure bill, because they all see recognition of the need to fight a warming climate that fuels extreme weather events as part of it.
""We certainly look forward to the potential for the recycling infrastructure to be part of the discussion on the federal level,"" Writz said. ""Our infrastructure is ever more dated and aged, and may restrict the supply of recyclable materials to market as demand is increasing  not only because of growth coming out of the pandemic for packaged products for consumers but also companies' commitment to recycling within their packaging. So we want a spotlight on the infrastructure of recycling. We hope the discussion includes that.""
El Mallakh agreed that what comes out of the infrastructure bill is ""one of the biggest issues"" for the clean-tech and climate-tech industry, and some investors may wait to see how that uncertainty is resolved. One thing she's sure of, however, is the solid support the sector has gotten from the state of Colorado.
The state Office of Economic Development and International Trade continues its Advanced Industries Grant Program, which she said ""fosters a lot of solutions in the climate area by providing money to earlystage companies to get them to the next level. It's amazingly effective, especially with companies on the Front Range.""
She also cited an influx of international companies that are eyeing the area. ""They're seeing Colorado as a good place to set up their U.S. offices,"" she said. ""They see the clean-tech and climate-tech ecosystem here and see it as collaborative. They like the location. They like the mindset. Having NREL, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, located here is a big plus for us. They're looking for a very educated population, and a state government that's aligned with that."" Some also move to Colorado from the east or west coasts, she said. ""We're lucky and blessed by the collaborative business climate here that really supports each other. That isn't true all over the U.S., and maybe that's because we didn't have the advantages of a California or a Massachusetts, so we had to work together.""
The Colorado Cleantech Industries Association has multiple roles. ""It advocates at the state level to make sure we have pro-clean-tech policies,"" she said. ""It works with members to provide resources for them to prosper. It provides opportunities for them to network and connect. Ithelps with financing and finding service providers"" including help with accounting, banking and the legalities of protecting intellectual property. ""We also work with the state and OEDIT so that our companies are aware of the programs and have access. We also put on innovation showcase events, putting early-stage innovators in front of larger industry leaders and investors.""
El Mallakh said she'd like to see greater public-private partnerships for financing larger-scale clean-tech ventures, but in general, she's optimistic about the future of climate technology in the area. ""A lot of them want something revolutionary instead of evolutionary,"" she said, ""but the evolutionary ones make the biggest inroads because they're chipping away, chipping away, chipping away  but putting us on a very good path.""

Boulder Countys native bee species thrive in disturbed.txt,"Boulder County's native bee species thrive in disturbed
environments

Until recently, foresters and forest entomologists like Seth Davis, an assistant professor of forest and rangeland stewardship at Colorado State University, largely viewed insects as pests. However, a new study lead by Davis and commissioned by Boulder County Parks and Open Space, shows a strong connection between the diversity of native bee species and how ecosystems recover from disturbances like fire and beetle kill.
""Before I started working in this area I assumed that the study of native bees had been really well fleshed out, but what you find is that the vast majority of it is related to production on agricultural landscape or in  urban landscapes,"" Davis said. ""Typically forest entomologists have treated forest insects only from a negative perspective  bark beetles, bud work, forest diseases and other things which cause damage to forests, but what I'm trying to get people behind is a paradigm shift in this field of research to begin thinking about the beneficial insects in forests and how we can preserve their populations.""
Because different species of bees specialize in pollinating specific plants, its widely accepted a diversebee population translates to a diverse plant population, which increases an area's resiliency to climate change. But Davis' study suggests that in order to maintain these diverse communities there must be a diverse array of habitat, often created by disturbances previously thought to be a blight on the land. ""One of the things we're interested in is what sort of ecosystem services actually benefit from these disturbances because there are a number of studies that show wild bees are equivalent or superior to manage or cultivated honey bees for providing pollination services,"" Davis said. ""What we found ran somewhat contrary to what I expected to happen.""
Going into the study, most research suggested native bee species did best in thinned forests where the understory had better access to sunlight and nutrients. While that's true for some of the 57 unique bee species Davis recorded in his study, he found others that flourished in overgrown forests, while still others thrived in forests decimated by beetle kill or in forests scoured by fire.
""This study showed that if you want to have the greatest number of bee species and the greatest abundance of bees, then you need a mosaic of different habitat types,"" he said. ""Where there's a lot of downed wood like you might find after a fire or a bark beetle outbreak, this is probably creating additional nesting habitat and refugia for bees, which helps regenerate the understory flora.""
Those understory plants, particularly shrubs and legumes, then help sequester nitrogen into the soil and re-grow the trees. The more diverse the bee population, the better chance the environment has for regrowing these key plant species. ""On a very pragmatic basis for humans, having really diverse pollinator communities is kind of like insurance for climate change,"" said Adrian Carper, a postdoctoral student of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Colorado Boulder who specializes in bee populations. ""Say climate change results in some species being lost because they can no longer tolerate the temperatures within that floral community, but if there are a whole bunch of other species, chances are that one of them will be able to take the place of a pollinator.""
As a result of building a data set for native bee populations, Boulder County Open Space can now begin to adjust its land management practices to conserve these wild bee populations.
For example, following the 2013 floods, Boulder County dispatched crews to clean up all wood washed up on the floodplain and burn it. But, because about one-third of the roughly 550 bee species known to live in Boulder County nest in dead wood, Carper proposed a study on how different communities managed the washed-up wood and the effects of native bee populations. ""What we found was that the more wood that was left on the landscape, the higher the diversity was for the entire bee community, not just the wood nesting bees,"" Carper said. ""We're still exploring some of the mechanisms that could be driving that  like it could be indirect benefits from nutrient cycling  but its a very interesting observation.""
While Boulder County Parks and Open Spaces, already employs this philosophy of creating a mosaic of different tree populations across the landscape, moving forward, Boulder County's Senior Forestry Resource Specialist, Stefan Reinold, said the departments will continue to reassess their practices as more data is compiled and a deeper understanding of the ecological impacts of native bee populations is grasped.

Boulder ending contract with director of climate initiatives.txt,"Boulder ending contract with director of climate initiatives

Boulder at the end of 2020 will end its contract with Steve Catanach, who for the past five years has worked on the city's efforts to form its own electric utility and most recently led the climate initiatives department.
Jonathan Koehn, who currently serves as Boulder's chief sustainability and resilience officer, will take over as interim director of the department while Boulder works on its strategic climate plan and decides on a path forward. In a statement shared by Emily Sandoval, who works in media relations for Boulder's climate initiatives department, Koehn said he's learned a lot over the years by working with various climate experts in the community.
""I am eager to continue our department's critical role in addressing the climate crisis, while designing collaborative and transformative solutions,"" Koehn said in the statement. As far as next steps, Communications and Engagement Director Sarah Huntley said there are several avenues the city could take. Interim City Manager Chris Meschuk could appoint Koehn to the permanent position. The city also could decide to post a job listing, to which Koehn and other candidates could apply.
Either way, Huntley expects the city to announce those steps in the second quarter of 2021. It's unclear how much Catanach knew of the city's plans, but Huntley said ""whenever you have somebody in a contract position, they fully understand that they're not a permanent employee."" She said the city always planned to reconsider the contract, which ends this year, after last month's election. Voters approved a 20-year franchise with Xcel Energy. Although there are a few exit opportunities, the vote ended for now Boulder's decade-long effort to form its own municipal electric utility.
In a separate statement from Sandoval, Catanach said it's been an honor to work for Boulder and with the climate team. ""I'm confident that the outstanding group of individuals working to address our climate emergency will lead Boulder, the state and the country towards new and innovative ideas and initiatives,"" Catanach said in the statement.
Huntley said the city was attracted to Catanach's extensive knowledge about electric distribution and the system as a whole. He has more than three decades of experience in the electric utility industry. Catanach joined Boulder as a consultant in 2015 before being brought on as a contract employee in Moving forward, Boulder could continue to use his services. ""It's, in fact, possible that if we continue to need his technical know-how and insight that we could continue to contract with him as a consultant as part of the (Xcel) partnership,"" "
Boulder finding success in climate initiatives.txt,"Boulder finding success in climate initiatives
A new report shows Boulder found success in a number of its climate initiatives, including its effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, the city reported a 21% reduction in emissions since 2005, surpassing its goal for 2020. According to the 2019 report, cleaner electricity and a reduction in electricity consumption as well as reduced emissions from on-road transportation and solid waste all drove the reduction. Other recent accomplishments include the installation of more than 14 megawatts of residential and commercial solar, participation of 125 residential units and 100 businesses in city-supported efficiency programs and recycling and composting 50% of Boulder's waste.
In July 2019, the Boulder City Council declared a climate emergency, which led to the creation of the Climate Mobilization Action Plan that directs Boulder's path forward. The city is continuing its push, hoping to reduce emissions by at least 80% by 2050 and to power the city with 100% renewable energy by 2030.
While Boulder pushes initiatives and provides incentives for participation, success would be a challenge without buy-in from Boulder residents. ""The reality is fighting climate change is everyone's responsibility,"" Boulder's Chief Sustainability and Resilience Officer Jonathan Koehn said. ""Boulder has had a very long history of engaging in climate action at the local level.  The city, its role in all of that, is to design programs and strategies to support that collective action that takes place in the community."" Boulder cannot solve the global climate crisis on its own, but Koehn is hopeful the city is leading the way and creating a model that can be replicated elsewhere.
Work to be done
While the city successfully reduced greenhouse gas emissions, there is still work to be done. Natural gas usage increased by 11% since 2005, and emissions from the Boulder Municipal Airport increased by 36% since the airport is being used more.
There also is work to be done in terms of equity. According to the Equitable and Just National Climate Platform, systemic racism and injustice have left communities of color and other marginalized communities exposed to the highest levels of toxic pollution and make those communities more vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters that are becoming more prevalent as the Earth warms. Boulder city staff members insist equity will be a guiding force moving forward. Koehn said community working groups indicated the need for this, considering marginalized communities historically haven't had a say in advising climate initiatives in Boulder despite being disproportionately impacted by climate change.
Tim Beal, director of Sustainable Communities with Boulder Housing Partners, said he's already working to impact equity by providing alternative energy for the housing authority's affordable housing projects. A 3.8-acre solar garden is under construction in North Boulder next to the Gateway Park Fun Center. The $1.2 million project that serves solely low-income households is the first of its kind in Boulder. Beal hopes it will ""level the playing ground.""
Boulder Housing Partners estimates the solar garden will provide a $647,237 energy cost savings over 20 years that will be used to lower operating expenses and provide utility savings for residents. The housing authority partnered with GRID Alternatives Colorado, a Denver-based company that installs solar electric systems for income-qualified households and affordable housing providers.
Moving forward
Despite the progress made in 2019, it's possible some of the work could plateau due to the extenuating circumstances of 2020. ""We're in kind of an anomaly of a year. It's going to be hard to look at 2020 as any basis of trends,"" Boulder sustainability analyst Lauren Tremblay said. Still, city staff said there are lessons to be learned. ""We don't know what the numbers, in terms of emissions, are going to look like 2020. Regardless of what those numbers turn out to be, there are lessons that we have learned from this pandemic that will be shaping our climate action moving forward,"" city spokesperson Emily Sandoval said."
Boulder mayors conversation calls for action against climate.txt,"Boulder mayor's conversation calls for action against climate
change

Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of Vadim Uzdensky's name, a Fairview High School student who spoke during the event. Helping Boulder become a leader in sustainability while fighting climate change was on the minds of the nearly 100 people that packed the West Boulder Senior Center Saturday for the Mayor's Community Conversation on Climate and Local Clean Energy.
Boulder Mayor Sam Weaver helped lead the discussion alongside Leslie Glustrom, of Clean Energy Action . The audience heard from state legislators about climate change initiatives, an expert in microgrids and city and county leaders about local efforts. They also learned about daily practices to reduce their carbon footprint, like reducing food waste.
The conversational forum follows continued efforts from Boulder to acquire its own power system. Weaver gave people an update on the situation and talked about how municipal energy could be key to the city's goals on climate change action. ""Right now we can't go out and say we want energy from a wind farm only or we want energy from a solar farm,"" Weaver said.
Since 2011, the city of Boulder has been lobbying to have control of its own energy operations. Xcel Energy currently provides the city with natural gas and electricity. Giving the audience an update Saturday, Weaver said the city is in condemnation court to determine what the final price tag for purchasing Xcel's electric assets could be.
The court action was necessary after Xcel ignored the city's offer requests, Weaver said. A condemnation was filed last year, but dismissed by Xcel in September. The city refiled the condemnation in December. Weaver said he expects to hear results in fall, with the hopes of asking voters this year or next to approve continued efforts for a municipal power project.
In front of a picture of raging fires that have impacted California in recent years, Weaver talked about his concerns for assuring electricity infrastructure is safe and sustainable for its users. He cited 1,500 fires in the past six years in California, which he said was caused by poor maintenance of power transmission and distribution systems.
""It's deadly serious business,"" Weaver said. ""When power gets out of control, your transformer blows up, your lines go down in a wind storm  these fires kill people."" In addition to assuring protections to consumers, Weaver said city management of power operations would allow Boulder to manage its own utilities with the aim to give consumers choice in clean energy options.
""We ask for and say that we deserve as a city to have public input into the way our distribution system is planned or resilience or solar or microgrids and I don't think that's an unreasonable request,"" Weaver said. ""How do we get their attention? We keep going with the municipalization effort because they understand that effort is what brings power to the people. If the investor on utilities in Colorado is willing to power share, awesome. And if they're not we say, 'leave us alone.'"" This was met with a burst of applause from the audience.
The city's final offer for Xcel's electric utility assets was nearly $94 million. In prior reports, Xcel spokesperson Michelle Aguayo said the power company is seeking to ""achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, which aligns with Boulder's clean energy priorities.""
On Saturday, council members Junie Joseph and Mary Young also touched on the city's partnership with the University Colorado Boulder to form the Just Transition Collaborative efforts to understand the energy, sustainability and climate impact needs of lower income and disenfranchised people. Sitting in the crowd Saturday was Vadim Uzdensky, a sophomore at Fairview High School. Uzdensky had homework waiting for him, buthe chose to spend a part of his morning listening in on the conversation.
""I am very concerned about climate change and I've been hearing talk and efforts to spread awareness, but it's time for actual action,"" Uzdensky said.
During the presentations, Uzdensky stood up to ask what progress Boulder has made to eliminate dependency on fossil fuels.
Young said one example is a solar garden created for Ponderosa Moble Home Park, an area damaged by the 2013 flood. The property was annexed to the city and will contain affordable housing. The power generated from the solar garden will offset utility costs for residents. She also cited plans to build energyefficient homes. In 2018, the city created a Climate Mobilization Action Plan, which outlines goals to reach 100% renewable electricity by 2030 and an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050.
Reflecting on the forum Saturday, Uzensky said what most caught his attention was Lili Francklyn's presentation on microgrids. Franklyn, the editor for Microgrid News, talked about how microgrids are energy-efficient and can also use locally generated power. Uzensky said he had notheard of the power sources before and saw them as a model that could be beneficial to the city or his school as a source of power.
Weaver said he hopes for Saturday's forum to be the first in a series that will educate and give residents a chance to be part of the conversation on local climate change efforts. ""I just love the fact that we had almost 100 people come out to spend three hours on a Saturday to talk about climate change and energy,"" Weaver said.

Boulder recognized by nonprofit for climate action reporting.txt,"Boulder recognized by nonprofit for climate action, reporting
efforts

Boulder received an award from an international nonprofit for the city's work on environmental issues and transparency about its climate action, officials announced in a news release Thursday. The city earned a spot on nonprofit CDP's ""A-list"" of cities, the release said. To score an A, a city must keep a city-wide emissions inventory, set an emissions reduction target, have published a climate action plan and have completed a climate adaptation plan to lay out how it will address current and future climate hazards.
""I am proud the city achieved this recognition because we need collective action to address the systemic issues we face as a planet,"" Boulder Sustainability Analyst Lauren Tremblay stated in the release. ""Being transparent about the threats we face and what we plan to do about them through CDP disclosures can open up possibilities for the type of collaborative action needed to affect real change."" 
Boulder's work on its reporting efforts in the last year to develop climate change strategies, track and act to limit and reduce planet-warming emissions, assess and mitigate climate risks and include disclosures of such 2019 information to CDP was specifically recognized, the release said.
""Congratulations to Boulder,"" Katie Walsh, Head of Cities, States and Regions for CDP North America, stated in the release. ""They are demonstrating how municipal governments can safeguard citizens in the face of our new environmental reality and build a climate-safe future. We look forward to seeing other cities follow Boulder's lead.""
City greenhouse gas emissions data is available on the city's open data dashboard, Boulder Measures, at bouldercolorado.gov/boulder-measures/community-greenhouse-gas-emissions. Boulder since 2005 has reduced emissions by 18% as the city's population and GDP grew, according to the release. Boulder's target is to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050.

Boulder rethinking climate approach.txt,"Boulder rethinking climate approach
With the understanding that addressing climate change must be a collective effort and a sense of urgency brought on by a rapidly changing climate, Boulder is shifting its climate action approach and will bring forth more stringent goals and targets. ""Scientists tell us that we have until 2030 to make the massive, societal, systems-scale changes required to stave off the worst effects of climate change,"" the staff memo for Tuesday's study session states. ""While the situation is urgent, we are also in an incredibly inspiring moment.""
Moving forward, staff is proposing a resolution with the city's new climate goals later this summer before presenting a progress report in the fall. In December, staff intends to return with a prioritized list of climate action strategies and funding strategies that could support the work. The city has a climate action plan tax, which generates about $1.8 million a year, but it will sunset in 2023 so other funding options are being considered.
There have been several iterations of the city's climate plan, first adopted in 2006. Most recently, staff in 2019 proposed a 2030 Climate Mobilization Action Plan that was meant to be a more aggressive 10-year plan to address climate change. However, that work slowed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Boulder City Council will hear more about the updated approach on Tuesday in a study session. ""There's a very strong recognition that we need to broaden our thinking beyond just mitigating emissions,"" Boulder's Director of Climate Initiatives Jonathan Koehn said.
There is a growing recognition that previous city greenhouse gas inventories did not adequately account for the full scope of emissions associated with the community, the staff memo states. The Global Protocol for Community Scale GHG emissions does not require reporting consumption-based emissions, or those that occur from purchasing goods and materials or food choices. ""Yet, when examining the overall emissions footprint of a typical city, adding consumption-based emissions may more than double Boulder's currently reported emissions,"" the memo continues. Boulder is shifting its approach and considering its role as a city, but it also is rethinking some of its climate targets, centered on three main focus areas: energy systems, circular materials economy and regenerative ecosystems. For example, it is aiming for an energy system that delivers 100% renewable electricity by 2030; becoming a zero-waste city by 2025; and ultimately removing 50,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030 through forest, urban tree and soil landscape restoration.
Beyond that, Boulder is recognizing that climate change can not be tackled by the city alone. It requires a ""systems approach"" and an understanding that everything changes quickly, the city's climate staff said. ""Whether we like it or not, this system is changing,"" Senior Sustainability and Resilience Policy Advisor Brett KenCairn said. ""It's going to change more and in more ways that we don't like because the momentum of climate change is now in place.""
When KenCairn joined the city in 2013, people continued to argue about whether climate change was a legitimate problem. ""We're barely catching up to the reality that we're now living in,"" he said.

Boulder schedules forum to kick off neighborhood climate.txt,"Boulder schedules forum to kick off neighborhood climate
planning program
Boulder next weekend is hosting a virtual climate forum for residents across the city. The demonstrative forum on Nov. 14 kicks off a neighborhood-level engagement process and will inform residents about a pilot program where Boulder in 2021 plans to support three neighborhoods in creating individual climate action plans tailored to each community's goals.
To do this, the city contracted with Accelerate Neighborhood Climate Action, or ANCA, a Denver-based organization designed to create climate action on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood level. ANCA representatives will take part in next Saturday's forum and help guide the process moving forward. The neighborhood climate action plans emphasize individual and community efforts. David Ensign, resident and forum planning committee volunteer, said the program is perfect for a community such as Boulder, where people ""have shown a very high level of local action."" ""They like to jump in and support the city of Boulder's climate action plans, policies,"" he said. ""We do need, of course, very good public policy to address our climate change challenges, but individual action is a huge part of that as well.""
The plans will be unique to the neighborhood. Ensign said each climate action plan can range from simple, inexpensive tasks such as coordinating days where residents commit to riding the bus, biking or walking to work to larger, more expensive ones such as a particular home committing to install a geothermal heating system and then sharing information about it with the neighborhood.
On a city level, Boulder will be there to provide support. 
""The city's here to support individual and community action and not be at the center of this work,"" Boulder Sustainability Coordinator Elizabeth Vasatka said. The city sees it as a means of promoting community while advancing its climate goals. ""We're excited to offer  even in a pandemic, even in a particularly divisive time in national politics  an opportunity for community building around a topic that is as urgent and important as climate change,"" said Emily Sandoval, city spokesperson.
Vasatka agreed, noting she's hopeful the forum will build neighborhood unity. ""If you know your neighbors, you're more apt to help your neighbors,"" she said. While Boulder has limited resources through ANCA, Vasatka said it's committed to continuing the work. Three pilot neighborhoods will be selected, but Boulder intends to support any that show interest. It's just a matter of timing, and the work may need to be spread out.
To be selected for the 2021 pilot, neighbors should discuss interest and attend the Nov. 14 forum. Then they'll be required to submit an interest form to be reviewed by the city's climate initiatives team and ANCA and will be informed of acceptance by the end of the year. Once selected, neighborhoods work with the city and ANCA to develop climate action plans before having a virtual forum with their neighborhood. The initial Nov. 14 event will be held virtually. It begins with a morning session from 9:30 a.m. to noon with vision-setting sessions and presentations from local climate experts. Guests then break for lunch before returning for an afternoon session from 2 to 4:30 p.m. where they will identify action areas and get to know each other."

May 27, 2021  FOX - 31 KDVR (Denver, CO)  Web Staff
BOULDER COUNT Y, Colo. (KDVR)  Scientists are predicting another intense wildfireseason similar to the one in 2020.
With that in mind, Boulder County says it is boosting its investment and work with partners and communities to prepare for large, long-duration wildfires occurring at higher elevations and in different vegetation types than previously seen.
The Calwood Fire (October 2020) burned over 10,000 acres in Boulder County, the largest in county history, while the Cameron Peak fire 15 miles north of the Boulder County line burned over 200,000 acres -- the largest in Colorado history.
Boulder County Fireshed
A coalition of federal, state, county and municipal agencies are working closely with Boulder County nonprofits to meet with communities and prioritize areas for treatments. The coalition aims to ensure county forests will be healthier and better able to withstand the effects of wildfire.
Health and community protection efforts
In the heart of this watershed, Button Rock Preserve is the primary water source for 100,000 domestic water users in the county and provides regional recreation to over 60,000 visitors annually. The watershed includes Allenspark, Lyons and the City of Longmont, which are all participating in the partnership.
Boulder Watershed Collective
The Boulder Watershed Collective is working with communities, fire districts and agency partners within the Boulder Creek Watershed.
The collective hopes to increase its knowledge about forest ecology and wildfire adapted ecosystems, build capacity within communities to plan and implement more forestry projects across land ownership and identify gaps to reduce wildfire risk at the community and landscape scale.
The town of Gold Hill, the Gold Hill Fire District, Boulder Valley Conservation District, and the Colorado State Forest Service are working together to begin a 100-acre forest restoration project this summer. The town has used this project to galvanize momentum for future project planning and are taking a community-oriented approach to completing home hardening and defensible space on private properties.
City of Boulder
The city is implementing projects at multiple scales to address the risks of wildfire to the community. After the 2020 fire season, the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks department has dedicated additional budget in 2021 to increase staffing and expand thinning efforts to address wildfire risk in the city's wildland-urban interface.
The city has plans to thin over 200 acres in the Shanahan Ridge, Chautauqua and Sunshine Canyon areas during 2021. This is in addition to the over 2,000 acres of thinning completed in past years.
Within city limits, the Boulder Fire Department's Wildland Division has a Wildfire Home Assessment Program that can help property owners identify risks and mitigate threats on their private property.
On a broader scale, the City Utilities Department is working on larger collaborative foresthealth projects to address fire risk in the Middle Boulder Creek Watershed to protect drinking water supplies for Boulder and Nederland.
City of Longmont
The City of Longmont is currently performing a 40-acre forest stewardship thinning project in Button Rock Preserve just west of Ralph Price Reservoir.
Wood harvested during this project will be utilized in aerial mulching in the CalWood Fire burn area in coordination with Boulder County and other agency partners.
Colorado State Forest Service (CSFS)
On May 10, the CSFS officially launched The Home Ignition Zone (HIZ), which is a guide to prepare homes for wildfire and create defensible space. The HIZ takes into account both the potential of the home or structure to ignite and the quality of nearby defensible space.
residents and others to help reduce wildfire risk to that community.
Roosevelt National Forest , Boulder Ranger District
As part of this effort, the National Forest , in partnership with Boulder County Wildfire Partners, recently outreached to residents who are interested in creating defensible space around their homes and is now processing 13 applications from neighbors that will allow them to remove trees along their National Forest boundaries.
In addition to 400 acres of prescribed pile burning across the district over the past winter and spring, the forest will complete thinning projects across nearly 600 acres associated with the Forsythe II Project this summer.
This work will reduce the density of trees in thickly forested stands while also enhancing aspen. These types of projects are important in helping the remaining trees thrive, while returning the forest to a more fire-resilient condition.
Finally, the forest is actively engaging with partners to plan and implement fire recovery efforts on both the Calwood and Lefthand Fires .
Boulder County
Calwood Fire recovery efforts are fully underway with funding from the Emergency Watershed Protection program from the Natural Resources Conservation Service.
Aerial wood mulching on about 1,700 acres is being completed in order to decrease the chances of erosion and debris flows, while flooding/debris mitigation structures will be built to minimize damages from increased run off.
The county, through its Parks and Open Space (BCPOS) department, is gearing up to complete a 100-acre thinning project on the Sherwood Gulch property west of Nederland.
BCPOS is also applying for grant funding to complete 76 acres of treatment at Hall Ranch adjacent to a 40-acre project planned by the City of Longmont. BCPOS in cooperation with the Boulder County Sheriff's Office is planning on completing prescribed fire on up to 350 acres at Ron Stewart Preserve at Rabbit Mountain and has 800+ acres earmarked for prescribed fire at Hall Ranch over the next few years.

Linda Burt watched the CalWood fire exploding from her home northwest of Jamestown in Boulder County Saturday and started packing her car.
""My husband thought I was being a little overly cautious by loading up the car with stuff,"" she said looking back at the effort Monday.
The fire was ignited by an unknown source close to Burt's home, but high winds pushed the blaze away from the property, leading her husband to think they would not have to leave. But on Sunday the Left Hand Canyon Fire broke out a mile east of Ward -- much closer to the Burt's residence -and she knew they would have to get out, she said.
After living in the mountains for 34 years, Burt said she had thought about what she would need in a wildfire evacuation long before she was notified to leave.
""You think about those things you would want to take if you might not have a home,"" she said.
Burt and other evacuees were hopeful Monday their houses would survive after cooler temperatures and higher humidly helped to slow the fires and clear the air. The calmer weather also allowed crews to drop water and retardant on the CalWood and Left Hand Canyon fires and helped ground crews to make good progress putting in fire line, a Facebook post from fire officials reported.
As of Monday, the CalWood fire 's rapid growth has consumed 8,788 acres, destroyed least 20 homes, triggered thousands of evacuations, and sent ash raining down on nearby communities such as Nederland. The smaller Left Hand Canyon Fire compounded the stress for many.
""Everybody had cars packed,"" said Nanby Wentzel, who lives outside Nederland and works in the town.
She went to work Monday with her car full of suitcases, important documents and photos of her children. She also put in the crates for her six dogs and three cats should she need to use them.
""I have all the carriers all stacked like Legos in the back of my car,"" she said.
For Wentzel it was surreal to go back to work in the Rustic Moose, a gift shop, and see tourists come in to browse.
""This weekend it was just apocalyptic and then I come down here and everything seems normal,"" she said Monday.
At the Boulder Creek Lodge many of the guests weren't tourists but frazzled evacuees who left their homes Sunday after the Left Hand Canyon fire started. The Red Cross paid for the lodging of
some guests and that's been helpful, evacuee Max Savich said.
Savich said he was ready to go before he got the call Sunday thathe needed to leave his home south of Ward, a town that was completely evacuated. His home is only a few miles from the Left Hand Canyon Fire that is only 4% contained.
""I want to go back as fast as I can,"" he said.
Living with fire danger is a risk some residents in and near Nederland said they are willing to accept.
""That's a price you pay for living in the mountains,"" Wentzel said.
But Cara Judea Alhadeff, who had ash raining down on her home near Nederland over the weekend, said raging wildfires, hurricanes, flooding and other extreme weather events driven by climate change shouldn't be shrugged off as acceptable risks.
""This is a climate crisis. ... We have got to be courageous to see how we can work together to change our lifestyles and how we can have an impact on corporate culture,"" said Alhadeff, a climate justice activist.
The CalWood fire had damaged 26 homes, including 22 that were gutted since it ignited Saturday afternoon, according to the Boulder Office of Emergency Management.
The fire reached 8,788 acres and remained at 15% containment Monday. Damage assessment Monday revealed no additional structure loss, although the west edge of the blaze was still too active to assess, officials said. The Left Hand Canyon Fire had burned 320 acres as of Monday.
The Boulder County fires are among the most recent of several burning around the state.
The Cameron Peak blaze, the largest wildfire in Colorado history, surpassed 204,000 acres amid gusty winds Monday, according to an official fire information website.
The fire's activity increased Monday, causing firefighters to lose containment from 62% to 51%, reports showed. The fire, burning west of Fort Collins and north of Rocky Mountain National Park, has been raging for more than two months with extensive growth in the past week.
Officials said some structures were lost Sunday. The Larimer County Sheriff's Office was assessing the extent of the damage.
The East Troublesome fire burning in Grand County near Granby has consumed 13,364 acres since it erupted Wednesday and was 10% contained, according to a news release.
As many as 231 firefighters were working to make fire lines with the help of bulldozers and air support dropping water and retardant, officials said.
Another wildfiresparked in Colorado on Monday Ice Lake Basin trailhead, a popular hiking trail in
the San Juan mountains, The Durango Herald reported.
The fire was estimated to be burning across 15 to 20 acres. As many as 18 hikers are to be airlifted from the nearly 9 mile-long trail that reaches about 11,000 feet in elevation and features two alpine lakes, Island Lake and Ice Lake. South Mineral Creek Campground on Forest Service Road 585, which leads up to the trailhead, is also being evacuated.

February 10, 2021  Colorado Daily (Boulder, CO)  Kelsey Hammon
The Boulder County Sheriff's Office announced Wednesday that the cause of the Calwood Fire is unknown, based on physical evidence and interviews.
According to a news release from the Boulder County Sheriff's Office, its months-long investigation included interviews with people who fought and fled the fire.
While investigators were able to determine the fire started within an area with a 500-foot radius, no known cause could be established for the blaze that was first reported to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office Communications Center at 12:06 p.m. Oct. 17.
The Lefthand Canyon Fire's cause remains under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service. That fire broke out Oct. 18.
Sheriff's detectives began their investigation into the cause and origin of the Calwood Fire immediately after assisting with the evacuations of homes in the path of the blaze, the release said.
The Calwood Fire, the county's largest fire in its history, started as a one-acre wildfire, near the Cal-Wood Education Center off County Road 87, and grew quickly. Fed by dry conditions and strong west winds, the fire consumed nearly 1,000 acres per hour. Homes across the county and as far away as Hygiene were evacuated.
Between the Calwood, Lefthand Canyon and Cameron Peak fires in Larimer County, the Boulder County Communications Center sent evacuation orders to 4,925 contacts and evacuation warnings to 4,773 contacts, according to the release. It's not clear what the time frame was for the orders and warnings.
The Calwood Fire was contained on Nov. 14, nearly a month after it first sparked. The fire burned 10,113 acres, which was determined after authorities conducted a burn severity map that initially showed the fire burned 10,105 acres. The blaze destroyed 20 homes. A total of 27 properties were impacted by the fire , including two homes identified as damaged/intact and an additional two properties listed as vacant, undeveloped land, according to a list of damaged structures released by the Boulder Office of Emergency Management.
Of the acres burned, 4,658 were county property; 3,634 were National Forest land; 430 were private land and 1,389 were count conservation easements, according to prior reporting.
The day after the Calwood Fire began burning, another fire, the Lefthand Canyon Fire, also sparked.
That fire was reported at 12:30 p.m. Oct. 18, when the Communications Center received a report of a second wildfire outside of Ward. The blaze burned a total 460 acres, according to the Boulder Emergency Operations Center. The fire was contained on Oct. 22.
Investigators do not believe that the Calwood and Lefthand Canyon fires are related, according to the release. The estimated cost of resources spent on the incidents is $6.6 million, the release said. No one died in either fire .
Sheriff's investigators assisted with early portions of the Lefthand Canyon Fire investigation. The entire investigation, however, is being handled by the U.S. Forest Service at this time, the release said.
An estimated 967 animals were sheltered between the Boulder County Fairgrounds, Longmont Humane Society, the Humane Society of Boulder Valley, private homes and Gilpin County services.
In coordination with the American Red Cross, approximately 1,800 people were sheltered in eight different hotels. This number includes evacuees from surrounding wildfires outside of Boulder County that were occurring at the same time, the release said.
As the fires grew, resources from nearly every first responder agency in Boulder County arrived to assist with the suppression efforts, evacuations and roadblocks. The Type III Boulder Incident Management Team and the Type II Team Black Incident Management Team were also activated for the fires.
The Boulder County Multi-Agency Fire Investigation Team, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also participated in the investigation.

Facing a worsening wildfire predicament, Colorado leaders on Thursday braced for more big burns and declared they're shifting state strategy and millions of taxpayer dollars toward early detection and aggressive rapid response to squelch flames before they spread.
More aerial assets including a $24 million helicopter, prepositioning of air tankers that haul water and fire -snuffing slurry, and increased teamwork among local, state and federal agencies have placed Colorado in what officials described as an unprecedented state of readiness.
RELAT ED: ""They're getting bigger, faster"": Colorado braces for what's next after last year's explosive wildfires
""Colorado used to talk about a fire season. It is now a year-round phenomenon,"" Gov. Jared Polis said after a meeting of federal and state authorities, referring to the impacts of climate change.
""We expect dry conditions to make this fire season especially challenging. ... I want everybody to get involved and do their part to prevent wildfires in Colorado communities,"" he said.
And fires that burn in forests and other natural areas threaten the state economically, he said. ""They're critical to attracting hundreds of thousands of tourists every year... Our outdoor areas have been a sanctuary for us during this pandemic.""
This Colorado tilt toward fighting fire rather than living with it carries risks of throwing already ailing forests and grasslands more out of balance. Wildfire plays an essential role in nature, crucial for regeneration and species diversity. State and federal officials on Thursday acknowledged a deepening ecological dilemma and lagging long-planned foresthealth work that could increase resilience in forests so that wildfires would burn less severely.
But hotter and drier conditions increasingly favor big burns. The core ""wildfireseason"" in the state has increased by 78 days since the 1970s, officials said, with fires breaking out even in freezing temperatures. And human population expansion into burn zones -- Polis pointed to some 300,000 houses built in woods requiring ""perimeter defense"" against wildfire -- increasingly constrains what land managers can do.
Colorado officials are prioritizing wildfiresuppression, said Jacque Buchanan, deputy regional director for the U.S. Forest Service.
""There's no leeway"" and nature ""is pushing us,"" Buchanan said, referring to ""high population areas"" near federally-managed forests where ""the quicker you put it out"" the better for people.
""We cannot let up on forest treatments, the fuels reduction. But the reality is -- and last year was a slap upside the head -- we have a lot of things at risk and we've got to deal with the current reality,"" she said.
State officials said budgetary shifting will direct roughly $15 million more of the annual wildfirerelated spending approved by lawmakers toward rapid response and suppression as soon as fires are detected. A $24 million modified military helicopter called a Firehawk with 1,000-gallon tanks and a retractable tube for quick re-filling from ponds is expected to be ready by June 2022. This year, state officials are spending $3 million to deploy a similar helicopter for aggressive ""initial attack"" against wildfires.
Two early-warning airplanes that Colorado purchased in 2015 have detected more than 400 small wildfires, enabling local firefighters to extinguish flames before they became newsworthy, said Mike Morgan, director of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control.
""We want to fight fires when they are small. We want to be aggressive in how we attack them to keep them small,"" Morgan said.
The rising overall spending to deal with intensifying wildfires ""is a lot of money, but when you look at the $285 million"" spent scrambling to contain record-size megafires in 2020 and the damages these cause, a strategy of snuffing small fires before they grow ""is saving money in the long run,"" Morgan said.
Climate warming, forest fuel buildup due to past wildfiresuppression, increasing aridity, and more people living and working near forests has led to more frequent and larger wildfires in Colorado.
Among the state's 20 largest wildfires, 15 occurred since 2012. Last year's fires -- including the three biggest in the state's recorded history -- burned 667,000 acres. The Cameron Peak Fire burned 208,913 acres, or about 326 square miles, and damaged 469 buildings, 224 of them homes.
At least 5,300 wildfires broke out in Colorado during 2020, federal authorities said. Of these, 5,284 went out naturally or were snuffed by firefighters before they grew.
Federal and state forestry experts long have advocated increased work to improve the health of insect-ravaged forests -- selective tree-thinning, logging and use of prescribed fire -- as the most cost-efficient way to revitalize degraded terrain and reduce the severity of wildfires.
Colorado officials on Thursday said ""mitigation"" to help keepinevitable wildfires manageable will be just as important as firefighting. State forester Mike Lester pointed to planned projects that would restore patchy, multispecies forests strategically to help protect communities.
Forest tree-thinning must continue, Morgan said. However, prescribed fires this year likely must be limited, depending on wind and spring rain, he said.
""We don't anticipate that the weather conditions and the drought conditions are going to be favorable to do a lot of prescribed fire on the landscapes for mitigation.""

Breckenridge protest symbolizes lives lost to climate change.txt,"Breckenridge protest symbolizes lives lost to climate change
Attendees of a climate change protest in Breckenridge on Monday Dec. 14, stood behind pairs of shoes to symbolize 73 climate-change-related deaths in Colorado. Members of a Colorado Mountain College sustainability group held signs and chanted, ""No coal, no oil, keep our carbon in the soil"" between speeches from students and professors. The inspiration for the shoes was a 2018 brief from the Natural Resources Defense Council stating that ""high smog and particle pollution levels contributed to an estimated 73 excess deaths and 153 excess illnesses in Colorado between 2013 and 2015.""
The protest was organized by Julia Whinston, who is part of the Summit Sustainability Club, which was formed last December and also serves as a branch of the international group Extinction Rebellion. ""We started organizing some protests just to bring awareness; that was the whole intention behind the sustainability club and our climate activism,"" Whinston said. ""Because in Summit County, I know a lot of people who are very sustainable, and I know a lot of people who think they're very sustainable. And there are always areas where we all can improve and become more aware, especially in a county like this where there's so much potential for sustainability and green climate action.""
Whinston said sustainability understandably has taken a back seat amid the pandemic, putting the group's protests on hold. But she said she hopes this protest reminds people that there are still ways to bring awareness to the climate crisis and be more sustainable even in a pandemic. Whinston said she believes it's important that visitors see climate demonstrations in Summit County so they can hopefully take some environmental knowledge or inspiration back home.
""Social justice is climate justice, and it's important that we use both to support each other because people of color are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis,"" Whinston said. ""And it's important that we acknowledge that and that we're educating and we're aware of the ways that we can be more equal, and one of the ways that we can be more equal is by pushing for a more sustainable system."" Ugne Kaselas, who gave a speech at the protest, said she is part of the sustainability club because she finds her culture in sustainability and environmental awareness. She said the group's visibility has increased through efforts like its auction for Australian Bushfire Relief and other climate protests, which have furthered its goal of bringing awareness to climate issues. Kaselas said she was inspired to participate in environmental activism when she saw forestland in her home country degraded.
""Our pride and joy was our massive woods and untouched lakes,"" Kaselas said. ""And by the time I was moving out of Lithuania, I saw the news, it was all over that we are selling our wood pulp, we are renting out our lands and we are drastically increasing ecotourism in forms of hunting to get our country out of debt. And I really thought our nature was more valuable than trying to keep up with the industry. I was 12 years old, and I couldn't say that in words, but I was pretty sad."" Colorado Mountain College professor Andy Schoeneman attended the protest and called the involvement of young people in climate activism as ""invaluable"" but said it's important for people of all ages to participate.
Schoeneman, who teaches environmental ethics and introduction to philosophy at the community college, said he tries to make his philosophy course relevant to the issues of today, including environmentalism. He said he is hopeful the Biden administration will take steps to address climate change with a focus on renewable energy. Members of the Summit Sustainability Club and Extinction Rebellion hold signs Monday, Dec. 14, calling attention to the negative effects of climate change."
Broomfield approves greenhouse gas reduction goals.txt,"Broomfield approves greenhouse gas reduction goals
Broomfield City Council unanimously approved greenhouse gas reduction goals presented by the Advisory Committee on Environmental Sustainability (ACES). It gave ACES the green light to create a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan, which may include policies and recommendations out of the 2020 greenhouse gas inventory currently being conducted by University Of Colorado Denver on emission source data from various sectors in Broomfield. It could also include recommendations from the audit from the Colorado Energy Performance Contracting program (EPC) regarding energy improvements for Broomfield facilities over time.
All projects and programs, and funding for them, would be subject to council approval. ACES will first prioritize projects and policies that are ""high impact and revenue neutral or revenue positive,"" according to the committee. More expensive projects will be considered in the medium or long term and all will be approved by council on a case-by-case basis.
At the Aug. 18 study session, council directed ACES to come back with more cost-driven analysis surrounding these goals. One thing brought up by Major Patrick Quinn was that the goals are ""aspirational,"" which is true, ACES Vice Chair Aaron Heun said. They are also bench-marked off those of state and neighboring communities, ACES Vice Chair Heun said, and are goals worth aspiring to. He also said it's incredibly difficult to forecast cost 30 years into the future. ""There are incredible unknown costs to not acting on climate change,"" he said. ""I think it's important we consider those as well.""
It outlines greenhouse gas reduction goals for the community by the following percentages and dates: The goals for the city and county: 2025 30% 2030 60% 2045 90% 2050 100%  According to the resolution presented by ACES, scientists say the United States, and Colorado, needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 to stop the trend of global warming and hinder the impacts already underway.
""The recommended goals are consistent with the State of Colorado's GHG Reduction Roadmap and were established through a rigorous, science-based process as feasible, attainable, and necessary to limit the amount of anthropogenic warming of the atmosphere,"" according to the resolution  Heun presented slides, one of which focused on the ""cost of business as usual,"" which was created with the help of other ACES members. When looking at the cost of wildfires, allocating per capita those costs to the City and County of Broomfield, it comes to nearly $1 million a year, he said. Flooding is more than $1 million a year and drought is $2.5 million.
""Those are enormous numbers that are borne by doing nothing about climate change,"" he said. There is an environmental justice aspect to this too, ACES member Catherine Drumheller said, citing air quality as an example of those impacts that are disproportionately borne by people in marginalized communities.
Ward 4 Councilwoman Laurie Anderson, who appreciated that the goals are aspirational, agreed this is something Broomfield needs to move forward on. ""This isn't out-of-control spending type of situation,"" she said. Mayor Pro Tem Guyleen Castriotta agreed the cost of business as usual is ""not one we can afford if we want a planet for our future generation."" She was in favor of putting skin in the game now, saying it is time for Broomfield to lead by example.
Broomfield is currently hiring a sustainability manager. 
Ward 4 Councilwoman Kimberly Groom, who approved of the plan, challenged ACES members to add more structure to the financial analysis component, including looking at them in terms of the number of years for return on investment or return on environment. While Groom said she's a huge environmentalist, she does not have a great belief in some ongoing activities, such as electric charging stations for vehicles. Broomfield has two stations at its Health and Human Services Building, 100 Spader Way. Groomed asked ACES to consider latest technology, citing a 30% electricity loss associated with stations right now.
Heun agreed there are efficiency loses, but gave the example of the Nissan Leaf which he said has a carbon footprint equivalent of a car that gets between 50 and 55 mph per gallon. In spite of that loss, they are still more carbon efficient than traditionally fueled vehicles, he said. ACES members are also looking at how those should be funded so that lower income residents are not burdened with charging other people's vehicles.
""Your concerns are our concerns and we're taking those to heart in our discussion,"" Heun said. Ward 2 Councilman Stan Jezierski backed the planning, saying climate change is real and ""we needed to act yesterday."" He feels this resolution provides a roadmap in the right direction and agreed with ACES members that the cost of not acting is huge. ""This is great,"" he said. ""Let's do it."""
Bull Mountain development plan finds new life.txt,"Bull Mountain development plan; finds new life

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will move forward with the Bull Mountain development plan roughly 15 miles northeast of Paonia. The project with its 146 federal wells and the 25-well dual operator 5-Pad proposal is not new but rather a continuation of a plan slowed down by ongoing litigation. Opposed by a number of conservation and environment groups in Colorado, the project was put on hold while an analysis was being conducted and subsequent activities and APDs approved in 2015 and 2017 were suspended.
In 2018 Citizens for a Healthy Community, High Country Conservation Advocates, the Center for Biological Diversity, WildEarth Guardians and the Wilderness Workshop filed a lawsuit challenging the BLM's decision on the two projects.
""As a result of the lawsuit, on Dec. 10, 2019, the court ordered the BLM to conduct further analysis of the reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts of oil and gas, and the suspension of approved applications for permits to drill (APDs) for the projects, and enjoined the agencies from approving further project APDs, until they had completed the supplemental analysis,"" said Natasha Leger, CHC executive director. She said BLM found that the two projects combined could result in the equivalent of up to 15.66 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions over 30 years. ""They recognize that climate change is a result of these aggregate projects but then they just decided to look at the local impacts and say that 'doesn't make a dent in global greenhouse gas emissions so, it's not significant so, move forward,'"" Leger said.
According to the BLM, there are no significant impacts that would keep the project from moving forward. Stephanie Connolly, manager of BLM's Colorado Southwest District, reported the project would only amount to ""a very small percentage (approximately 0.2%) of expected emissions from all oil and gas sources in Colorado for the same 30-year period.""
Leger disagrees. ""The North Fork Valley is in the middle of a climate hot spot, warming faster than the global average. This decision is more than disappointing in light of that. With this decision, the BLM is  basically saying it's okay to continue to contribute to climate change because the emissions from localprojects don't make a dent in global emissions.""
Leger said during the process the BLM did not ""substantively respond to their comments and essentially blew off the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment concerns regarding the conflict between the proposed action and Colorado's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" Western Slope Conservation Center, in Paonia, also commented on the latest development saying ""it is far from over.""
""WSCC continues to stand with the coalition of groups who previously filed a lawsuit on the matter, and we continue to believe that every community has the right to protect itself from negative impacts related to oil and gas development,"" said Tanya Henderson, executive director. Conservation groups are waiting to see what changes will take place with the new Biden administration. WSCC said they ""look forward to leaders who take climate change seriously and who work with us to adequately manage our local public lands as climate solutions and benefits to our diverse, rural economy."" 
Satisfied with the results of the supplemental analysis of the downstream climate-greenhouse gas emissions impact, the BLM will now allow drilling. When drilling will start likely depend on natural gas prices and getting well permits.

Burned_battered_and_buoyant_Stories_from_2020s__Eagle_Valley_Enterprise_CO___December_22_2020.txt,"Burne d, batte re d and buo yant: Sto rie s fro m 2020's - Eagle Valle y Ente rp rise (CO ) - De ce mbe r 22, 2020
Editor's note: Ready for 2020 to be over? Yeah, so are we -- but not before highlighting some of the bright spots in a year unlike any other. Instead of doing a typical look back at the news of 2020, we're focusing on the stories that showcased the indomitable spirit of our mountain community during a difficult time.
It wasn't until Dec. 18 that the U.S. Forest Service officially declared the Grizzly Creek Fire 100% contained.
The human-caused fire was ignited in the Interstate 70 median back on Aug. 10 and eventually burned 32,631 acres. Two Type 1 incident management teams -- Great Basin and Alaska -- were called in to battle the blaze along with numerous state and local firefighters. For more than a week, I-70 through Glenwood Canyon was closed to traffic which led motorists to make ill-advised decisions to attempt to navigate through the area via Cottonwood Pass or Crooked Creek Road.
On several evenings in mid August, a drive through the Two Rivers community in Dotsero found many residents sitting on front porches, warily watching flames that crept closer and closer. Evacuated residents of Sweetwater and the Colorado River Road waited helplessly for word about whether or not their homes remained standing.
Even though it hasn't been a direct fire threat for months, the aftermath of the Grizzly Creek blaze brings an increased danger of landslides in the narrow Glenwood Canyon corridor, as well as longterm financial, water quality and environmental impacts.
Fires blacken the landscape and the psyche, but as Harry Potter's philosophical headmaster Albus Dumbledore noted ""Happiness can still be found in the darkest of times, if we just remember to turn on the lights.""
For all the troubling stories that came out of the Grizzly Creek Fire , there were triumphant tales too -- neighbors helping neighbors, the community's outpouring of support for fighters, the first sprigs of greenery sprouting from the burn scars. As we close out this chapter of Eagle County history, here is a look back at some of those stories.
The Hanging Lake miracle
T hings didn't look good for one of the area's most popular hiking destinations when the Grizzly Creek burn area map was compiled Aug. 13. The popular Hanging Lake area was located squarely within the boundaries.
On Aug. 14, White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams and Marcia Gilles, deputy district ranger for the Eagle-Holy Cross Ranger District, were on board an operations flight that passed over the area. As the account in the Glenwood Post Independent noted, ""They were fully prepared for a sinking feeling, not knowing the fate of the iconic lake and surrounding features --
a visit to which could be described as a pilgrimage for some people, rather than a mere day-hike destination.""
""From the get-go, we were not able to do any fire suppression or mitigation or anything in Hanging Lake,"" Fitzwilliams said, describing those early days of the fire. ""There were too many other higher priorities -- people's homes, the freeway, power lines ... so we were just holding our breath.""
During the Aug. 14 flyover, Fitzwilliams and Giles said much of the fire area was hardly visible through the thick smoke.
""As we got closer to Hanging Lake, we both felt this anxiety, because we were afraid of what we were going to see,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""All of the sudden the smoke parted and we looked down, and that lake looked as tranquil as it always does."" High fives and fist bumps were flying inside the aircraft.
Ground crews on the Hanging Lake Trail also found reason to celebrate. Virtually none of the trail infrastructure was damaged, including all seven bridges, signs, the historic Civilian Conservation Corps shelter and the boardwalk along the south edge of the lake, Giles said in the Post Independent story.
""We keep calling it a miracle, that not a sin gle ember affected any of that,"" Giles said, describing scorched areas and active hot spots right next to some of the bridges and even under the boardwalk. ""The lake itself was just as gorgeous and blue as ever, the log, everything, was still intact.""
Unearthing a family treasure
The last thing that Ryan Halvorson, a task force leader working on the Grizzly Creek Fire, expected while working fire lines near Coffee Pot Spring was to discover a family heirloom that had been missing for 30 years.
Halvorson, of T enstrike, Minnesota, said he was out scouting line on the fire looking for hot spots when he came across a hunting knife ""in an island of green."" The name ""Jim Skoronsky"" was stamped on the knife's handle.
Halvorson figured the knife, given its condition, had been in the woods for maybe three to five years. But after Googling Skoronsky -- who now resides in Arizona -- and tracking him down on Facebook, leading to text messages and eventually a phone call, Halvorson found out its owner had lost it back in the 1980s.
Skoronsky reported that his father had fashioned the custom knife and that it was part of a matched set. He was shocked to learn his long-lostheirloom had been found.
""It was just a surreal moment,"" Skoronsky said. ""It was unbelievable. He sent me three pictures right from Coffee Pot Springs (sic) and I couldn't believe, after that many years laying there, and everything that goes on in Colorado, it was probably covered in 10 feet of snow for 30 years and
it's still in pretty good shape.""
Halvorson was able to meet up Skoronsky's daughter to return the knife to its rightful owner.
Fleeing fire with a whole menagerie
On Aug. 13, the Stephens family was eating dinner at their Sweetwater home, watching the Grizzly Creek Fire from their deck.
Then everything changed on a dime.
""We went from a nice, leisurely evening to 'You need to get out now,'"" Bill Stephens said.
The Stephens family has called the Sweetwater area home for four generations, and while they had discussed the possibility of a fire evacuation, it had never happened to the family. When the evacuation order came down they were faced with the same dilemma that all homeowners fleeing a fire face -- what vital items should we grab? But the family also had another challenge -- what to do with five horses, 20 chickens, three dogs and two cats?
""I had called the county extension office and asked if we could bring our animals to the fairgrounds. As a family, we decided that would be the best place,"" Mary Stephens said.
The response from Eagle County was a definite ""yes"" and the Stephens' animals weren't the only livestock evacuees at the site.
According to Denyse Schrenker from the Eagle County Colorado State University Extension Office, the fairgrounds hosted 58 horses and mules and 40 chickens during the Grizzly Creek Fire. There were 29 animal stalls occupied for a couple of weeks.
Schrenker said that when she heard about the Sweetwater evacuations around 6 p.m. Aug. 13, county emergency management specifically asked that the fairgrounds open to house livestock.
""I headed out to the fair-grounds at about 9 a.m. to get things ready to check-in animals and people started trickling in from then to about 3:30 a.m."" Schrenker said. More animals arrived the following day.
While the situation was obviously chaotic, Schrenker said the whole evacuation was surprisingly calm.
""Everyone came together and helped out their neighbors as a community. People were really pitching in together,"" Schrenker said.
The Stephens family agreed, thanking the firefighters, county staff, law enforcement, Colorado Department of Transportation workers and their many friends and neighbors who helped them weather a difficult time.
""I can't say enough about the people around here. You really find out how this community can
come together,"" said Bill Stephens.

Courtney Walsh kept a little Smokey Bear stuffed animal in her Boulder County home -- the teddy bear used to belong to her father when he was a child, and she always told her own kids it would keep wildfires away.
She forgot to grab the keepsake as she rushed through the house when the first evacuation order came through just before 2 p.m. Saturday. She ripped old photos and original family artwork off the walls, shaking as she corralled the kids and the rabbits and the dogs.
T hirty minutes after the first warning, at 2:25 p.m., sheriff's deputies roared into her driveway and urged the family to get out -- the CalWood fire was closing in. They loaded up the car and fled.
""We were just waiting and waiting, and you know there is T witter and live feeds,"" she said. ""Then we saw a picture from the National Weather Service, and it focused on our house burning. So then we knew.""
A friend who is a Hygiene firefighter later confirmed to the family that their home about 6 miles north of Boulder was destroyed, and sent pictures of the smoking ruins, charred bricks and twisted metal beams.
""There were baby books that I didn't grab, and I'm regretting it,"" Walsh said Sunday, fighting tears. ""Those are the one thing I always thought, 'I have to grab those if anything happens,' and I just didn't. I froze.""
The CalWood fire started Saturday and quickly grew to the largest wildfire in Boulder County's history, burning between Jamestown and Lyons. Nearly 3,000 residents were evacuated Saturday afternoon as the smoke plume billowed over the Front Range.
The fire stood at 8,788 acres Sunday, or about 13 square miles. Firefighters were working to build direct containment lines to stop the fire's spread, aided by calmer winds and more humid weather, Division Chief Mike Wagner with the Boulder County Sheriff's Office said at a midday briefing.
Wagner said Sunday night that 26 homes were lost in the wildfire, most of them on the eastern side of the fire, but noted the list was not complete.
However, when sheriff's officials later released a list of 27 impacted addresses, it showed that 20 homes were destroyed. Two more addresses were listed as ""damaged/intact"" and an additional two addresses were identified as vacant, undeveloped land. Additionally, two historic cabins and a barn on Boulder County's Heil Valley Ranch open space were destroyed.
No additional structures had been lost Sunday, Wagner said.
The perimeter of the fire did not grow much Sunday, and the fire was 15% contained by the
evening. About 250 firefighters were working the blaze.
Wagner said Sunday evening that night operations would be patrolling for flare-ups and hot spots. He said the northern ridge was the most concerning part of the fire because of rocky, steep terrain.
Wagner added the Rocky Mountain Type 2 incident team was taking over operations Monday morning .
Walsh said three of seven homes in her neighborhood were destroyed.
Evacuation centers remain open at both Boulder County's North Broadway Complex at 3460 N. Broadway and, for livestock, the Boulder County Fairgrounds at 9595 Nelson Road in Longmont.
Joe LaFollete, fairgrounds manager, said the grounds sheltered around 500 horses -- just more than the usual maximum capacity of 450 -- on Saturday night. By midday Sunday, the fairgrounds were sheltering 392 horses, 75 goats, 13 chickens, six sheep, five pigs, three llamas and donkey, he said.
The numbers have been declining as people find other places to house their evacuated animals or as they are able to return home, LaFollete said, adding the fairgrounds are still considering adding additional capacity in case more evacuations are ordered. A second Boulder County fire -- the Lefthand Canyon fire -- started Sunday near the 14000 block of Lefthand Canyon Drive and forced evacuations.
The Boulder County fires are two of several wildfires that either started in October or grew substantially this month in an unusual late-season outbreak.
""The 2020 fire season is looking unlike anything we've seen before,"" said Russ Schumacher, a climatologist at the Colorado Climate Center at Colorado State University. The uptick is driven in part by hot and dry weather, he said.
""Normally by this time of year we would have more periods of cooler temperatures and some more precipitation,"" he said.
More large wildfires have started this month than any other October in recent memory, he said. A warming climate , forest management and weather have all contributed to this year's fire activity. All of Colorado's top 10 largest wildfires have burned in the last 20 years, including two this year. The largest fire in state history, the now more than 203,000-acre Cameron Peak fire, continues to grow and is about 62% contained.
""As of the late 1980s, what was considered the largest fire on record was 15,000 acres, and now we've seen several fires just in this month get close to that,"" Schumacher said. ""And Cameron Peak is shattering the record, with much of that growth happening in October.""
Back in Boulder, Walsh and her family aren't sure what their next steps will be. Monday is her birthday, and they'd planned a staycation in town, so they already had hotel reservations when the
evacuation order came down.
Now, they're camped out in that hotel room, trying to figure out insurance and next steps. They tried to visit what was left of their house Sunday morning, but couldn't get through. Law enforcement told them it was still too dangerous, she said.
Walsh is grateful her family escaped unhurt, but is still gutted by their lost home.
""We're all safe, right? So, that's what matters,"" she said. ""That's what they say.""
Updated 11:30 a.m. Oct. 19, 2020 This story has been corrected to more accurately describe the loss of property in the CalWood fire . Boulder County sheriff's officials initially announced 26 homes had burned, but later released a list of addresses that showed 20 homes were destroyed. Two more addresses were listed as ""damaged/intact"" and an additional two addresses were identified as vacant, undeveloped land.

Between Boulder County's dual wildfires, more than 10,000 acres are burning after Tuesday's clearer skies, low humidity and winds led to increased fire danger.
And, officials said at a virtual community meeting Tuesday evening, the weather is forecast to get worse before it gets better.
Incident Meteorologist Derek Williams said at the meeting that today will bring critical weather conditions, expected from noon to 8 a.m. Thursday. A strong cold front will then move over the fire area, Williams said, dropping temperatures and raising relative humidity.
""Quite a weather change coming up,"" Williams said. ""As we move into Saturday and Sunday we have another strong system moving in, which will give us a good opportunity for accumulating snowfall ... with anywhere from two to five inches.""
The CalWood Fire that ignited and spread rapidly Saturday is at 9,854 acres and is 21% contained. The Lefthand Canyon Fire, which started Sunday, is at 459 acres and is 4% contained, officials said.
Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said no additional structures have been destroyed or damaged beyond the 25 announced Sunday night.
The point of origin for the CalWood fire has been narrowed to an area about a half-acre in size, while investigators have determined the point of origin for the Lefthand Canyon Fire , Pelle said. Officials did not specify the location of either point of origin.
The cause of both fires remains under investigation.
Officials believe the fires could be human-caused -- but do not suspect arson.
""There's absolutely no evidence to believe there's an arsonist setting fires,"" Pelle said Tuesday evening. ""We believe we may have some human-caused fires. We are making great progress on determining what happened. I expect to have some answers soon.""
Planning operations trainee Josh Shroyer said crews will ""feel great"" about the Lefthand Canyon fire in another day or two, given the progress made in keeping the blaze small.
Crews are monitoring winds Wednesday into the weekend, when forecasted snow could prove beneficial.
The community meeting also included a question and answer session, in which many residents asked about the status of evacuations in Lyons and Jamestown.
""Here's our concern with the town of Lyons. The difficulty is in this area,"" Pelle said, pointing to the northwest border of the CalWood fire on a map. He said there are steep, rocky cliffs with vegetation growing in the cracks there.
Pelle said the vegetation in those cracks has the potential to ignite following strong winds.
If officials chose to evacuate Lyons, residents would be notified via cell phone, a reverse 911 and from deputies canvassing the town.
""Personally, I don't think that's highly likely,"" Pelle said. ""Until this is cold and wet, we have to be careful, alert and on guard,"" he said, pointing to the same northwest portion.
Pelle said the status of Jamestown, which is under an evacuation warning, was made based on the topography of the town and the ability to evacuate through two paths.
One community member asked what containment lines are. Most of the time, the lines are manmade -- like digging a line through the ground to prevent the fire from eating more fuels, officials explained. Roads and rivers can also act as containment lines.
Residents also asked for clarification on Tuesday's announcement that USDA will close national forest land in Boulder County in response to extreme fire behavior.
""If your primary residence is amongst the national forest , and you are not in an evacuation zone, you will not be evicted,"" District Ranger Angie Gee said. ""And if your only access to your private property is a forest service road, we will work with you to give you an exception to get to your private residence.""

According to fire officials working on extinguishing the Cameron Peak Fire , the total acreage burned has reached 23,137 and the fire is currently six percent contained. The burning has increased by roughly 115 acres in the last two days and the containment has jumped from zero percent to six in the last week.
There will be a Virtual Community Meeting on Facebook today, September 3, at 7:30 p.m. Representatives from the Incident Management Team as well as cooperating agencies, including the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, will provide updates and answer any questions about the Cameron Peak Fire .
Officials with the Portland National Incident Management Organization (NIMO) and the Rocky Mountain Incident Management (RMIM) Team Black stated that the increase in the percent of the blaze contained is a direct result of better mapping of the western edge of the fire.
Fire behavior increased on Wednesday as fuels dried and winds increased. There are currently 883 personnel from over 30 states working to contain the fire that ignited on Aug. 13 and is currently burning 25 miles east of Walden and 15 miles southwest of Red Feather Lakes. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
Cameron Peak Fire
On Tuesday, crews continued monitoring and continued prep of structures within the fire area on Highway 14, Manhattan Road, Deadman Road, Laramie River Road, Pingree Park Road, Long Draw Road, and other areas surrounding the fire perimeter, a release said.
""As crews completed indirect line to protect surrounding communities, they have shifted to areas closer to the fire perimeter to begin construction on additional indirect lines. The surge group began building indirect line from Crown Point Road toward the Comanche Peak Wilderness. Crews also began construction on indirect line from Cameron Pass through the Neota Wilderness.""
On Wednesday, crews and heavy equipment continued to improve indirect lines established earlier in the week. Heavy equipment was used to construct line north of the Crown Point Road. Visible smoke columns rose from monitored hotspots on the fire perimeter as weather conditions aligned to rekindle fire activity. The fire was most active on the northeastern perimeter as the fire flanked along Green Ridge  crews were on site monitoring the fire and ensuring the safety of nearby structures.
""Crews monitored fire activity and patrolled Highway 14, Laramie River Road taking structure protection actions as needed. Structure groups assigned to the communities northeast of the fire continued to assess and formulate plans for additional resources should the fire begin to threaten the area. Crews completed about 40% of the line south of Deadman Road toward the Killpecker Tower,"" the Portland NIMO and RMIM Team Black release stated.
While last weekend's cooler temperatures and scattered showers slowed the spread of the burning, it is believed that this weekends' forecast will not be as helpful.
""As dry and warm conditions settle over the fire area through the weekend, fuels will dry, and fire activity is expected to increase,"" the release stated.
There was a Red Flag Warning is in effect on Thursday (Sept. 3) from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. The Red Flag Warning is the result of dry, warm, and windy conditions that will combine to increase fire activity. As fuels continue to dry, active fire behavior and increased smoke is expected. Officials say relative humidity will continue to drop into single digits by the weekend resulting in the continuation of critical fire weather.
The air quality in Estes Park is categorized as perfectly safe and healthy by the United States Forest Service Wildand Fire Air Quality Response team, with occasional smoke possible, especially overnight and into early morning hours.

Thanks to the snow that hit the Front Range over the weekend, both the Cameron Peak Fire and East Troublesome Fire didn't grow Monday and had little fire activity.
However, the snow also made it difficult for firefighters to get to the fire to fight it, according to an update from fire managers Monday evening.
Also Monday, the Red Cross released statistics for the number of people it has helped during the Cameron Peak Fire, East Troublesome Fire and Mullen Fire.
According to a statement, the agency is helping to house more than 2,600 people in over 1,600 rooms in 34 hotels, as well as people in two KOA campgrounds. Between these, nearly 28,000 overnight stays have been provided for wildfire refugees.
With other community partners, the Red Cross has also served more than 25,000 meals to those evacuated.
Cameron Peak Fire
The Cameron Peak Fire had another day of no growth, staying at 208,663 acres and 64% containment. The East Troublesome Fire T hompson Zone fire on the east side of Rocky Mountain National Park also had no growth Monday, despite activity over the weekend, staying at 4,346 acres and 0% containment.
Incident meteorologist Dan Byrd said Monday that while the fire area received a great deal of snow, warmer weather is expected to start melting the snow later in the week.
Glen Lewis, fire behavior analyst, said until the snow melts, fire is not expected to be very active.
""For now, and for an extended period here before it warms up, we really anticipate very little fire movement,"" Lewis said.
Operations section chief Joe Sean Kennedy said while the fire was tame because of the snow and cold weather and firefighters were able to hold fire lines, over the weekend the T hompson Zone did see some activity and pushed closer toward Estes Park. He said crews were able to work on defensive lines in the area to try to stop the fire from spreading any further.
Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said his teams are continuing work to get people into burn areas to let them winterize their property or see what damage their properties suffered. Sheriff's Office crews also able to downgrade some evacuation orders.
The Sheriff's Office downgraded the east side of County Road 27 from Masonville to the Stove
Prairie School from mandatory evacuation to voluntary Monday.
Smith said he has heard from some residents that they have been unable to get to their homes and learned about their damage or destruction from neighbors. Smith apologized for this and said he understands the frustration.
""We are all tired, we are frustrated, it is pushing 80 days here soon,"" Smith said. ""Folks have been very patient, but we understand your concern.""
Canyon Lakes district ranger Katie Donahue said during the evacuations and closures, rangers have seen people entering closed forest areas. She said people must check ahead of time for what areas are closed.
""It is super critical you guys look at that,"" Donahue said. ""We don't want anyone to get cited, and we really don't want anyone to get hurt.""
Fire team public information officer David Boyd passed along a statement from the town government of Estes Park that recreational visits to the town are prohibited.
Incident commander Dan Dallas introduced Rob Allen, incident commander for the Pacific Northwest Area Team 2, who will be taking over the fire management Tuesday morning.
East Troublesome Fire
Much like the Cameron Peak Fire, the East Troublesome Fire had no growth Monday because of the snow and cold. The fire has burned 192,560 acres and stands at 15% containment.
Incident commander Noel Livingston said the snow, while halting the fire , also halted the work of firefighters because crews were unable to access tougher areas.
""It was a day of rest for the firefighters, for the most part,"" Livingston said.
Brett Schroetlin, Grand County sheriff, said that while U.S. 34 into Grand Lake has reopened, people have been violating roadblocks to get into damaged areas to take pictures of houses and tell property owners who have lost structures before the Sheriff's Office is able to.
""These people are victims, they are in these neighborhoods, they deserve the right to have the contact and the appropriate notification process,"" Schroetlin said. ""This is hampering our process; it is slowing us down.""

The Cameron Peak fire exploded east toward Fort Collins on Wednesday, becoming the largest recorded blaze in Colorado history and prompting new evacuations as it sent a massive plume of smoke into the air over northern Colorado.
Officials say the fire, which has burned more than 164,000 acres, expanded into the area just west of Horsetooth Reservoir. Crews on Wednesday afternoon were scrambling to hold the fire back near the community of Masonville, warning of ""extreme"" behavior.
The fire, which is just 56% contained and has been burning since Aug. 13, has grown amid high winds and warmer temperatures. The fire was already the third largest in Colorado history before its explosive growth on Tuesday night through Wednesday evening, when it expanded by more than 20,000 acres.
""High winds throughout the night have created extreme fire conditions for firefighters,"" the fire's incident commanders said in a news release.
""This is a dynamic situation,"" incident commanders added.
In a community briefing Wednesday nightheld over Facebook Live, officials noted that Wednesday's spread could likely be the worst of the coming days, given changing weather and terrain conditions. However, incident commander Dan Dallas cautioned that the situation is still not stable and could change very quickly again.
""We're not through this wave of activity yet, and please bear with us,"" Dallas said.
Multiple evacuations were announced throughout the day on Wednesday, many of which began as voluntary but later switched to mandatory. New mandatory evacuation orders covered the areas of Bobcat Ridge Natural Area, Masonville, Horsetooth Mountain Road, and portions of County Road 52E.------------
Lory State Park is under mandatory evacuation orders as well. U.S. 34 has been shut down west of Loveland and Fort Collins because of the fire's growth.
Dozens of structures had already been consumed by the blaze before it grew on Tuesday and Wednesday.
""We do know that we lost structures today,"" Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said Wednesday night. ""It was a bad day. It very easily could have been a lot worse.""
Smith said that many of the day's evacuations, and their urgency, were not anticipated.
""This was really almost an epic day for doing evacuations,"" Smith said.
However, Smith said he's not worried about the fire expanding into Fort Collins or Loveland. This is in large part due to the terrain between the fire and the cities, as well as less heavy vegetation to help carry the fire.
The wildfire is believed to have been human caused. How it started remains under investigation.
OUR UNDERWRIT ERS SUPPORT JOURNALISM. BECOME ONE.
The Rocky Mountain Type 1 Incident Management Team took command of the fire early Wednesday morning, indicating officials' increasing concern about the fire's potential for growth.
Dallas, the incident commander, recalled the 2012 High Park fire. His team had been called in to manage that blaze, and later was summoned again for the 2013 floods. He noted in Wednesday's evening briefing that the High Park fire's burn scar, which has transitioned from dense forest to relatively open grassland, helped slow the Cameron Peak fire's progress.
Dramatic images of the fire's smoke plume over Fort Collins filled social media throughout the day on Wednesday. The column was visible from as far south as Broomfield.
The Cameron Peak fire is now far larger than the previous largest fire in Colorado's recorded history, the Pine Gulch fire, which torched about 139,000 acres near Grand Junction earlier this year.
The third largest wildfire in Colorado's history was the 2002 Hayman fire, which burned about 137,000 acres.
The state's 10 largest fires have all happened since 2000. Scientists say climate change is to blame for the ripe fire conditions this summer.To see an updated list of voluntary and mandatory evacuations, go to the Cameron Peak Fire Facebook page or the Larimer County Sheriff's Office website.

Strong winds along the Front Range Wednesday sent a huge smoke plume from the Cameron Peak fire over northern Colorado as flames continued to spread eastward, forcing new evacuation orders by the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, including Lory State Park.
The high winds also had firefighters on alert for flareups of the Wild Horse fire on Fort Carson along Colorado 115, now estimated at 670 acres and 40% contained.
Fire crews spent Tuesday tamping down hot spots inside the fire's perimeter and will remain alert for new ones that might arise, said Fort Carson spokesman Eric Parris.
Fort Carson crews used bucket drops from UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters to assist the firefighters on the ground Tuesday. The helicopter crews will remain on standby to assist as needed, Parris said.
Colorado 115 is expected to stay open, although Parris said commuters can expect to see smoke along the highway for the next couple of days.
When the fire erupted, the response drew more than 100 firefighters from Security, Colorado Springs, Cimarron Hills, Colorado Springs Utilities, the U.S. Forest Service, T ri-Lakes Monument Fire Protection District, Wescott, Palmer Lake and El Paso County Wildland were helping the Army fight the fire.
""All firefighting assets external to Fort Carson have been released,"" Parris said, adding there is no danger to people or structures on the base.
West of Fort Collins, the Cameron Peak fire has grown to 135,556 acres, the third largest in state history, since it started Aug. 13 in the Arapaho and Roosevelt national forests.
""The fire is very active right now,"" said Jered Kramer, a sheriff's office spokesman. ""We've had new mandatory evacuation orders, and several voluntary orders have been upgraded to mandatory.""
With containment at 56%, it is likely only a matter of time until the Cameron Peak fire becomes the second-largest or even the largest fire ever in Colorado.
The 2002 Hayman fire west of Colorado Springs burned about 137,700 acres, while the largest, this year's Pine Gulch north of Grand Junction, burned just more than 139,000 acres. Prolonged drought, coupled with a dry, hot and windy August has shown the effects climate change has had on wildfires in the West this year, with massive blazes also burning in California and Oregon.
The Cameron Peak fire's flareup brought new mandatory and voluntary evacuation orders for rural communities in the path of the flames.
Mandatory evacuations were ordered for for Glen Haven, Glen Haven Retreat, Storm Mountain and Palisade.
Evacuations for parts of Larimer County are in effect. Details on the evacuations can be found here.
Lory State Park is under voluntary evacuation orders from Cameron Peak fire officials, but Colorado Parks and Wildlife evacuated the park to protect visitors and staff. The fire is not burning on park grounds, but equipment and valuable property from the state park will be moved offsite.

The snow and much colder weather this week have stopped the growth of the Cameron Peak Fire, which stands at 102,596 acres Wednesday.
In both the northern and southern zones of the wildfire west of Fort Collins, fire activity was diminished by the wintry weather, according to the Cameron Peak Fire team's Wednesday morning update.
In the northern area, the fire was blanketed with 8 to 14 inches of wet, heavy snow, according to the update. This allowed crews on Tuesday to address the new fire perimeter to construct direct lines to contain the fire and hold it to its current footprint.
""The fire is not out, (but) it is also not in a place that it was a few days ago, so we do have some opportunity here,"" Jon T eutrine, operations section chief for the north zone of the fire said during Wednesday night's live update.
Also, the fire shifted Monday to more favorable terrain, moving into the burn scar area of the 2012 High Park Fire that contains less fuel.
""This snow is really going to put the hurt to that part of the fire,"" T eutrine said.
In the southern area, the snow allowed ""enhanced operational planning"" with members of the Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Valley Fire Protection District, Estes Park Police and Larimer County Sheriff's Office teams. During Wednesday's live update, Brad Johnson, operations section chief for the south zone of the fire said that they are preparing for the worst case scenario of the fire coming further south just in case.
""Hopefully that scenario never does comes up, but we are making sure the plan is in place,"" Johnson said.
As stated in the Tuesday night update by Planning Operations Section Chief Tom Barter, as other Colorado wildfires are being extinguished, more fire crews and equipment are arriving on site to assist with fire line construction, monitoring and mop-up operations.
More than 1,000 people now are fighting the fire, officials said.
With expected diminished fire activity Wednesday, crews continued to monitor the burn area and prepare for the construction of more direct lines to hold back the fire, according to the update. But officials expect the cold weather pattern to end, with a return to warmer, drier conditions later in the week.
There still are mandatory and voluntary evacuations in several parts of the affected areas,
including a voluntary evacuation for the areas of Glen Haven and Storm Mountain west of Loveland. All evacuation information can be found on the NoCo Alert website.
According to the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, damage assessment teams will begin structure assessment along Highway 14 on Thursday and in the Monument Gulch area in the days following, if they are able to access the areas. In a Facebook post Wednesday, the LCSO said that downed power lines, trees and other hazards are making it difficult and dangerous to access the area.
Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said that teams will be looking to evaluate in the Poudre Canyon area from Rustic and up, as well as the Monument Gulch Area, and will point people in the right direction for how to get assistance. Smith also said that while they do not have an exact number of lost structures, the number could be ""counted on one hand.""
Along with the live update Wednesday night, several individuals including Smith, U.S. Forest Service Canyon Lakes District Ranger Katie Donahue and Deputy Incident Commander Chuck Russell with the Portland National Incident Management Organization addressed community questions surrounding the fire.
When asked about their thoughts on the level of success in fighting the fire , Donahue said that it is hard to measure success with an event like this. She added that it is not black and white, and that the most important thing is no lives have been lost and no serious injuries have been recorded.
""The most critical value to us is people's lives,"" Donahue said.
Russell, who was present in Australia earlier this year to assist with wildfires happening there, said that while they were able to push that fire back, they did lose lives in that fight.
""That is not success, that is something that can never be replaced,"" Russell said.
He added that since no firefighters have died and, even when the fire exploded over Labor Day weekend, the firefighters were tough and did what they could to protect structures.
""That is what I call success,"" Russell said.

The largest fire in Colorado history grew another 5,000 acres reaching 164,140 acres on Thursday, according to the Forest Service's fire website.
The Cameron Peak fire, which has been burning in the Arapaho and Roosevelt national forests west of Fort Collins since Aug. 13, is the second fire this summer to reach historic proportions.
The Pine Gulch in the remote, high desert scrubland north of Grand Junction, became the state's largest wildfire ever when it grew to more than 139,000 acres in late August, surpassing the Hayman fire that burned 137,760 acres west of Colorado Springs in 2002.
Itheld that distinction for less than two months, though, before being surpassed this week by the Cameron Peak fire .
With containment at 56%, the Cameron Peak fire is likely to continue spreading unless colder and wetter weather tamps it down, fire officials have said.
Winds, while still gusting Thursday, were not as strong as Wednesday, allowing air attacks to resume, officials said.
The giant blazes this summer have been attributed to the effects of climate change -- prolonged drought and extreme heat -- that has worsened fire seasons throughout the West.
The main focus for the more than 1,000 firefighters on the blaze Thursday will be using sprinkler systems to soak areas around structures to ward off flames and embers.
Mandatory evacuation notices were issued for Lory State Park Wednesday afternoon and closures in Rocky Mountain National Park expanded Thursday as the fire spread near northern sections of the park. The closure includes Lawn Lake Trail. More details on evacuations can be found here.
A new blaze, the East Troublesome fire, broke out Wednesday in Grand County southeast of the Cameron Peak fire .
About 100 firefighters are attempting to contain the new blaze, which is around 400 acres, a spokeswoman said.
Strong winds up to 40 mph pushed the fire into steep terrain with thick beetle-kill vegetation. Structures in Big Horn Park are threatened forcing residents to evacuate Wednesday night.
In southern Colorado, the Wild Horse fire on Fort Carson along Colorado 115, is estimated at 670 acres and was 60% contained as of Thursday morning, said Fort Carson spokeswoman Brandy Gill.

Wind gusts as high as 76 mph fueled explosive growth of the Cameron Peak fire west of Fort Collins on Wednesday, helping push the 2-month-old wildfire across nearly 23,000 new acres and making it the largest in Colorado's recorded history.
The wildfire, which ignited Aug. 13 and survived more than a foot of early September snowfall, grew to 158,300 acres, or about 247 square miles, on Wednesday, firefighting officials reported in an evening briefing.
The fire remained 56% contained, sending towers of smoke billowing over Fort Collins and much of the northern Front Range throughout the day.
Wednesday's growth led to new mandatory evacuation orders in the Larimer County foothills, affecting mainly recreational properties -- including hundreds of mountain cabins -- in and around the communities of Glen Haven and Drake east of Rocky Mountain National Park.
""It was a bad day,"" Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said at the evening briefing, ""but it very easily could have been a lot worse.""
The fire's growth Wednesday pushed it from No. 3 on the list of Colorado's largest wildfires straight to No. 1, surging past 2002's Hayman fire , which burned 137,760 acres, and this summer's Pine Gulch fire , which scorched 139,007 acres on the Western Slope north of Grand Junction.
The giant wildfires across Colorado this season come amid a changing climate, with record temperatures, low relative humidity and statewide drought combining to fuel fire growth -- part of a 20-year cycle of aridity that's led to more expansive wildfires, including all 10 of the largest fires in the state's recorded history.
In the evening briefing, Smith acknowledged ""we lost structures today,"" but said officials don't yet have a count. No injuries or deaths were reported, he added.
The Cameron Peak fire previously had damaged or destroyed 95 buildings, including 33 homes, according to authorities.
Incident commander Dan Dallas warned residents to be prepared for the potential for more fire growth Thursday.
""T hings will calm down a little,"" he said, ""but we're expecting almost if not as much wind tomorrow and on into the next day. We're not through this wave of activity yet.""
Firefighters don't expect to see the wildfire push toward Estes Park to the south, or directly threaten Loveland and Fort Collins to the east. ""We really don't see anything to lead us to see a fire
that made it into the cities around here,"" Smith said.
On Wednesday, sustained winds above 50 mph drove the Cameron Peak fire east and south, with flames bursting through huge strands of lodgepole pine and massive amounts of beetle-kill pine trees.
""It's been relentless, driven by winds and burning through beetle kill,"" said Cass Cairns, a public information officer with the Cameron Peak firefighting efforts.
Overnight and for much of the day Wednesday the fire raced through a huge section of the Arapahoe and Roosevelt National Forest .
The rapidly spreading fire forced mandatory evacuations in the communities of Glen Haven, Glen Haven Retreat, Storm Mountain and Palisade Mountain, according to the Larimer County Sheriff's Office. Additional mandatory evacuations were ordered in the afternoon for the Bobcat Ridge Natural Area, Horsetooth Mountain Park, Overhill Drive, Milner Mountain, Lory State Park and Masonville.
""Evacuate the area immediately and as quickly as possible,"" the sheriff's office said. ""Do not delay leaving to gather belongings or make efforts to protect your home or business.""
Masonville is about 15 miles southwest of Fort Collins and other evacuated areas are also in the foothills west of city.
Smoke filled the skies around the fire for much of the day Wednesday, creating an orange glow at time and casting darkness at other times. In Fort Collins, brown particulate-laden smoke spilled into the city Wednesday morning as the fire spread, worrying residents.
""We had a huge wildfire in Brazil, too,"" said Colorado State University graduate student Renan Casagrande, 32, from So Paulo. ""Way bigger than here. We know temperatures are going higher. ... I don't know what we are going to do.""
Casagrande checked on horses at CSU's Mountain Campus campus in the late afternoon as winds shifted. ""It feels bad. Nobody likes to breathe smoke. This morning, it was terrifying. You smell the smoke, it is sad that everything is burning.""
Peak wind readings at weather stations in the fire area on Wednesday, according to Cairns, included:
* 76 mph at Comanche Reservoir with winds between 50 to 60 mph
* 73 mph at Deadman with sustained winds between 50 and 70 mph
* 62 mph at the CSU Mountain Campus with winds between 40 and 60 mph
* 54 mph at North Red Feather Lakes
The extremely strong and steady winds, overnight and into the day, kept firefighting aircraft on the ground for safety considerations, Cairns said. One plane with infrared sensing technology, used to map the massive fire, did take off.
Voluntary evacuations were posted Wednesday for the Redstone Canyon area, Otter Road (Buckskin Heights) and County Road 52E from County Road 27 east to include County Road 41 and Stratton Park, the sheriff's office said.
A new spot fire sparked south of Bellaire Lake, on the northeast side of the fire, and firefighters worked to keep it from jumping Manhattan Road, officials said.
On the southeast side of the fire, near the CSU Mountain Campus, the fire has pushed east about 5 to 10 miles, driven by strong winds. The fire crossed Pingree Park Road into the Buckhorn drainage heading towards Stove Prairie.
""Buckhorn road is a main area the fire has followed along,"" said Wayne Patterson, a fire information officer with the Cameron Peak firefighting effort. ""There's a lot of old lodgepole pine and a lot of old pine beetle kill in the area.""
Winds, tinderbox forest conditions and extremely dry weather combined to fuel the fire Wednesday.
""It's unusual that this is happening in October,"" Patterson said. ""We are usually not as dry as we are now.""
Relative humidity in the fire area has been in the teens or lower for about a two-week consecutive period, with a one-day break, and the extreme weather pattern is taking a toll.
""There are lots of big logs out there that will serve as a source for the fire for a long time yet, until we get an awful lot of moisture,"" Patterson said.
The extremely active fire is now also atop Signal Peak, northwest of Glen Haven.
On Wednesday, power was turned off, as a safety precaution, to customers of Estes Park Power and Communications ""from the top of the switchbacks through Glen Haven and down CR 43,"" according to Estes Park officials.
Strong winds and relative low humidity are back in the forecast on Thursday afternoon through Saturday. T emperatures will be close to seasonal norms on Friday with a gradual warmup through the weekend. A cool front is expected to arrive next week.

The largest fire in Colorado history grew another 8,000 acres, reaching 167,153 acres on Thursday, according to the Forest Service's fire website.

After nearly three weeks since being ignited, the Cameron Peak Fire has finally reached its first level of containment and did not grow overnight.
According to the Cameron Peak Fire team in their Tuesday morning update, workers have been able to contain 5% of the fire after a reconnaissance flight Monday found a section of the western boundary of the fire stopped in ""sparse fuels along a ridgeline."" The team added that fire managers are confident that this section of fire edge has been contained.
In Monday's update, Tom Barter, planning operations section chief, said that crews have begun to work on indirect lines much close to the fire. Teams in the north and northeast have pulled in closer as they finish lines they were working on farther out. Barter also said there is a fire crew along the southern tip of the fire working in much closer on tying lines together.
The Cameron Peak Fire Team also held a live question and answer session for community members to ask questions to the team.
Boyd Lebeda, a fire behavior analyst for the Rocky Mountain Incident Management team, said during the live video that while teams have seen better weather that has helped in fighting the fire, warmer weather will be a problem going forward into the week.
""Currently (the fire) is staying put, but we are returning to that pattern of very hot weather and we expect higher fire activity as we get towards the weekend,"" Lebeda said.
Many of those that tuned in were curious about specific road, area and recreational space reopenings. As of now, many of the area reopening dates have not been officially announced.
""We will make every effort that we can, said Justin Smith, a member of the Larimer County Sheriff's Office. ""Our goal is to help you get back to normal as much as we can.""
Katie Donahue, Canyon Lakes district ranger with the United States Forest Service, said she understands that it can be frustrating for individuals hoping to go camping, hunting or spend recreational time in the closure areas over the Labor Day weekend seeing closure areas so far from the fire's edge, but the design of the closure areas is done purposefully.
""Our primary goal is to keep everyone safe,"" Donahue said. ""It means keeping you, the public, safe and keeping the firefighters safe.""

CDOT_officials_brace_for_debris_danger_from_burn__Vail_Daily_CO___April_2_2021.txt,"CDO To fficials brace fo r de bris dange r fro m burn - Vail Daily (CO ) - Ap ril 2, 2021
In the aftermath of the Grizzly Creek Fire , U.S. Forest Service and Colorado Department of Transportation officials warned that more problems would materialize in the months ahead when spring thaw brought increased debris flow danger for Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon.
That time has arrived and crews are already at work to address the issue.
According to Elise Thatcher, CDOT Northwest Colorado communications manager, there are a variety of projects currently underway in Glenwood Canyon including rockfall mitigation and damage repair.
Thatcher said construction of new rockfall fencing, along with repair of existing fences, began immediately after the fire and continues this spring. Additionally, CDOT is at work on projects not related to rockfall concerns including replacement of damaged electrical conduits and repair of concrete coating on bridges. The concrete work does not involve structural repair, Thatcher said.
""It remains safe to drive in these areas. It's not a concern that the concrete is going to collapse,"" she noted.
Some of the larger rockfall mitigation project may result in what Thatcher calls ""brief"" highway closures beginning this month. Helicopter or crane crews may be called in, Thatcher explained, which will require CDOT to clear out traffic in the construction areas. However, she said, those closures would be for relatively short periods of time -- one to two hours. If closures are required, Thatcher said CDOT will alert the local residents and the traveling public about the plan.
Of course, there is still the potential for unplanned closures because of unstable soils left behind from the fire.
""We are expecting there will be some debris flow in the fire area,"" said David Boyd, White River National Forest public affairs officer. ""There is an increased change of rockfall and hazards.""
Rockfall closures of I-70 through the canyon happen periodically when boulders tumble down the steep canyon hillsides and onto I-70, especially during spring thaw or during big rainstorms. But after last year's 32,631-acre fire, there are new safety protocols for the roadway.
""People should know, and they should be aware of, potential for different types of closures this year,"" Thatcher said. Specifically, CDOT may decide to close the canyon bike path or rest areas if conditions warrant. CDOT reopened the Grizzly Creek and Shoshone rest areas this week and plans to reopen the bike path this spring, but those areas present evacuation challenges in the event of an emergency. For example, in many cases, people in those areas are separated from their vehicles and end up marooned after being evacuated.
""Evacuating rest areas and the bike path takes more time than closing the highway,"" Thatcher
continued. But evacuation of the path and rest areas can be done on in preemptive fashion, she added.
""We would anticipate closing those areas before a canyon closure and we are more likely to close the rest areas and bike path a day before anticipated weather,"" Thatcher said.
CDOT will closely monitor weather forecasts for the area, in anticipation of potentially hazardous conditions, Thatcher said.
Hot and fast
The Grizzly Creek Fire burned hot and fast, which is one of the reasons why it spread so quickly and closed I-70 for two weeks. But now, months after it erupted, the fire's nature actually has an upside.
According to Boyd, a USFS Burned Area Emergency Response team analysis of the Grizzly Creek burn scar concluded the fire didn't severely scorch soils.
""There will be a good opportunity for recovery. There are still roots and microrganisms in place,"" Boyd said.
Boyd said the USFS largely plans to allow natural regeneration of the area, but some remedial efforts have already started and that work will continue this year.
""We will have personnel up there monitoring and working in the burned areas as soon as they can get there,"" Boyd said.
Thatcher added that CDOT is also working on revegetation, laying down mulch and reseeding within the I-70 right of way through the canyon.
Lessons learned
""In an event like last summer, it is hard to say there is a silver lining. It was a very challenging situation,"" Thatcher said. But the Grizzly Creek Fire did give CDOT and other agencies and jurisdictions an opportunity to learn what happens when an emergency closes I-70 through the canyon for an extended period of time.
""Fortunately, this spring we have more time to prepare,"" Thatcher said. ""We are in the process of working with stakeholders to put the finishing touches on our safety closure protocol. We really want to make sure we have input and are on the same page with our stakeholders.""
The Grizzly Creek Fire vividly demonstrated that motorists will attempt to bypass the area via inadvisable routes including Cottonwood Pass and Crooked Creek Pass. In the event of an extended closure, CDOT will work with local jurisdictions to discourage motorists from attempting those detours.
Another problem that materialized with the Grizzly Creek Fire closure was the impact of backed up
traffic on communities located at the eastern and western sides of the canyon. ""We want to make sure we are immediately turning people around if there is closure so they aren't just sitting in Glenwood Springs for six hours, wondering what to do,"" Thatcher said.
She noted that of the biggest changes moving forward is the emergency detour for Glenwood Canyon I-70 traffic. The new route -- traveling east to west -- is north on Colorado Highway 9 at Silverthorne, west on U.S. Highway 40 to Craig and south on Colorado Highway 13 to Rifle to reconnect with I-70.
""Obviously, this is not a short detour. If there were shorter options that would be preferable, but there are not. These are the Rocky Mountains,"" Thatcher said. ""We will be strongly recommending the northern detour route this year.""
After CDOT finalizes its complete closure plan, Thatcher said the agency will reach out to local residents to share the details in community forums.
""We really want people to know what to expect and to be prepared,"" she said.

Chew on this Goats mow down fire danger in La Plata County.txt,"Chew on this: Goats mow down fire danger in La Plata County neighborhood - Herd eats through dense Gambel oak and ponderosa pine to create defensible space

A tribe of goats is making lunch out of Gambel oak stands in a subdivision northeast of Durango and helping the community reduce its wildfire risk along the way.
Edgemont Highlands, a 430-home subdivision, has put a concerted effort into wildfire mitigation projects since 2012. Normally, those projects include sawyer crews and contractors trimming back overly dense Gambel oak and ponderosa pine groves. This year, residents decided to try something new and brought in more than 100 Spanish goats to do the job. ""It just seemed like a great, environmentally sensitive idea,"" said Ron Duvall, chairman of the subdivision's fire mitigation committee.
Edgemont Highlands spans 500 acres, 200 of which are designated as open space. People are drawn to the area for its forested landscape, with dense stands of Gambel oak and ponderosa pines, stream drainages, meadows and steep slopes.
""As conditions change, we've become drier with less winter snowfall and less of a monsoon season,"" said Duvall, former U.S. Forest Service administrative officer. ""So we're drier and more fire-prone."" Populated areas in La Plata County have, on average, greater wildfire likelihood than 89% of other counties in Colorado, according to the U.S. Forest Service Wildfire Risk to Communities project. ""Wildfire likelihood"" is the annual probability of wildfire burning in a specific location.
Communities in the county have increasingly embraced wildfire risk mitigation after seeing large fires, such as the 416 Fire in 2018 and the Missionary Ridge Fire in 2002. The Edgemont Highlands Community Association put together a Community Wildfire Protection Plan in 2012 and has been trimming hazardous plant life ever since. ""People have been very supportive,"" Duvall said. ""When you have something like the 416 Fire burned in their memory  pun intended  they're very supportive of the efforts that the volunteer committee is doing.""
The goats, managed by Rx Grazing Services, began tackling 13 acres of Gambel oak and western snowberry bush near the Pioneer Trail in late May. Their job was to munch around a steep slope near Florida Road (County Road 240)  where a spark from something like a dragging vehicle chain or discarded cigarette butt could spark a blaze that runs up the steep slope. ""If it was flat land, we could use other tools that would be cost-effective,"" Duvall said. ""Since it's on a slope, the goats are really effective.""
Goats remove brush and leave larger, older oak stems. They help reduce ladder fuels, plants that can carry fire into the tree canopy, and the density of the plant life. But they bring more than just hungry bellies and agility for navigating the steep slopes, said Sarah Bangert, owner of Rx Grazing Services.
""The neat thing about using goats as a tool is, when managed correctly, livestock grazing can do some really important things for the soil through hoof impact and nutrient deposition,"" Bangert said. ""(They're) just kind of waking the soil up and drilling organic matter into the soil."" The herd will come back for three consecutive years to complete the job. Even with multiple visits, the goats are about 40% less expensive than a chainsaw crew, Duvall said. The grazing weakens the root system and can deter new growth; chainsaw treatment, on the other hand, can grow back vigorously within seven years. ""You still need the sawyers. If you have big oak underneath a pine tree, you have to cut that and remove it,"" Duvall said. ""The goats can't get up there, so you have to take those ladder fuels out with a chainsaw. You use them in conjunction with each other.""
While fire mitigation via goat might be novel in Southwest Colorado, it has been used in other areas, like California and northern Colorado, since the 1990s, Bangert said. Her herd, based in Lewis, has regularly tackled 100-acre spans for brush control and invasive plant removal since 2019.
""The need is endless,"" she said. ""You could run thousands of goats in this country and just start making a dent with what needs to be controlled, especially with the issues we have in our forests with the excessive fuel loading and drought."" Once the goats wrap up Sunday near the Pioneer Trail, Bangert will herd them through the neighborhood to a 3-acre project near Red Canyon Trail. Residents hope they will get an effective defensible space out of the project while setting an example for other communities.
""We're just excited to try this out,"" Duvall said.

On a recent Monday night in Morrison, U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse walked through a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp where, 80 years ago, impoverished young men from across the country came to escape dire unemployment and build Red Rocks Amphitheatre.
""It worked before and it can work again,"" the Democrat from Lafayette said of the New Deal-era program, which he and President Joe Biden would like to revive -- albeit on a smaller scale and focused on combating climate change.
Neguse's plan is to empower nonprofits and government agencies to build trails and fences, fight forest fires, remove invasive species and do an array of other work, primarily on public lands. In return, the organizations would receive federal money.
""Every forest could give me a list of projects in a few weeks and we would be busy for a very, very, very long time,"" said Ryan Banks, program director at the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps in Steamboat Springs.
The plan is to spend $10 billion expanding existing corps and send $14 billion more to those federal agencies that pay the corps for work, such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. Biden has signaled his support for Neguse's idea but the money will need to come from Congress, likely as part of a large infrastructure plan that is still in the works.
""This (effort) will create hundreds of additional jobs a year through conservation corps in Colorado,"" said Scott Segerstrom, executive director of the Colorado Youth Corps Association.
CCC, past and present
Red Rocks Park has one of the last intact CCC camps in the country. T hirteen of the original 14 buildings still stand. A small museum, open to the public by appointment, holds the original cots that CCC workers slept on and a stove they used for warmth.
""It was one of the largest of the New Deal programs and it was Roosevelt's favorite program but it was also the most popular federal program in history,"" said P. O'Connell Pearson, author of ""Fighting for the Forest : How FDR's Civilian Conservation Corps Helped Save America,"" a 2019 book.
T hree million young, impoverished men worked for the CCC over nine years from 1933 to 1942, serving for up to two years and earning $30 per month, $25 of which had to be sent home to their families. The camps bought their food locally, a boon to those struggling areas.
""Initially there were a lot of towns or rural areas that were hesitant to have camps nearby, because you're talking about 200 or so single young men moving in down the road from you,"" Pearson said. ""It sounds like a huge frat party and people were hesitant. But once it got going, people were
clamoring to get camps near them. They wanted them there.""
About 32,000 men were employed at Colorado's 172 camps. They built roads, trails and campgrounds; planted millions of trees; thinned crowded and dead brush from the forests; and fought fires. Their work remains at Red Rocks, Hanging Lake and throughout Colorado.
There are eight existing conservation corps in Colorado (five nonprofits and three run by counties) that enlist about 1,800 people and have a collective annual budget of $14 million. They employ AmeriCorps volunteers, military veterans and teenagers.
Some modern corps, such as the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps, involve camping, in which crews of eight to 10 people stay together for 10 weeks straight, working and playing away from home. Others, such as the Southwest Conservation Corps in Durango and Salida, prefer a program that lets young volunteers return home in the evenings and on weekends.
The Rocky Mountain Youth Corps has spent five years restoring and rerouting trails atop Mount Elbert, the highest point in the state. Their basecamp is at 11,000 feet and workers spend eight days on the mountain before six days off. All food must be carried up the mountain, Banks said.
""What we're seeing from our young people is that they don't necessarily just want to come and work on a trail crew for a summer,"" said Kevin Heiner, director of the Southwest Conservation Corps. ""They want to get more training in a specific career field that allows them that steppingstone from working with us ... to becoming a paid employee at one of the agencies we work with.""
In the past three years, 175 people ended up becoming fully certified wildland firefighters and 700 were certified to use chainsaws, a critical skill for lands work.
Congress' push
The White House announced in late March that its American Jobs Plan -- a $2 trillion infrastructure package -- would include $10 billion for a Civilian Climate Corps. That bill is still being negotiated and Neguse's bill hasn't budged since being introduced March 26.
Ohio Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur has proposed a similar idea since 2009, with little success. But smaller and more bipartisan help for corps has been signed into law; in 2019, Congress made it easier for federal agencies to work with existing conservation corps and was backed by the late Republican Sen. John McCain.
Corps supporters say they represent the best of government: public-private partnerships that don't grow government but instead employ young people seeking careers in firefighting and on public lands. In Colorado's forests and on its mountains, the unmet need is high, they say.
""Operating budgets for our partners are dwindling,"" Banks said. ""There is an influx of funding when there's a big fire ... but when it comes to basic maintenance and base-level funding, our partners are strapped across the board.""
As he toured the former CCC camp at Red Rocks, Neguse came across a framed copy of the congressional legislation that created the CCC in 1933. In it, he sees a confluence of history and modernity.
""The CCC is something that has captured the imagination of the American public,"" the congressman told reporters after the tour. ""... It's really helpful for me to be able to tell stories of the CCC of the 1930s and make the case that it worked before and it can work again.""

Climate Action Collaborative A song of ice and fire.txt,"Climate Action Collaborative: A song of ice and fire

The Royal Elk Glade at Beaver Creek is one of my favorite tree runs of all time. With no shortage of steep terrain and a magical run out to give your legs a break, it is pure bliss on a powder day. Watching weather forecasts carefully, there were a few times throughout the 2020/2021 season that I braved Vail Pass during a storm hoping there'd be enough snow for patrol to open the glade. To my dismay, even into March, it was roped off every time due to ""lack of coverage."" I'm not sure if they ever pulled the ropes or not  perhaps I unluckily missed an opening period  but what I do know is that in my years of skiing Beaver Creek, I've never seen it closed so late into the season.
My longing for the Royal Elk Glade serves as a melancholy reminder that Colorado's snowpack is changing. We know the West cycles through drought periods but this is increasingly beyond normalcy. In February, our water year precipitation was around 84% of average. This April, that number dropped to 75%. Both numbers indicate that we didn't get the sustained, healthy snowpack we need to stave off drought in the upcoming summer months.
When 80% of our water supply comes from our snowpack, these are concerning deficits that are illustrating the effects of climate change in our community. Alarmingly, mountain surface air temperatures are warming at a faster rate than the global average surface air temperature. What follows is less water storage in our snowpacks, which lead to reduced river flows in the warm seasons. Overall, we have a reduced water supply for water-based recreation, agriculture, and potable water. These temperature changes and water reductions also cause changing wildflower seasons and worsened pine beetle infestations, with varying repercussions inflicted upon our ecosystems. There's an added danger to water scarcity that Eagle County residents know all too well. A dried-out landscape full of dried out trees and underbrush is extremely susceptible to wildfires, and these wildfires are burning with more fury and frequency.
I know this all sounds pretty scary, and frankly, it is. But this is the time to turn concern into beneficial initiative. it's time to consider the impact of our day-to-day emissions, to be smart with our water choices, and to rally around sustaining the beautiful place we live in. Luckily, we have more than one handbook that can help Eagle County become resilient in a changing climate. First, the Climate Action Collaborative recently released an updated Climate Action Plan that outlines priority actions for the buildings, waste, energy supply and transportation sector emissions reductions.
Additionally, it includes mechanisms to enhance our efforts for education and outreach, carbon sequestration, water conservation, and community resiliency. These CAP strategies will help us tackle our greenhouse gas emissions; an important first step to mitigating drought and wildfire. Second, there is the Eagle County Community Resilience Plan, developed by community experts, county partners, and county staff  and highlighted in the CAP. Water resilience strategies focus on improving our water quality and quantity. Since we can't directly control the amount of water available to us from Mother Nature, this strategy involves being mindful of how our current practices and our growing developments affect resource use. Becoming more efficient with both indoor and outdoor water use can help sustain this precious resource supply as our population continues to grow.
Lastly, The Resilience Plan and the Colorado Forest Management Plan tie wildfire strategies into resilience. While wildfires are essential to ecosystem growth cycles, exacerbated wildfires are destructive. Therefore, these plans outline ways to build up front-line communities; improve civic engagement, trust, and equity; fund and implement wildlife habitat restoration projects; and ensure health, safety, and well-being of our community residents and visitors during and after a disaster. It's important to remember that we, as members of Eagle County and beings who share a lifeblood resource with entire ecosystems, are key to successful implementation of these resilience plans. The weight does not fall solely on decision makers' shoulders, but on the community as well. This summer, talk with your families or roommates about how your household can become more water and energy efficient. Do some research to see how you can support frontline communities during a disaster, if you are able. Talk with your local landscaper about incorporating native and drought-tolerant plant life at your house or business.
We are lucky to live in some of the most stunning landscapes in the world. Let's rally together and do what it takes to protect our homes, our livelihoods, and each other. To learn more, please visit the following websites: Climate Action Collaborative, Eagle River Watershed Council, Eagle County Community Resilience Plan. Claire Kantor is a Climate Action Collaborative Fellow at Walking Mountains Science Center in Avon. The Climate Action Collaborative is working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Eagle County 25 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050.

Climate change politics shifting  More candidates are accept.txt,"Climate change politics shifting - More candidates are accepting its
existence, but embracing it could be costly in oil and gas areas

Despite increasing acceptance of the science of climate change across the state, what to do about it remains a politically sensitive question. Colorado, as in the world in general, is getting hotter, drier and increasingly susceptible to floods and wildfires, and humans are influencing this climate change by burning fossil fuels, raising livestock and cutting down forests. Among many data points, Coloradans can now look to the fact that prior to this year the state had never seen a wildfire larger than 139,000 acres, and since July alone it's had three fires at least that big, two of which are still burning.
Although there is scientific consensus about the existential threat climate change poses, and significant incentive for Coloradans of all backgrounds and political stripes to pay attention to it, politicians here have not always found addressing climate change to be a winning issue. That's changing now, too.
""Even two years ago, I think there was still some hesitancy,"" said Karl Hanlon, Democratic candidate for Senate District 8 in western Colorado, who has worked on climate and water issues for two decades.  ""Especially in the right-leaning community, there was hesitancy to acknowledge that climate change was there and it was impactful. Well, it's right square in front of everybody now.""
The Pew Research Center found that in 2020, for the first time in a series of polls dating back to 2002, nearly as many Americans (64%) said environmental issues were a top policy priority as those who said  the same of economic issues (67%). Pew also found a 14% jump in just three years in people who believe addressing climate change specifically is a top issue.
This trend has been observed in Colorado as well. A 2020 study out of Colorado College found 63% of Coloradans ""think that action should be taken to address climate change"" -- up 8% since 2011. That's encouraging, said Liliana Flanigan, a climate activist who recently graduated from Palisade High School. She grew up in a deep-red area with lots of jobs centered on oil and gas extraction, but she said she's starting to see more of her neighbors recognize that climate change profoundly threatens the agricultural and public lands that also characterize the region.
""People here are less plugged in to the idea of cities, of pollution,"" she said. ""But we were hit hard by the Pine Gulch fire. Temperatures are rising; we're setting record highs.""
The terms of debate on climate action in Colorado politics clearly have shifted, to the point that outright denial of human-caused climate change is no longer a popular position among Republicans. Take U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, for example: 2017 comments from the Yuma Republican showed him hedging when pressed about the causes of climate change, but at a recent debate with his opponent, Democrat John Hickenlooper, he said clearly thathe accepts the scientific consensus on what's causing the trend. But there remains a gulf between Democrats and Republicans, and even within the Democratic Party, over how urgently this global problem should be addressed, and what steps should be taken. Even as he says he accepts one scientific fact, Gardner also slams Hickenlooper -- a former oil and gas geologist who opposes the Green New Deal -- for voicing the idea that addressing the climate crisis means making fracking obsolete in the coming decades. Gardner's position is, more or less, the party line in Colorado. It's a central theme in the campaign of Republican congressional candidate Lauren Boebert, who's running to serve southern and western Colorado.
""Yes, I want to make sure our Earth is healthy. But I think that squashing the natural gas industry is the exact wrong way to do that,"" said Chelsie Miera, executive director of the West Slope Colorado Oil & Gas Association, at a recent meet-and-greet for Boebert. ""When you regulate an entire industry out of existence, that's where I do have a lot of disagreements,""
Miera said.
Flanigan said Democrats who set policy in Colorado must do more to meet people with Miera's viewpoint where they're at.
""The messaging needs to be very different, for the people outhere to understand, 'Oh, the work that I do is contributing intensely to climate change,' "" she said. ""It's difficult to provide a policy solution to, say, somebody whose family has worked three generations in an oil field, to say, 'Here's a transitional program.' That's what a lot of rural Republicans are trying to avoid.""
Hanlon, in the home stretch of his race challenging GOP state Sen. Bob Rankin, said he's trying to thread that needle on the trail. He remembers when his family ranch in Jackson County rarely saw a day above 80 degrees and says now, ""it feels like half the summer it's above 90."" He says voters he meets share similar stories, that they see the impacts every day of dry streams and hotter summers, and that increasingly they feel it viscerally.
And so he has made climate action a central part of his platform. Climate change is the very first item on the ""issues"" page of his website, in contrast to Rankin, who is an outspoken advocate for oil and gas jobs, and whose website does not mention climate change.
But Hanlon also has found it a challenge to communicate on the issue without alienating those who, like Miera or Gardner, are most concerned with preserving jobs in extractive industries. ""Frankly, talking about climate could cost me this election,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, in northwest Colorado the climate conversation has been distilled down to, do you support coal and natural gas and the people who work in those industries, or this idea that it's an urban climate leftist agenda. That is still being used as a wedge issue outhere.""

Climate expert to Vail Valley leaders Nowhere close to the n.txt,"Climate expert to Vail Valley leaders: 'Nowhere close to the new normal'

EDWARDS  The only rational response to the greatest threat to mankind is a radical one. That was the message delivered Wednesday night by Dr. Robert Davies, a renowned physicist and climate science expert, to a packed auditorium of more than 400 attendees at Battle Mountain High School. Davies' lecture, ""Getting to Zero: From Radical to Rational,"" was hosted by the Climate Action Collaborative and attended by elected officials from Vail, Avon and Eagle County as well as local Vail Resorts mountain executives and other community leaders.
""The bad news is that we're not even close to meeting these challenges,"" Davies said during a sobering hour-plus monologue. ""The good news is that we haven't even tried. We're going to have to figure it out."" 'This isn't alarmist'
What will the Vail Valley and the world look like at the turn of the next century? It's a terrifying sight if we, as humans, continue on our current pace of carbon dioxide emissions, Davies said. Picture local winters with no snow, just rain. Imagine hotter temperatures, food and water shortages. Picture 2 meters of sea-level rise globally, complete extinction of coral reefs and as many as 200 million humans displaced from coastlines and 600 million more annually flooded. Envision global political chaos. ""This is why the U.S. defense department views global climate change as the single largest security threat our nation faces,"" Davies said.
The only words to describe such conditions are catastrophic, un-adaptable and irreversible. It's enough to make anyone despair, but Davies plainly stated that climate scientists around the globe aren't projecting doomsday scenarios to make headlines.
""We're nowhere close to the new normal,"" he said. ""This isn't politics, this is just physics. This isn't alarmist. The information is alarming  Humans are very adaptable, but we're very finely tuned to the climate we have and where we get our food and water, how we move around  Once we cross thresholds and tipping points, the planet will be a dramatically different place, and once you cross, the likelihood that you can return to the place in which human civilization is very highly tuned is essentially zero. The chances of going back become dramatically reduced."" He added: ""When you don't know where the edge is, you want to stop before you get there if the consequences are big."" A cultural problem
For more than a decade, Davies has been recognized in critical science outlets for his work on global climate change and sustainable human systems, and he has delivered hundreds of public lectures during that time.
While his talk Wednesday was heavy on climate science, and the overwhelming scientific consensus about the increasingly alarming effects of global climate change, he sprinkled in asides on history to put into context the response required to save the planet.
More than anything, Davies said global climate change is a cultural and political problem to solve  and that there's a role for every single human to play. There's also no time to wait. ""We've got to find a mindset where we can move forward in response to the problem,"" he said. ""Our job is to take the next step with the mindset of an emergency. In an emergency you don't hope you get out, you just get out  We have no time to fix climate change. The next decade is the most important any of us will ever live through.""
To use a very simple metaphor, he likened climate scientists to the engineer on board the Titanic who knew the ship was doomed when he saw that five compartments had flooded while the rest of the crew thought that the iceberg had only delivered a glancing blow. ""Yes, it's extremist, but it needs to be,"" he said. ""We're clearly nowhere near the response it requires,
according to the physics.""
Viable solutions To solve the problem, Davies said the framing of the problem has to be a mindset of resolve on a global scale.""You resolve to do something and then you figure out how to do it,"" he said. He then provided historical precedents for meeting such a challenge. He spoke of the Apollo 13 engineers who figured out a way to get the astronauts back safely to Earth against impossible odds, or Winston Churchill rallying Great Britain when surrender and Nazi occupation was all but assured during World War II.
Among other things, he said nobody would think that U.S. automakers shutting down the production of new cars would be a viable solution, nor would grounding all domestic flights. And yet, the United States has done both things before. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Congress banned the production of new autos and pushed automakers to make tanks for the war effort in the fall of 1941 and we grounded all flights in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ""What is radical is knowing and not responding,"" he said. ""It's got to take us out of our comfort zone, plugging ourselves into efforts that change whole systems.""

What will our mountain communities look like in 50 years? How do we imagine and create a sustainable future? Mountains are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than many other regions and the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to diversify our tourism-dependent mountain resort economies while creating equity and economic resilience for all.
Amidst the complexity and crises we find ourselves in, we must create spaces in our lives for longterm thinking and ingenuity. The past successes of our mountain resort communities demonstrate we are pioneering and innovative, they demonstrate we can do this.
A 2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report sheds light on the global forces impacting high mountain areas we must grapple with as we make our way forward. Winter mountain snow cover is shrinking up to 10 days per decade. Changes in the seasonality of snow runoff are impacting our rivers and cold-water fish. Species of plants and animals are changing as new warmer habitats open up and colder refugia are reduced.
Tourism and recreation have already been negatively affected by declining snow cover and its impacts on summer recreation. These trends will intensify and continue throughout the century. Integrated cross-sector management and effective governance are needed to reduce vulnerability to these impacts. Fortunately, the Eagle County community has established action-oriented framework to pave a path forward.
The Climate Action Collaborative and the Eagle County Community Resilience Plan call for local strategies to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions while creating more sustainable and resilient economic development. Our sustainable mountain tourism sector depends on a healthy vibrant community of year-round residents with meaningful well-paying jobs.
According to the Colorado Department of Local Affairs, tourism currently accounts for 60% of Eagle County's economy. Economists warn no sector should account for more than 30% of the economy. Herein lies a nexus of crisis and opportunity to invigorate new economies and fill the economic gap. The COVID-19 pandemic provides the space for us to rethink and imagine the future of our mountain home.
Let's use some of this collaborative trust and momentum to use our valley's collective imagination to focus on a long-term sustainable vision. There are opportunities emerging for innovation and entrepreneurism to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and generate mountain economic development that protects and enhances the natural open spaces that sustain us.
The first opportunity is sustainable food and agriculture. Momentum is underway with the Knapp Ranch and Hoop House. More valley-wide resources that provide year-round employment are needed alongside continued protection and cultivation of the valley's agricultural lands and soils. Jackson Hole's Vertical Harvest greenhouse is an example we can follow.
The second opportunity is transportation and mobility. The 2017 Eagle County Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report illustrates that vehicles are the greatest source of local GHG emissions. Our communities must be re-envisioned to include priority infrastructure for pedestrians, bicycles, electric vehicles, and public transportation. A variety of creative sustainable mobility industries and their associated jobs can be generated to serve, assist and enrich people while moving up and down the Eagle Valley.
The third opportunity is housing. Sustainable, affordable, net zero community housing built in previously developed areas close to town centers, transportation hubs, and jobs. New housing must be built hand-in-hand with emerging sustainable food, transportation, jobs, and access to open spaces, and must be built for year-round residents.
Fourth, protection and restoration of open spaces, forests, rivers, and wildlife habitat. This ongoing opportunity, which can be overlooked from the perspective of traditional economic development provides physical, emotional, and spiritual benefits of being outdoors in the mountains and are key to the behavioral health of our community. Climate warming increases the risk and frequency of wildland fires and forest insect outbreaks. Innovative partnerships with U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, local governments, and private landowners can improve the health of mountain habitats while supporting human and ecological health.
Finally, imagination and creativity must be cultivated through education, arts and training. Call this the creative learning economy. Educational opportunities thathelp us see one another, and our world, in new ways; and that cultivate interdisciplinary long-term thinking, and prepare people to lead and in these emergent sustainable economies are critical. Enticing career pathways must be accessible to all and tailored to meet the needs of our diverse community.
There are people who need immediate support to sustain themselves and their families, as there are severe inequities and injustices in our society and we must tackle these immediate threats while aiming to address underlying issues. At the same time, for those who are facing new windows of time and space, the time has never been better to seize opportunities, think long-term, and strengthen the creative capacities for a sustainable mountain community.

The Sept. 30 issue of DCI included a letter to the editor blaming environmentalists for the unprecedented forest fires that scorched over 4 million acres, destroyed several small towns, and killed nearly three dozen people. The letter blamed environmentalists for shutting down logging and letting fuel loads accumulate. These accusations echo President T rump's, who blamed the fires on Western state governors who needed to manage their forests more effectively.
While forest management played a role in some of the conflagrations engulfing the west, this narrative ignores the fact that much of the fuel load is due to a prolonged drought that killed almost 150 million trees in California alone, and that these lands are tinder-dry due to a current drought and months of record-breaking temperatures. This past August was the hottest ever recorded in California. Over Labor Day weekend, cities up and down the state shattered temperature records - 121 degrees in LA, 105 degrees in Santa Cruz, 112 degrees in Redding - the list goes on. No amount of forest management can mitigate these extreme conditions.
Unprecedented drought and high temperatures, brought about by climate change, are the driving force behind these fires . Washington Governor Jay Inslee referred to climate change as ""a blow torch over our states in the West."" In April, Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, published a study in the prestigious journal Science concluding that climate change has ""pushed what would normally have been a moderate drought in southwest North America into megadrought territory,"" on par with the worst droughts in the last 1200 years -- droughts that forced earlier civilizations off their land. In a recent interview, he said ""No matter how hard we try, fires are going to keep getting bigger, and the reason is clear  Climate is really running the show.""

FORT COLLINS, Colo. (KDVR) -- The explosive growth of the East Troublesome Fire is more evidence of climate change according to state climatologist Russ Schumacher.
""To see huge fires like this in late October is far beyond anything we've ever observed in Colorado before,"" said Schumacher, who serves as the director of the Colorado Climate Center at Colorado State University.
While it might be easy to blame dry and dead trees on pine beetles, Schumacher notes the beetles have flourished because mild winters have prevented them from being killed off.
On top of that, Colorado is in a severe drought.
""The weather station at Grand Lake is from July 1 to now the driest on record for that period of time by quite a bit. They've had less than an inch of rain over that time period. Normally you'd see about 7 inches,"" said Schumacher.
""We're in unprecedented situations right now,"" said Camille Stevens-Rumann, a fire ecologist with Colorado State University.
Stevens-Rumann was once a Hot Shot firefighter who fought wildfires in New Mexico.
Now she studies how fires impact forest ecology.
""We may have had earlier snow events by this point. We also probably wouldn't have had the length of time that we had all summer to let those fuels dry out,"" said Stevens-Rumann.
In addition, she said wildfires and a changing climate make area burn scares less conducive to reg rowth.
That's concerning because trees capture carbon in the air which helps slow climate change.
""Growing evidence that these forests are going to have a harder time recovering,"" said StevensRumann. ""We definitely are not going to see the same carbon storage capacity that those forests had last year for a long time to come.""
It's a dangerous circle according to Stevens-Rumann because less trees mean more carbon dioxide in the air which accelerates climate change which helps fuel wildfires.
""This year is rewriting the record books again because we've seen now three of our four biggest fires in state history this year,"" said Schumacher.
After talking to Schumacher, the East Troublesome Fire continued to grow, meaning all three of
Colorado's biggest wildfires in state history are burning at the same time.
The Cameron Peak Fire ranks first, at a size of nearly 207,000 acres burned so far. As of about 5 p.m. on Thursday, the East Troublesome Fire is second at more than 170,000 acres. The Pine Gulch Fire north of Grand Junction is now the third largest at 139,000 acres.
The Hayman Fire burned 137,760 acres in 2002 and before this year, was the largest is Colorado history.

By Philip Higuera, The University of Montana; Bryan Shuman, University of Wyoming, and Kyra Wolf, The University of Montana
The exceptional drought in the U.S. West has people across the region on edge after the recordsetting fires of 2020. Last year, Colorado alone saw its three largest fires in recorded state history, one burning late in October and crossing the barren Continental Divide well above treeline.
Those fires didn't just feel extreme. Evidence now shows the 2020 fire season pushed these ecosystems to levels of burning unprecedented for at least 2,000 years.
That evidence, which we describe in a study published June 14 serves as a sobering example of how climate change is altering the ecosystems on which lives and economies depend. A previous study nearly a decade ago warned that by the mid-21st century, climate warming could increase burning past historical levels and transform some Rocky Mountain forests. Our results show such changes in fire activity are now underway.
Uncharted territory
As paleoecologists  scientists who study how and why ecosystems changed in the past  we've spent decades researching how wildfires, climate and forests change over time.
We used to be able to look to the past when rare events like large wildfires occurred and say ""we've seen this before and our ecosystems have generally bounced back."" In the last few years, however, it's become increasingly clear that many ecosystems are entering uncharted territory.
Witnessing the exceptionally large fires burning in high-elevation forests in 2020, unusually late in the season, we wondered if we were experiencing something truly unprecedented.
In Colorado and Wyoming, the largest fires of 2020 were burning in a region where our research teams have spent more than 15 years developing records of fire history and ecosystem change from materials preserved in the bottom of lakes. This work has centered on understanding how climate change might one day affect wildfires. We looked to those records for an answer.
Evidence of past fires preserved in lake sediments
When a fire burns a forest , it sends tiny bits of charcoal into the air. If a lake is nearby, some of that charcoal will settle to the bottom, adding to the layers that build up each year. By plunging a long tube into the mud and extracting a core, we can examine the history of the surrounding landscape  revealed in the layers of everything that sank to the bottom over thousands of years.
Carbon dating of tree needles and twigs helps us determine the age of each layer in a core. Pollen preserved in the sediments can tell us what grew nearby. And dense charcoal layers tell us when
fires burned.
We used such records of past fires preserved in the sediments of 20 lakes in the central Rocky Mountains. In total, the dozens of researchers who helped analyze these cores counted over 100,000 tiny charcoal pieces, within the thousands of 0.5-centimeter layers of lake sediments examined. Identifying distinct increases in charcoal accumulation within the cores allows us to estimate when fires burned around a lake, and compare today's patterns to those of the distant past.
The result: The extensive burning over the 21st century is unprecedented in this region in the past 2,000 years.
Burning nearly twice as often
We estimated that fires burned the forests around each lake once every 230 years, on average, over the past 2,000 years. Over just the 21st century, the rate of burning has nearly doubled, with a fire now expected to burn a given spot once every 117 years.
Even more surprising, fires in the 21st century are now burning 22% more often than the highest rate of burning reached in the previous 2,000 years.
That previous record was established around 1,100 years ago, during what's known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly. The Northern Hemisphere at that time was 0.5-degree Fahrenheit warmer then than the 20th century average.
Subalpine forests in the central Rockies during the early Medieval Climate Anomaly burned on average once every 150 years. To put that period's temperature into perspective, the Northern Hemisphere in 2020 was 2.3 degrees above the 20th century average.
In an earlier study based on a subset of the same records, the Medieval Climate Anomaly stood out as a harbinger of what could happen as Rocky Mountain forests warmed. Research in the boreal forest of central Alaska has also documented unprecedented burning in recent decades.
Climate change, with accomplices
Research clearly links recent increases in fire activity across the West to increasingly warm, dry summers and human-caused climate change. Our evidence shows that the rate of burning over the past 2,000 years also tracked smaller variations in the climate in the central Rockies.
Warmer, drier conditions make vegetation more flammable, loading the dice for the possibility of large fires. Human activities, a history of suppressing most fires and insect-killed trees all affect when, where and how fires burn. These influences vary across the West and each is layered on top of the warmer, drier conditions of the 21st century.
Adapting to a future unlike the past will be a significant challenge for land managers, policy makers and communities. Reducing the threats of increasing wildfires requires both combating climate change and learning to live in ways thathelp make our communities more resilient to our fire-
prone future.

Coalition promotes Rockies motherlode of natural gas as sour.txt,"Coalition promotes Rockies' motherlode of natural gas as source for
overseas markets
An organization formed to develop international markets for the Rockies' abundant natural gas is forging ahead despite low prices and setbacks in building an export terminal on the Oregon coast that would connect the region to overseas buyers.
The Western States and Tribal Nations Natural Gas Initiative just named its first board of directors. It will soon release a report looking at how much greenhouse-gas emissions could be reduced if natural gas produced in the Rockies replaced coal-fired electricity in other countries. Andrew Browning, Western States' president, and Duane Zavadil, a board member and formerly an executive with the Bill Barrett Corp., acknowledge that the headwinds facing the group are strong. Natural gas prices remain low. Demand for oil and gas that plunged when the pandemic hit has risen, but is not expected to reach 2019 levels until 2029, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. There's the growing opposition to drilling from those who favor renewable energy and fear the worsening impacts of climate change. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is more than 80 times more powerful in the near term than carbon dioxide is at trapping heat. Another challenge: the embattled Jordan Cove liquified natural gas export terminal, proposed in Coos Bay, Ore., remains in limbo after federal regulators said it can't move forward without a clean water permit from the state. The Associated Press reported the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected an appeal in January from energy company Pembina Pipeline Corp., which had challenged Oregon's denial of the permit.
But Browning, a Denver-based partner with HBW Resources, a consulting and advocacy firm, is bullish on LNG  natural gas cooled to its liquid form so it can be shipped more easily. ""I think that while the current market conditions are tough, LNG producers who get a toehold on the North American West Coast are moving forward. I think the fundamentals for future growth are sound, even in this tough economic environment,"" said Browning, an appointee to the Department of Energy during the Clinton administration. The country's LNG exports are at record levels and the market is strong, said Bernadette Johnson, vice president of strategic analytics at Enverus in Denver. ""I think the tricky part is where you're at. If you're in Colorado, you're just geographically disadvantaged,"" Johnson said.
The Rockies are competing with other gas-producing parts of the country that are closer to markets, Johnson added. As for building export terminals on the West Coast, it's a ""tricky environment,"" she said.. Opponents of Jordan Cove include area landowners and environmentalists. A recent story by The Oregonian detailed the difficulties that Pembina has had getting state approval of the permits it needs. Construction of the Jordan Cove LNG export terminal in Oregon has been seen as a way to open up markets for the vast natural gas reserves in Colorado, Utah and surrounding states. That goal was the genesis of the Western States and Tribal Nations initiative. Browning said the organization took form after work by the West Slope Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Association and a conference by the Utah governor's energy office.
In 2018, the Colorado Energy Office and the Utah Governor's Office of Energy Development commissioned a report on natural gas markets for Western states and tribes. It focused on the Piceance Basin in western Colorado and Utah's Uintah Basin. Among the report's recommendations was starting a nonprofit organization to promote the region.
The state of Colorado withdrew from the group after Gov. Jared Polis took office. The Polis administration's energy priorities include a transition to a 100% renewable energy future, zero-emission vehicles and addressing climate change, spokeswoman Heatheryn Higgins said in an email. Four Colorado counties are still members: Garfield, Rio Blanco, Moffat and Mesa. New Mexico and Utah state officials, the Ute Indian Tribe, the state of Baja California, Mexico, and the Wyoming Energy Authority, a state agency, also belong to the coalition. ""We don't have as much strength as a coalition without the state,"" said Garfield County Commissioner Tom Jankovsky.
But Jankovsky said it's important for his county and others in northwest Colorado to participate because they have a bigger voice as members of a coalition. He wants to see Colorado gas producers get in on the demand for LNG in Asian countries and elsewhere that, according to Bloomberg, has sent prices soaring. ""The big thing is if we can get natural gas exported, we believe it will drive up the price of natural gas,"" Jankovsky said. Higher natural gas prices would help spur production in the Rockies, which hold 502 trillion cubic feet of gas, according to a 2019 report by the Potential Gas Committee, which includes industry representatives and gets input from state and federal experts. 
A trillion cubic feet of natural gas is enough to heat 15 million homes for one year, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Despite the wealth of natural gas in northwest Colorado, the San Juan Basin in southwest Colorado and northern New Mexico and throughout the Rockies, low prices coupled with transportation costs have resulted in declining development in spots without the draw of oil.
Rising oil prices have spurred more activity in the Permian Basin in West Texas and southeast New Mexico. Drilling rigs are up slightly in the Denver-Julesburg Basin along Colorado's Front Range. However, natural gas prices remain low, roughly $2.80 per million BTU. The price was at least three times higher during a boom on the West Slope in the early to mid-2000s. Much of the natural gas in northwestern Colorado is under federally managed lands, which means the moratorium by President Joe Biden's administration on new leasing on public lands would apply. Jankovsky said more than 90% of the public lands in Garfield County are leased.
Browning said the industry anticipated that Biden would look at developing energy policies ""through the prism of climate change."" That's why the coalition has contracted with the authors of a 2018 report that said replacing coal to generate electricity with LNG exports from western Canada could significantly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in other countries.
Browning said the coalition has asked some of the authors, which included John Hopkins University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to expand the study to consider effects of displacing coalfired electricity in other countries with natural gas from the Rockies. The coalition has proposed working with New Mexico and college officials to retrain employees of coal plants and mines to apply technology to reduce methane emissions from natural gas. Colorado has some of the country's strongest methane regulations. The Biden administration is looking at reinstating federal methane regulations rolled back by the Trump administration. Coalition board member Zavadil said, given the growing worry about climate change and companies and investors concentrating more on environmental and social issues, he believes ""the price of admission"" to the LNG markets will be strict standards for methane emissions. He said he's confident that producers in the Rockies can deliver.
""The best way to address climate change is to allow our producers to produce under the most effective standards and protocols available, allow them to export and displace much dirtier fuels that are being used elsewhere,"" Browning said. The best way to deal with climate change is to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, said Pete Kolbenschlag, a Paonia resident and consultant to community groups that have campaigned for limiting oil and gas development. ""Expanding fossil fuel infrastructure is doubling-down on the past we need to quickly leave behind,"" Kolbenschlag said in an email. ""While LNG will play some role in nations moving past coal, it is highly unlikely that all the projects being boosted by booster-groups will make it across the finish line, or be successful if they do."""
Colo.s_prison_firefighters_have_path_to_permanent__Denver_Post_The_CO___April_20_2021__p4A.txt,"Co lo .'s p riso n fire fighters have p ath to p e rmane nt - De nve r Po st, The (CO ) - Ap ril 20, 2021 - p age 4A
The dozens of people in Colorado prisons who fight wildfires are largely locked out of the firefighting sector once they get out, but a new state law promises to change that.
The law -- passed overwhelmingly by the state legislature and signed Thursday by Gov. Jared Polis - encourages the state Division of Fire Prevention and Control to give hiring preference to formerly incarcerated people with firefighting experience.
It also requires that the Department of Corrections educate prison firefighters about post-release employment in the field and establishes a peer mentorship program for those firefighters. These changes must be implemented by July 2022.
""Making it possible for these individuals to use their skills and training to find work once they are released helps increase public safety and reduce their chances of committing another crime and coming back into our custody,"" Department of Corrections Director Dean Williams said. ""When people have a job, a place to live, community connections and a larger purpose once they are released, they are much more likely to be contributing members of society. There is dignity in work and being productive again.""
Men who fought fires while incarcerated in Colorado are barred from working for urban fire departments because their felony convictions preclude them from getting EMT licenses. This new law won't change that. And while they have been not formally banned from many wildland firefighting departments, stigma and lack of awareness of employment opportunities have kept them from getting jobs with rare exceptions.
One of the sponsors of the new law, Rep. Dylan Roberts, said in a recent speech on the Colorado House floor that the bill is a win for the prisoners and for the public.
""We better equip our state to fire forest fires that we all know are increasing at an alarming rate, and we offer formerly incarcerated individuals a path back into our communities with a solid employment opportunity,"" the Avon Democrat said.
The inmate firefighting program has been suspended due to COVID-19, but pre-pandemic there were about 75 people participating among three different teams in Caon City, Buena Vista and Rifle. They are all men, convicted of non-violent offenses and eligible for parole within three years.
Hundreds apply annually, in part because they receive one day off their sentences for each day they are in the field. The incarcerated firefighters also earn about $6 per day of labor -- a relatively large figure compared to wages for other jobs in prison.

Coloradans_Urged_to_Reduce_Wildfire_Risk_While__Estes_Park_Trail-Gazette_CO___May_2_2020.txt,"Co lo radans Urge d to Re duce Wildfire Risk While - Este s Park Trail-Gaze tte (CO ) - May 2, 2020
May 2, 2020  Estes Park Trail-Gazette (CO)  Colorado State Forest Service
With fire seasons becoming longer, more intense and more damaging over the last few decades in Colorado, state and federal agencies that manage wildfires and forests are urging residents to join in efforts to reduce wildfire risk, while following stay-at-home and safer-at-home directives.
Today, Governor Jared Polis signed a proclamation declaring May as Wildfire Awareness Month, an annual observance to encourage all citizens to better prepare their homes and communities for wildfires. With about half of all Coloradans  about 3 million people  living in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), it's important for people to take action to reduce the risk wildfire poses to their homes and create more fire-adapted communities.
The Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control anticipates an average wildfire potential into mid-summer, but that does not mean Coloradans should be lax in preparing for fires. During an average year, Colorado will see about 4,500 wildfires that burn around 168,000 acres, including several large fires. With the coronavirus creating challenges for firefighters this year, including less flexibility and fewer resources, residents should do what they can now to ease the burden on first responders if a wildfire poses a threat to their community.
Wildfire knows no boundaries; it does not recognize jurisdictional responsibilities. A single wildfire often crosses private, county, state, tribal and federal lands and threatens communities across all landscapes. ""The number of people at risk of wildfires in Colorado continues to increase,"" said DFPC Director Mike Morgan. ""Approximately 3 million people live in Colorado's wildland-urban interface  compared to 2 million people just five years ago. We encourage landowners and communities to become aware of their level of risk and be a part of the solution.""
Practical Steps While Staying at Home
With Wildfire Preparedness Day on Saturday, May 2, many communities across Colorado will be taking steps to reduce their risk of fire . Colorado is home to more than 180 official Firewise USA sites, places where neighbors are working together to reduce their risk.
Whether they live in a Firewise community or not, homeowners living in the WUI can do a number of practical activities to protect their residence from fire while staying home and practicing social distancing. The Colorado State Forest Service recommends the following wildfire preparation activities:
 Rake and remove pine needles and dry leaves 5 feet from the home, as well as under decks, porches, sheds and play structures.
 Remove leaves and needles from roofs and gutters.
 Sweep porches and decks clear of any burnable plant material.
 Move firewood piles at least 30 feet from the house, preferably uphill.
 T ransfer items under decks or porches to a storage area.
 Cover any exposed eave or attic vents with 1/8-inch metal mesh screening.
 Ensure home address signs are clearly visible from the street.
 Contact your local Office of Emergency Management to register for emergency notifications and encourage your friends, family and neighbors to do the same.
 Confirm at least one alternate path out of your neighborhood other than the one most commonly used and be prepared for potential evacuation requiring the alternative route.
""Accomplishing these simple tasks will increase the chances your home will survive a wildfire,"" said Mike Lester, state forester and director of the CSFS. ""These are activities you can do on your own, while you're stuck at home. Not only will you be preparing yourself, your home and your family for a potential fire, you'll be giving a leg up to firefighters who may be called to protect your home.""
Prevention When Outdoors
In early April, Jennifer Eberlien, acting regional forester for the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Region, announced fire restrictions on national forests and grasslands in Colorado and surrounding states to help prevent human-caused fires, which in turn can help prevent the overtaxing of county and state fire and medical resources. Some Colorado counties have followed suit. While many campgrounds and recreation areas remain closed across the state, people who head into the forest should check fire restrictions and do their part to prevent wildfires.
Fire management agencies are operating under novel constraints due to the coronavirus. That said, wildland fire agencies are incredibly proficient in emergency response and are actively assessing potential risks and developing plans to mitigate those risks as progress in the response to COVID-19 continues. While COVID-19 circumstances are rapidly evolving  and federal guidance continues to adapt with the situation  the wildland fire agencies are prepared for wildland fire activity and will be ready to respond during a COVID-19 outbreak. Still, variable quarantine guidelines will impact resource sharing, interstate travel and other traditional incident management practices in a novel way, making individual land and homeowner wildfire preparedness and prevention all the more important during this fire season.
Wildland fire management in Colorado is an interagency partnership among local, state and federal agencies. The Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control and USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Region work with other local, state and federal agencies to coordinate wildland fire management on a statewide basis. The Colorado State Forest Service works with the National Fire Protection Association to implement the Firewise USA prog ram in the state and provides technical assistance to homeowners and communities to help them take action and ownership in preparing their homes against the threat of wildfire.
By working together in these efforts, the ultimate goals of these agencies are resilient, fire-
adapted Colorado landscapes and communities that best provide for firefighter and public safety.

Colorado and Summit officials plan for wildfire season.txt,"Colorado and Summit officials plan for wildfire season
Local, state and federal officials are preparing for what could be another troubling wildfire season in
Colorado.
The Colorado Division of Fire Prevention & Control released the state's 2021 Wildfire Preparedness Plan earlier this month, a document that outlines the state's wildfire outlook, firefighting resources and recommendations for improving operations in the future, among other points.
The plan begins by reflecting on the 2020 wildfire season and trying to contextualize the growing dangers of wildfires in Colorado at large. Members of the public are well aware by now that the three largest wildfires in the state's history all unfolded last year: the 208,913-acre Cameron Peak Fire, the 193,812acre East Troublesome Fire and the 139,007-acre Pine Gulch Fire. Though the report highlights the fact that fire conditions have been steadily worsening in Colorado and around the country for decades. The core fire season in the United States is an average of 78 days longer today than it was in the 1970s, and the number and severity of fires continue to trend in the wrong direction. In the 1960s, there was an average of 457 wildfires that burned 8,170 acres annually in Colorado, according to the report. Between 2011 and 2020, the average number of fires grew to 5,359, and the average acres burned grew to 233,728. All 20 of the state's biggest recorded wildfires in historyhave occurred within the past 20 years. 
Locally, officials have recognized similar patterns.
""Former Summit Fire & EMS Chief Jeff Berino used to say that we weren't out of fire season until there was a foot of snow on the ground,"" Summit County Sheriff Jaime FitzSimons said. ""I would tell you that's still a pretty good gauge, but that foot of snow, where it used to be in September or October, is now coming in December or January. And that foot of snow on the ground that used to last into June lasts to March now.  So when we used to be able to breathe  we literally would be able to pause  now with our weather cycles and climate change, we talk about it year-round.""
The state's plan also presents a bleak picture of how the trend will unfold in the coming decades, suggesting that by 2050 the burn area around the nation could double, increasing as much as five-fold in Colorado. The report also anticipates the number of homes in Colorado's wildland-urban interface to more than double over the next 10 years.
The plan also characterizes the immense costs of battling wildfires. According to the report, there were 16 state-responsibility fires last year, with an estimated suppression cost of $38 million in state funds and another $248 million in federal funds. The state takes responsibility for fires that have exceeded the capabilities of individual fire districts and counties to handle alone, which means the already considerable price tag doesn't include suppression costs for local agencies nor does it include additional expenses caused by property loss, watershed impacts and economic losses as a result of fires. The numbers also don't take into account all of the local, county and federal expenses on wildfires that were not the responsibility of the state.
Having provided an overview of the growing costs and stakes of fire suppression in Colorado, the report dives into the wildfire outlook for this year. The plan notes that it's too early to forecast with much accuracy what the season will bring but that Rocky Mountain Area Predictive Services models predict an above average potential for large fires based on temperature and precipitation outlooks. The plan also suggests an ""earlier than normal start to the core fire season,"" which Summit County has already experienced with a pair of minor ignitions already this year.
Local officials said they don't like to plan ahead based on forecasts, as conditions can change rapidly. Though, they're bracing for a potentially long season.
""We don't have the crystal ball, so we don't know what the summer weather will bring,"" Summit Fire spokesperson Steve Lipsher said. ""But we're in the business of preparing for the worst and hoping that we never realize it. So to that end, all of our line firefighters and medics are refreshing their certifications, taking their continuing education efforts, making sure all of their equipment is ready and sharpening their skills  even now as we're still getting regular snowfall."" The state's plan and local fire managers emphasized that early detection and strong initial attacks would be key factors in reducing risks to firefighters and the public as well as minimizing a fire's size, duration, costs and overall impact.
The initial attack on a wildfire generally falls under the jurisdiction of local fire protection districts. If the fire exceeds the capability of the districts to manage it  which usually includes mutual-aid assistance from neighboring counties and federal land agencies  responsibility is delegated to the local sheriff, who requests additional assistance from state and federal partners. Once a fire is delegated to the state, Colorado funds are opened up to help pay for suppression efforts through the Emergency Fire Fund, which agencies and governments around the state pay into annually  about $30,000 a year from Summit County alone.
But this year the state has taken steps to expand the help it can provide to local fire jurisdictions during the initial attack phase of a fire, which in turn could help reduce the number of state-responsibility fires. The concept is called Enhanced State Assistance and this year will allow for any state resources to be used during the initial attack, including air support. The change is meant to provide fire managers with more flexibility to use the appropriate resources during initial attack and reduce financial barriers for rapid action.
Though, Summit County officials haven't traditionally been shy about calling in bigger and better resources to help.
""The overwhelming mindsethere is that all of those incident commanders and chiefs have the support and authority to order the resources they need immediately,"" Emergency Management Director Brian Bovaird said. ""In the past, we have developed a culture that's basically, 'forget about the money.' Those first few hours, if we can catch it and get some resources, the cost saving is monumental."" But it doesn't necessarily mean any jurisdiction can get the resources they request immediately. Lipsher said fire districts are often competing for resources at a state and regional level, meaning some agencies   based on prioritization  might be left to their own mutual-aid agreements and engines until extra help is freed up.
Though, the resources the state will offer in 2021 are considerable. The state will strategically place resources around Colorado  interspersed with federal resources to provide the quickest response  based on variables like fire occurrence, weather, the location of other resources and the National Fire Danger Rating System indices.
Available resources include staffed fire engines and firefighter modules located throughout the state. Colorado also operates a State Wildland Inmate Fire Team through the Colorado Department of Corrections and a heavy equipment program with the Colorado Department of Transportation to supply bulldozers, road graders and other equipment for fire suppression.
In terms of aviation resources, the state will offer at least two multimission aircraft, two single-engine air tankers, a large air tanker and two helicopters to provide reconnaissance, transportation of personnel and supplies, water delivery and more. One helicopter is equipped with night operation capabilities, making Colorado the only state in the country able to perform night operations in the air, according to the plan. The state is also developing a new Firehawk helicopter for use in the future, and the Colorado Army National Guard can provide up to six Black Hawk and two Chinook helicopters for wildfire response. As state agencies prepare for wildfire season, local officials have been gearing up, as well. In addition to long-term mitigation efforts like the county's chipping and fuels reduction programs, officials are also in the process of untangling the county's fire restrictions. Currently, Summit County operates under yearround restrictions but is considering returning to a traditional model wherein the Summit Board of County
Commissioners would enact Stage 1 and 2 restrictions based on need.
FitzSimons said the change at the county level could happen as soon as next week, followed by efforts to adjust current intergovernmental agreements with the county's towns. The hope is that restrictions will better align with other agencies and government entities on the Western Slope and be easier to understand and follow for community members. The ultimate goal is a reduction in human-caused fires. Officials also urged community members to be prepared with an emergency kit in their cars in case of a sudden evacuation, complete with extra clothes, money, toiletries, medications, important documents and everything else that could be needed.
""For those of us who live in wildfire country, the responsibility is not just with the first responders, the firefighters or the federal government to come and put out the massive fires burning throughout our public lands,"" Lipsher said. ""It's incumbent on all of us, down to the community level, the neighborhood level and ultimately to the individual level.  We've gone a long way toward educating our residents and business owners about the importance of being prepared for a wildfire all summer long, and we've seen great strides."""
Colorado College achieves decadelong goal of carbon neutrali.txt,"Colorado College achieves decade-long goal of carbon neutrality
Flip the calendar back to 2007, when Colorado College sophomore David Amster-Olszewski circulated a petition that 70% of the school's 2,000 students signed in just 10 days, calling for the campus to commit to reaching carbon neutrality.
Two years later, the campus set 2020 as the date to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from certain campus operations and use renewable energy sources. On Friday comes the celebration for the goal being realized. Amster-Olszewski, whose career in renewable energy was launched by that student-led drive, said he knew the grassroots initiative was achievable.
""We were looking for how do we address climate change not just for the college but in a way that sets a precedent and serves as an example for others to see this is possible,"" he said. ""There were a lot of questions, since it had never been done before  is this something the college could commit to, would the technology be there, would it be a significant added expense that would raise  tuition?
The accomplishment proves the naysayers wrong, Amster-Olszewski said, and ""validates the concept if you set bold goals, you'll find ways to achieve them.""
Clean energy is now the modus operandi at the private liberal arts college in Colorado Springs, from electricity to fleet transportation, heating and cooling systems, waste material and air travel. Colorado College claims the title of being the first in the city, state and Rocky Mountain region to accomplish the milestone of carbon neutrality and the eighth educational institution in the nation to do so. ""We've reduced on-campus emissions by 75% over the past decade, which is a huge number,"" said Ian Johnson, sustainability director for the school's Office of Sustainability.
It's the largest carbon footprint decrease among the nation's seven other carbon-neutral colleges, according to Colorado College officials 
""Other institutions have goals of becoming carbon neutral by 2040 or 2050,"" said Paige Shetty, greenhouse gas inventory intern in the Office of Sustainability.
""It's pretty remarkable we did it in 11 years and are using the lowest number of carbon offsets. Nobody wants carbon neutrality to be offset with money.""
Johnson said 6% of the campus' electricity, or 1 megawatt, is powered by solar panels on such buildings as the expanded Tutt Library  which also features geothermal energy  the college radio station and dorms, along with off-site community solar arrays operated by third-party developers. Helping push the college into the realm of 100% solar power was the Jan. 1 kickoff of a new Colorado Springs Utilities' Green Power program that enables commercial and residential electric users to buy solar directly from the municipal utilities company to power homes or businesses. Customer demand for a renewable-energy option led to the program, said spokeswoman Amy Trinidad. Two solar arrays, one that came online in November in Calhan and another that will be operational in March, are providing the sun power.
""Colorado College made the decision to replace all their electric needs with the solar power green tariff, and it's huge that they were able to reach their goal,"" said Steve Payne, a Utilities portfolio manager who handles the school's account.
CC also offsets emissions from campus vehicles, air and business travel, liquid and solid waste, and HVAC systems with renewable energy credits that reduce or eliminate greenhouse gases elsewhere. The college has spent $250,000 annually on sustainability projects since 2013, for a total of $1.5 million, and saved $6.6 million from going to renewable energy, Johnson said, which ""makes financial sense."" Among its investments, Colorado College owns part of a methane destruction project at the Larimer County landfill in northern Colorado, for example, which prevents methane from entering the atmosphere, instead using it to generate electricity for county use.
What the campus has not done is divest of oil and gas company investments in its nearly $800 million endowment portfolio, which has been a rallying cry from students for years. ""It's been an ongoing conversation with the Board of Trustees,"" Johnson said, particularly how does divestiture from fossil fuel producers impact returns, since interest partially funds student scholarships and study-abroad programs, and how does it affect companies. While recent research indicates returns are on par with traditional investments, fund managers are reluctant to share where all the money is being invested, he said. And the $7 trillion collectively divested from fossil fuels ""hasn't moved the needle"" on stock value for companies such as Shell, Exxon, Mobil, BP, Chevron and others, Johnson said. Such companies also are leading renewable energy research and development, he said.
""It's a confounding issue,"" he said. ""There's a massive effort to divest, but we're not seeing it changes things.""
After former Colorado College president Dick Celeste put his name on the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment to address global warming, Amster-Olszewski went on to install the first solar panel on campus. Over the last two months of the academic year in 2008, AmsterOlszewski raised $200,000 to buy and erect a 25-kilowatt solar array on a dorm, the equivalent of five
homes in Colorado Springs and the largest nonmilitary setup in the city at the time. In 2011, Amster-Olszewski founded Sun Share Community Solar, a Denver-based company that instead of mounting panels on roofs builds large ""community solar gardens,"" which allow residents to share renewable energy and earn utility-bill credits. 
""I feel climate change is one of those existential threats similar to World War II, where everybody has to band together to solve the problem,"" he said. ""You'll invariably find a solution, even if you don't know what the solution is when you start.""
No matter where people stand on the politics of the topic, climate change is the defining issue of the current generation, said Colorado College student body president Ethan Greenberg. ""It's in the front of the minds for my peers and current students, who see it as an issue that disproportionately is felt along class and race lines, affecting low-income people, communities of color and refugees who lack stable housing,"" he said. ""We see it as the challenge of our generation."" The campus isn't done, Johnson said.
""We haven't solved climate change,"" he said. ""We've been good at the technical and efficiency pieces, with energy reduction and replacing fossil fuels with solar, but the thing moving forward is behavioral change.""
Students in two sustainable-living houses are studying water use, thermostat control, toilet flushing, cooking methods, gardening and food production to see how small lifestyle changes can add up. Reaching carbon neutrality was ""a heavy lift,"" said senior Lily Weissgold, an economics and environmental studies major who worked on a project to install LED light fixtures in local schools to buy net carbon offsets for the college. ""But we haven't really felt the pain."" Among students, there's vocal buy-in and general ambivalence about the project, she said. ""They assume the administration is green-washing, or things aren't really as good as they seem,"" Weissgold said. ""Those genuinely keyed in realize it's a good-faith effort, and there's positive sentiment. It's something everybody should be thinking about.

Colorado drought conditions still critical for Western Slope.txt,"Colorado drought conditions still critical for Western Slope

A July 1 declaration of a drought emergency for Western Colorado by Gov. Jared Polis opens up federal
and state dollars to help those most affected by the lack of moisture.
As of July 1, the US Drought Monitor lists 18 counties as being in extreme or exceptional drought.
Extreme drought means that pasture conditions get worse, city landscapes start to die, and the risk for
large fires increase. For recreation and tourism, the impacts include fish kills, and lower stream flows for
rafting and fishing.
At the most extreme drought level, agriculture and recreation can expect large economic losses, water
temperatures in lakes and rivers increase and mandatory water restrictions are often imposed.
The governor's declaration is the third, and most serious, phase tied to the state's Drought Plan. Polis
last activated the state's drought plan just a year ago, for 40 out of Colorado's 64 counties.
Megan Holcomb, a senior climate specialist with the Colorado Water Conservation Board, said the first
phase allows for a close watch on condition for a persistent or rapidly worsening drought. The second
phase activates several task forces, with the potential for a drought emergency. The third phase is the
actual declaration.
Activating the drought plan opens up limited state funds, including two emergency drought funds
controlled by the CWCB as well as year-round drought Planning Grants.
One $500,000 fund deals with flood and drought response; the other is $1 million for emergency
agricultural water augmentation. Those grants go to agricultural organizations for water that would have
been purchased in a non-drought year.
However, Holcomb said, most of the money that will go to deal with the drought comes from federal
funds. Those include the USDA Farm Service Agency Disaster Assistance Programs and the USDA
Rural Development: Emergency Community Water Assistance Grants.
The latter could be a boon to Glenwood Springs. A series of mudslides in Glenwood Canyon over the
past week has not only led to detours but to water restrictions. Last week, the city asked residents to
limit water usage until June 30. The city also has asked residents to avoid watering lawns at certain
times of the day.
Last week's water restrictions were in response to heavy rains that reduced the amount of water the
Glenwood Springs municipal water system could treat. Those rains resulted in sediment and debris.
The drought emergency declaration ""acts as an opportunity for the Governor to raise awareness of
drought conditions, and shows his increased readiness and support to state and local partners as they
provide emergency services as needed,"" Holcomb said in a statement to Colorado Politics.
During the most recent meeting of the state's Water Availability Task Force, assistant state climatologist
Becky Bollinger of Colorado State University said temperatures between March and May averaged 1 to
3 degrees warmer along the Western Slope, while temperature on the Front Range and Eastern Plains
have been average. But June has been worse, and those above-average temperatures also have
affected the Front Range and northern Eastern Plains.
The good news, she said, is that May was the wettest for the Front Range and Eastern Plains it has
been since 2015 and 11th wettest on record. Western Colorado was drier than average, particularly
around Durango and the San Juan Mountains, she said.
Three counties  Routt, San Miguel and Montrose  didn't seen any precipitation through the third
week of June, she said.
In Routt County, the Yampa River reached a temperature of 75 degrees on Sunday. Two days at that
temperature and Steamboat Springs would shut down the river through town, which would close
recreational activities such as boating and fishing. The Yampa River south of Stagecoach Reservoir has
been closed to fishing since May because of critically low stream flows.
As to any hope of relief, Bollinger said that long-range precipitation forecasts for July show average or
below-average precipitation. Long-range forecasts show high probability of warmer-than-average
temperatures and drier-than-average conditions, she explained.
In addition, monsoon patterns are not going to come to Colorado's aid, Bollinger indicated. Climate
change is weakening the Jetstream pattern and that negatively impacts average precipitation, although
modeling is showing near-average rain, she said.
Karl Wetlaufer, a hydrologist with the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, pointed out that
the White and Yampa river basins saw some of the state's most meager precipitation, with just 29% of
average in June. The Upper Colorado River Basin had a good May, receiving 91% of its normal
precipitation, but June was the exact opposite, at just 12% of normal rainfall.
Most of the area's reservoirs are at 75% or more full, which Wetlaufer said will allow for a buffer in water
management throughout the rest of the summer. Denver Water announced Monday that Dillon Reservoir
is now 100% full.
The one bright spot: for the Eastern Plains, reservoirs on the South Platte are on average near capacity,
thanks to above-average rainfall in May.

Colorado far from meeting emissionsreduction goals report sa.txt,"Colorado far from meeting emissions-reduction goals, report says
May 14, 2021  Daily Record, The (Caon City, CO)
Author: Judith Kohler Section: Business 804 Words
OpenURL Link
A new report says Colorado will fall drastically short of its goals for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions
without more ambitious targets and enforceable limits on pollution, a feature of a bill in the legislature that
has Gov. Jared Polis threatening a veto.
The analysis released Friday by Energy Innovation and RMI, formerly Rocky Mountain Institute, says
their modeling projects Colorado's overall emissions will drop from 2005 levels by just 3.4% by 2030 and
only 18% by 2050. That's a long way from the goals of at least 50% by 2030 and 90% by 2050 set by a
2019 law and in the ""Colorado Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction Roadmap"" issued by Polis in
January.
The state law includes the near-term goal of a 26% decline in emissions by 2025. Supporters of Senate
Bill 21-200 say the specific limits on emissions in the new bill are intended to build upon the objectives
set by previous legislation and the governor's road map.
""Our climate goals are only as strong as our plans to execute them. This bill takes Gov. Polis' climate
goals and works to ensure that his plan happens,"" said Kelly Nordini, executive director of Conservation
Colorado. ""If the governor's team has another way of building more certainty into their road map, we'd
love to hear that.""
As a candidate and after taking office in 2019, Polis has focused on addressing climate change,
strengthening oil and gas regulations and increasing the use of renewable energy and electric vehicles.
He campaigned on making Colorado's electric grid free of fossil fuels by 2040.
But Polis has threatened to veto SB200. He said he supports parts of it, such as establishing an
environmental justice ombudsperson position and advisory board in the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment to work with communities that have been affected by pollution
disproportionately.
However, Polis opposes putting specific emissions caps in law. In an April 27 call with The Denver Post
editorial board, he said he sees the bill as an impediment to emissions-reduction goals. He stressed the
commitments made by nearly all the state's electric utilities to shift to renewable energy.
The governor is working with legislators on climate bills, including one that would make historic
investments in electrifying transportation, Shelby Wieman, Polis' spokeswoman, said in an email.
However, ""The governor has demonstrated that SB200 is a fatally flawed bill that would set back our
state's climate leadership and slow our efforts to combat climate change,"" Wieman said.
Rep. Dominique Jackson, a Democrat from Aurora and one of the bill's main sponsors, said Friday that
she believes there is still a path forward on the legislation and that lawmakers stand ""with open arms and
a willingness to talk"" with the governor.
Asked if there are talks of a compromise, Jackson said: ""We're clear on our goals. The administration is
well aware that we want measurable, actionable, equitable action on climate change.""
Referring to Colorado's policies, a lot of promising action has occurred, but more is needed, said Kyle
Clark-Sutton with RMI and one of the authors of the new report on Colorado.
""There's a lot of value we've seen in other states, and history tells us that enforceable targets are useful
in ensuring that states hit their goals when it comes to reducing emissions,"" Clark-Sutton said.
The two research and policy organizations used national data and analysis by the state to project
Colorado's progress.
""The big takeaway is that Colorado is off track in terms of hitting its goals,"" Clark-Sutton said. ""More
modeling is needed to better understand which policies can have the highest impact.""
This isn't the first analysis to warn that Colorado is on a trajectory to missing its objectives. A recent
report by the Environmental Defense Fund said the state is expected to cut emissions by just 7% to 16%
by 2025 and 19% to 26% in 2030.
The governor's own road map shows gaps between the goals and projections, said Stacy Tellinghuisen,
senior climate policy analyst at the Boulder-based Western Resource Advocates. For example, the road
map shows the state falling short of its 2025 goal of 26% reductions by 15 million metric tons of
emissions to 34 million metric tons.
Tellinghuisen said one of the conservation community's frustrations is that there are no mechanisms for
achieving many of the goals. She said SB200 would give state agencies the authority to adopt ambitious
policies.
One of Polis' critiques of the legislation is that it would give the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission
""dictatorial control"" over the economy. The bill directs the commission to develop rules by March 1,
2022, to implement the law.
Tellinghuisen said the bill's supporters see the commission as ""an overarching project manager"" that
would take into account actions by other agencies and the legislature. The bill provides flexibility to adjust
targets among economic sectors as long as the overall mark is met, she added.

Colorado fire updates Sylvan Fire in Eagle County grows to 3.txt,"Colorado fire updates: Sylvan Fire in Eagle County grows to 3,583
acres
Colorado wildfireseason is off to a vicious start. Four fires that sparked across the state over the weekend are still not fully contained, according to Inciweb. One of those fires is the Sylvan Fire, which sparked around 3:15 p.m. Sunday less than a mile from the campground at Sylvan Lake State Park. During a community briefing Monday evening, Justin Conrad, U.S. Forest Service Sylvan Fire management officer, said crews are working to contain the blaze on three sides and direct it toward Red Table Mountain where vegetation to fuel the blaze is sparse.
""Currently the fire is staying within the area we are intending it to stay in,"" Conrad said. According to David Boyd of the U.S. Forest Service, firefighters are making progress securing fire line on the east and west sides of the fire. The fire is burning in timber on the White River National Forest about half a mile from Sylvan Lake State Park. The cause is under investigation, but lightning is suspected. During the Monday briefing, Conrad noted that currently, the fire is not threatening any structures. That was an increased concern for downvalley residents who watched the fire plume grow substantially Monday afternoon. Conrad said crews are trying to use natural barriers to direct the fire away from populated areas and currently the fire is burning in a remote area.
As of Tuesday, June 22, there are six wildfires burning in Colorado. Two of those fires  the Straight Creek Fire in Summit County and the Vosburg Pike Fire near Durango  are 100% contained. Eagle County is currently under Stage 1 fire restrictions, which prohibit open fires, fireworks and smoking in undesignated areas, among other things. Wildfire danger is rated as ""very high.""

Colorado governor releases final plan to reduce emissions by.txt,"Colorado governor releases final plan to reduce emissions by 90% The Air Quality Control Commission is responsible for reducing
carbon dioxide emissions

The state released its final version of the highly touted ""Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction Roadmap"" Thursday, claiming it lays down the path and the timing of specific rules and legislation to achieve massive emissions reductions. But environmental advocates said it still is too vague to guarantee real change.
The report by Gov. Jared Polis and his climate change team, required by previous groundbreaking legislation, is meant to map the role of state departments and commissions in achieving 90% reductions in 2005 emissions levels by 2050. Polis said Colorado has already achieved a 40% reduction, ahead of midpoint targets, but needs to accelerate carbon dioxide reduction in the three key areas of electric generation, oil and gas production, and transportation. Separate from the roadmap's targets, Polis has set the goal of 100% renewable energy use in the state in less than two decades.
The environmental imperative, Polis said in releasing the final report, is even more obvious now than when he took office two years ago with pledges to combat the greenhouse effect of climate change. The events Colorado ""couldn't have imagined"" include three massive drought-driven wildfires in 2020 alone that grew into the largest in state history, Polis said, as well as an ongoing drought that is becoming the norm rather than the exception.
Scenes of wildfire evacuation across the state in 2020 served as ""a stark reminder that climate refugees don't only live near the oceans on the coast, but righthere in Colorado,"" Polis said. The roadmap calls on the Public Utilities Commission, for example, to make the target 80% reduction in electric power emissions by 2030 a ""floor"" rather than the ceiling, and Polis said rapid reductions in the cost of utility-scale solar and wind energy make further reductions attainable. Regulators are joining with advocates for creating timelines for drafting new regulations at the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to reduce high emissions from drilling, production and refining, and many of those rules will be finished in 2021. 
The Air Quality Control Commission has the much more complex task of reducing carbon dioxide from millions of vehicles, from industrial and office buildings, and from widely dispersed sources across the state. Colorado has matched California's standards for increases in sales of electric-powered vehicles, whose energy source is far cleaner than petroleum, but other specifics are lacking. Environmentalists and some legislators have criticized the draft roadmap for not having clear programs and firm timelines and deadlines for action.
The final plan does set out a range of actions and rulemakings for the next two years. Many of them, however, were already on calendars of air, utility and oil and gas regulatory commissions, and some remain to be defined.
Asked what was added to give the roadmap more specific direction since the draft was criticized, Polis pointed to language addressing inequity in climate change impacts and how those can be remedied. The report pledges, for example, to build more equity-focused community outreach into the rulemaking process, and to include equity analysis in reviews such as permitting and siting pollution sources. Later Thursday, the governor's office pointed to other specific emission policies in the report, including examples such as required reductions in vehicle trips by large employers, a rulemaking process that will start this summer.
State Sen. Faith Winter, a Democrat representing Thornton, Northglenn and Westminster, said the roadmap now includes more specific timelines and measurable goals in climate equity work. ""What's being released today is a significant step forward,"" Winter said. ""We need to prioritize equity first and foremost; historically disadvantaged communities have borne the brunt of climate change."" Rep. Alex Valdez, a Denver Democrat, said equity goals will include more access to electric vehicles and charging stations, for example, in underserved Denver neighborhoods. ""I represent one of the most polluted ZIP codes in the United States, and they'll be very happy to hear we are taking bold steps.""  Environmental advocates said equity needs are urgent, and plans like the greenhouse gas roadmap don't include specific, immediate change.
""Successfully reducing climate pollution and meeting Colorado's climate goals must be done in a way that is quantifiable, enforceable, and equitable,"" Stacy Tellinghuisen, senior climate policy analyst for the environmental group Western Resource Advocates, said in a statement.  Tellinghuisen said a quick review of the finalized roadmap ""still doesn't appear to meet those criteria. Specifically, we've heard from our frontline community partners  and we agree  that the equitable part is missing from the roadmap.""
Achieving the state's climate action plans ""requires engagement and support of disproportionately impacted communities, yet we are still waiting for (the state health department's) equity framework,"" a coalition of conservation advocates said in a release Thursday. ""The delay of this framework signals that disproportionately-impacted communities were not sufficiently consulted or centered, and therefore, are unlikely to reap the benefits that could come from the governor's roadmap."" The final roadmap, in a marked change, does outline a broad range of legislative actions that need to be taken to help meet the emission reduction goals.
Polis, for example, in his budget up for the legislature's approval is proposing $40 million for clean energy financing, and $5 million for local governments for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Other elements that will need legislative action include setting carbon reduction targets for gas utilities and requiring large commercial buildings to track and reduce emissions.
Colorado officials are emphasizing the climate change effort can make large greenhouse gas reductions while still providing safe, reliable and affordable energy for consumers and industry. Polis on Thursday included the comments of renewable power executive Kevin Smith, whose Lightsource BP is building massive solar power arrays in Pueblo that replace coal-fired power generation.
Lightsource BP is finishing the $285 million Bighorn solar array next to the Evraz steel-rail factory in Pueblo, and will soon announce details on another $200 million array there, Smith said. Both the energy arrays and the steel factory are creating hundreds of new jobs, not just because of climate change targets, but because the energy they need will be cheaper.  ""They are expanding the steel mill for rails in part because they now have long-term, cost competitive power,"" Smith said."

During a virtual panel discussion Thursday afternoon, Colorado officials emphasized a need for more
cooperation among federal, state and local actors in Colorado's fight against wildfires.
Rep. Joe Neguse, who serves Colorado's 2nd Congressional District, hosted a public listening session
Thursday, Feb. 18, to gain insights on the impacts and potential solutions to combat growing concerns
about wildfires in the state. The session featured a panel discussion between Neguse, Gov. Jared Polis,
Colorado Department of Public Safety Director Stan Hilkey and Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael
Bennet.
In the wide-ranging discussion, officials shared their perspectives on the changes necessary to protect
Colorado's public lands, property and lives, and they turned to residents for questions and to share their
experiences with local wildfires in recent years.
""It doesn't escape me that the most devastating fires of 2020 burned at a time of the year when snow
should be falling,"" Neguse said. ""Clearly, with the impacts of climate change, the need to promote healthy
forests, the impacts on watershed health and the need to protect homes and businesses, wildfires are
just a complex issue for our communities. There really is no silver bullet, which is why these
conversations are so important so that we can all candidly talk about what steps we might be able to
take in the Congress and the Senate, and of course here in Colorado, working together to solve these
incredible challenges.""
The challenges indeed are incredible. The state saw the three largest wildfires in its recorded history last
year  the Cameron Peak Fire, East Troublesome Fire and Pine Gulch Fire  which scorched nearly
550,000 acres across the state, burning down hundreds of homes and claiming the lives of two
Coloradans. Looking back on the destruction, exacerbated by climate change and historically poor forest
management tactics, officials promised to work toward comprehensive and holistic solutions.
One prevailing theme throughout the session was a need for more robust national support for
Coloradans and other Americans throughout the West dealing with a new age of megafires. Bennet said
the issue would require a hegemonic shift in understanding about the dangers wildfires pose to the
state's infrastructure, environment and economy.
""One of the most important things we can do is change the way Congress thinks about our forests,""
Bennet said. ""Politicians in Washington need to understand that in Colorado, and across the West,
forests are our infrastructure. They are as important to our state's economy as the Lincoln Tunnel is to
New York. But the truth is we have major challenges with this infrastructure. We're now dealing with the
consequences of a century of fire suppression and chronic underfunding for the Forest Service. When
you combine that with climate change, it's put the agency and state and local governments in a nearly
impossible position. 
""We're paying for wildfires after they happen rather than investing on the front end. That's fiscally
irresponsible, and  we need, I think, a major shift at the national level to prioritize forest restoration and
wildfire mitigation  and a major investment to go with it.""
Bennet pointed to his bill, the Outdoor Restoration Force Act, which he said would spur a $40 billion
federal investment in foresthealth, watershed restoration and climate resilience projects across the
country; provide $20 billion in funds allocated to state and local governments; and create 2 million jobs in
rural areas. Neguse also discussed the 21st Century Conservation Corps for Our Health and Our Jobs
Act, which would allocate billions of dollars in funds to restore public lands and watersheds, improve
foresthealth and reduce wildfire risks, among other endeavors.
Officials also highlighted the importance of local initiatives in the wildland-urban interface to mitigate
wildfire risks. Polis likened at-home perimeter defense  like removing trees and building firewise
homes  to biblical tales of Israelites marking their doors with lamb's blood before the 10th plague on the
Egyptians, saying that homeowner mitigation efforts can help the ""angel of destruction"" that is a wildfire
pass over.
Hilkey lauded local governments like Summit County for its efforts to create fire breaks thathelped to
curb destruction during the 2018 Buffalo Mountain Fire, buthe said focusing on the state's ability to fight
fires was equally important to protect communities.
""They had done an enormous amount of mitigation around the subdivision, but it alone did not save the
subdivision,"" Hilkey said. ""It was also an aggressive initial attack. In any public policy conversation we
have about wildfire in the American West, there's sort of two major topics of conversation: mitigation and
suppression.  Much of the time, it seems that people often try to choose one side or another. I want to
encourage us all to resist the urge to do that and understand that mitigation and suppression need our full
support. They're symbiotic to a successful Colorado future when we're talking about wildland fire.""
Prompted by questions from the public, Hilkey and other officials also discussed a need to work with
communities to develop responsibly so chokepoints aren't created during potential evacuations, and to
work with local governments and emergency agencies to study and train for mass evacuations to
ensure they can be done smoothly and safely.
Members of the public also asked for better information during wildfires to keep residents informed about
the status of their homes and properties, more support and funding for firefighters, better recovery efforts
for those who've lost their homes or livelihoods, and help working with insurance companies to make
sure homeowners can be made whole again.
Officials promised to take the conversation to heart as they return to their duties.
""We're in a place where we've got a decision to make about whether we're going to stand up for the next
generation of Coloradans and Americans and leave a legacy that matters,"" Bennet said. ""When you
stand in a forest  that's been treated the way it ought to be treated, it starts to look a little more like a
forest might have looked when Native American people were in Colorado. It's like standing in a cathedral.
That could be our legacy if we pull together and really do the work that needs to be done. I'm grateful for
this. This is a good, inspiring moment for us to take back to Washington and get to work.""
Courtney Walsh, a Boulder resident who losther home in the Calwood Fire, called on all Coloradans to
come together to deal with the growing problem.
""We feel really lucky,"" Walsh said. ""We have our lives. We have our family and friends. We can't imagine
getting through it without this amazing Boulder community. But I wouldn't want anyone to go through
what we've gone through.  All of us together have to work together to prevent future wildfires.""

Colorado oil and gas company aims to produce cleanest.txt,"Colorado oil and gas company aims to produce ""cleanest
molecules"" anywhere

Amid escalating worries about climate change and pollution from oil and gas operations, Colorado's
largest electric utility is going to buy natural gas from a company that is continuously monitoring its
emissions and working to certify its product as responsible.
Xcel Energy said Wednesday that it will buy some of its gas for use in Colorado from Denver-based
Crestone Peak Resources as part of a pilot project to show that it's dedicated to delivering ""a cleaner
energy product."" Xcel was the first utility in the country to announce a goal of delivering carbon-free
electricity.
The utility's latest announcement comes as Colorado continues to tighten regulations to cut emissions of
methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and pollutants from oil and gas, transportation and other activities
that have put a large portion of the Front Range out of compliance with federal air-quality standards.
The decision by Xcel also comes as the public and investors are pressuring the oil and gas industry and
energy suppliers to be more environmentally responsible. Companies' performance in ESG 
environmental, social and corporate governance  is being scrutinized along with revenue and free cash
flow.
Crestone is working with Project Canary, a Denver-based company, to deploy 24/7 monitoring of its oil
and gas sites in Weld, Arapahoe and Adams counties. Project Canary provides the monitoring
technology and works with the Payne Institute for Public Policy at the Colorado School of Mines, which
collects the data to provide an independent analysis of the information.
""We saw where the air quality standards and where the regulations were going and what was going to be
required of companies to operate in Colorado. As a leader in this space we wanted to continue to lead,""
said Jason Oates, Crestone's vice president of government affairs.
The intent is to produce ""some of the cleanest molecules"" anywhere, Oates said.
Jeremy Nichols, climate and energy program director for the environmental group WildEarth Guardians,
said continuous monitoring of emissions instead of just periodic inspections can provide a sense of
what's happening at well sites. The sites typically include multiple wells, tanks and other equipment.
However, Nichols voiced concern about efforts by companies to brand their oil and gas as responsibly
produced. Oil and natural gas emit greenhouse gases no matter how cleanly they're produced, he said.
""Reducing methane leaks, ensuring compliance with clean air rules and regulations, that's all well and
good,"" Nichols added. ""But ultimately, we need to find ways to transition, to learn to live without oil and
gas.""
Colorado's oil and gas regulations are considered among the strongest in the nation. The rules have
been revised through the years and in 2019 a state law mandated a sweeping overhaul of the
regulations, including earlier and more frequent monitoring of emissions.
In 2014, Colorado became the first state to approve methane regulations, which were used as a model
for the Obama administration's rules. The Trump administration rolled the rules back, but Congress is
considering reviving them.
Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a key focus in the battle against climate change. In the
short term, it is 84 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. The gas is released through
leaks or releases from equipment or produced when natural gas is burned as waste at oil wells.
""I think that it's beyond reasonable dispute that fossil fuels are going to be with us for the immediate
future. As we all move toward a cleaner economy, we need to understand that in this interim we need to
make sure that the fossil fuel supply chain is as clean as it can be,"" said Dan Grossman, senior director
of regulatory and legislative affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund.
Grossman said initiatives like Crestone's are positive and might be a good model, but voluntary
measures aren't a substitute for regulations.
""That's why it's so critical that the Biden administration moves quickly and boldly on methane regulations
and states like Colorado continually improve their own regulations,"" Grossman said.
Crestone has caught leaks and other problems much more quickly, thanks to its continuous monitoring,
said Taryn Weiner, the air quality supervisor for the company. She said the sensors have identified
seven incidents over 17 months that warranted action.
Justin Blohm, an environmental consultant, along with Crestone employees, gets all the alerts and
alarms. Some are due to maintenance work. Information about wind direction and other meteorological
data can help determine whether a spike in emissions is from the site or blowing in from somewhere
else.
During a demonstration at a Crestone well pad near Firestone, Blohm pointed out the small jump on his
computer screen after someone opened a propane bottle around a sensor.
""Those canaries sense every second of every day, and it's uploaded to the cloud once a minute,"" said
Canary Project co-founder and CEO Chris Romer, referring to the sensors.
Besides methane, the devices monitor volatile organic compounds, which include toluene and benzene,
known to cause cancer. The chemicals contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, or smog,
which can cause or aggravate respiratory problems. The sensors also monitor levels of particulate
matter, which causes hazy air.
Romer said Project Canary has its devices on more than 100 well pads in major oil and gas fields in
Texas, North Dakota and other states. The company works with operators through its TrustWell program
to certify that well construction meets certain standards and that operations haven't harmed the air, water
or surrounding communities.
A company that can show its natural gas or oil was produced responsibly will likely have a competitive
edge, said Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute. He pointed to a decision last year by Engie, a
French utility, to halt negotiations on a multi-billion-dollar deal to import liquified natural gas from the U.S.
Although Engie hasn't fully explained publicly why it scuttled the deal, Bazilian said he believes there
were political and environmental concerns, such as the impact of methane emissions. He said the gas
was called too dirty.
""I think that sent ripples through the industries: the operators, the people in the oil and gas industry as
well as the finance community,"" said Bazilian, formerly the lead energy specialist at the World Bank.
The Payne Institute is going through the initial phases of pulling together Crestone's data. The company
is working to have Project Canary recognized as a state-approved monitoring method so it can share its
data with regulators, Oates said.
""We know that natural gas and fossil fuels are slowly being replaced by other forms of energy, but we
need to have an organized and efficient transition. You want to use the cleanest forms (of energy) when
you're doing that,"" said John Schmidt, Crestone's vice president of operations. ""We want to basically be
the last spigot turned off when we're off fossil fuels.""

Under rules given preliminary approval Thursday, Colorado will be one of only two states to prohibit
companies from routinely venting and flaring natural gas from well sites.
The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission also gave initial approval to a rule requiring
companies and regulators to assess the cumulative impacts of oil and gas development locally and on a
broader scale. The COGCC and other state agencies will evaluate the ongoing effects on air and water
quality, greenhouse gas emissions and provide reports.
The rules, up for a final vote Nov. 20, are part of the implementation of Senate Bill 181, a 2019 law
mandating that oil and gas be regulated in a way that protects public health, safety and the environment.
The provisions on flaring and venting prohibit routine releases of natural gas from oil and gas equipment.
Alaska is the only other state that bans the releases, said Dan Grossman, the regional director of the
Environmental Defense Fund.
""The draft that you all are considering now would be among the strongest in the nation, with perhaps the
exception of Alaska, as far as flaring regulations go,"" Grossman said.
Flaring occurs when companies producing oil burn associated natural gas as waste, usually because
there are no pipelines to ship the natural gas to market or because it's uneconomical to ship it. Gas is
also flared during maintenance or for safety when the pipeline pressure rises.
Efforts to prevent the flaring and venting of natural gas from wells have taken on urgency as the impacts
of climate change have intensified. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse
gas and is 84 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over the short term.
Flaring and venting also emit nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds, which contribute to
ground-level ozone pollution.
""Having Colorado continue to serve as a model for eliminating that practice is just terrific. It's really
important for our climate goals because methane is a very serious climate pollutant,"" said Kelly Nordini,
(executive director of Conservation Colorado.
In 2014, Colorado approved the nation's first state-level methane regulations. A federal rule recently
rolled back by the Trump administration was modeled after Colorado's law, which was developed by
state and industry officials and environmentalists.
The average volume of natural gas vented and flared in Colorado is 24 times below the national average,
Dan Haley, president and CEO off the Colorado Oil and Gas Association said in an email.
""Colorado companies are committed to keeping product in the pipe, venting or flaring only 0.2 percent of
its natural gas in 2019,"" Haley said. ""Quite frankly, there was no evidence presented that demonstrates a
need for new venting and flaring rules, because it's incredibly rare in Colorado.""
It's a different picture nationally. The World Bank says four countries  Russia, Iran, Iraq and the U.S.
 are responsible for nearly half of the gas flaring worldwide. Flaring in the U.S. rose 48% from 2017 to
2018, according to the World Bank. Activity in North Dakota's Bakken oil and field and the Permian Basin

Colorado regulators require zeroemission devices for oil and.txt,"Colorado regulators require zero-emission devices for oil and gas

The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission on Thursday unanimously approved a rule requiring oil
and gas operators to install zero-emissions devices to new and existing operations.
Older pneumatic controllers rely on pressurized natural gas to open and close valves that regulate
temperature and pressure at production facilities and well sites. In the process, the devices can emit
methane and other pollutants.
Newer non-emitting devices, however, to reduce emissions are available to reduce leaks from methane,
one of the most potent greenhouse gases.
""This agreement among industry and conservation groups will allow for the thoughtful reduction of
emissions and the improvement of Colorado's air quality, adding to the significant emission cuts that
have taken place over the past few years,"" Dan Haley, president and CEO of the Colorado Oil and Gas
Association, said in a statement.
""The Colorado way is about putting differences aside and coming together to find solutions. We are
grateful to the Air Quality Control Commission for swiftly adopting this joint proposal and hope this serves
as a collaborative model from which all stakeholders can build upon in the future.""
The Environmental Defense Fund estimated that controllers across the country released more than
132,000 metric tons of methane in 2017, equivalent almost 1.9 million passenger vehicles.
The devices would help the state meet higher climate change standards set by Gov. Jared Polis and
Democratic allies in the legislature who adopted House Bill 1261 in 2019 and the Greenhouse Gas
Roadmap the governor's office released in January to reduce emissions by 60% by 2030.
Carbondale Trustee Erica Sparhawk, who is president of Colorado Communities for Climate Action,
linked last year's record wildfireseason to climate change as motivation to work together.
""This collaboration between local governments, environmental groups, and industry will mean less
carbon pollution and cleaner, safer air,"" said the leader of the coalition, which includes 36 local
governments. ""It is a win for Coloradans all over the state.""
The rule takes effect May 1 for new sites and by 2023 to retrofit existing facilities.
Lynn Granger, executive director of the American Petroleum Industry Colorado, said both sides wanted
to make ""real, lasting emission reductions for the people of Colorado"" and the negotiations were
""intensive and deeply substantive"" and credited good-faith collaboration.
""Our industry remains firmly committed to demonstrable environmental progress, and today is an
important milestone in that effort,"" she said.
Dan Grossman, Rocky Mountain Regional Director for Environmental Defense Fund, said the state
continues to lead nation in addressing methane emissions. The federal rule adopted by the Obama
administration was based on Colorado's program, and Grossman hoped Thursday's decision would do
that, as well.
""With broad support from industry and the environmental and public health community, the commission
is setting the standard for other states and the U.S. EPA to follow in addressing pollution from new and
existing sites using pneumatic devices,"" he said.
Sara Rose Tannenbaum, the climate advocate for Conservation Colorado, called the new rule a
common-sense precedent setter to cut methane emissions.

Colorado voters favor public land protection.txt,"Colorado voters favor public land protection
February 26, 2020  Estes Park Trail-Gazette (CO)

As Estes Park residents give their feedback on a proposed Open Space and Outdoor Recreation Plan
that could shape the future of land conservation in the Estes Valley, a study published last week found
Colorado voters overwhelmingly support public land conservation.
The Colorado College State of the Rockies Project published its 10th annual ""Conversation in the West""
poll on Feb. 20, and the results show a growing concern among Colorado voters about the impacts of
climate change and energy development on public lands.
The poll surveyed the views of voters in eight mountain West states (Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming).
The results reflect a shared expectation among Colorado voters for their elected officials to advance
policies reflecting land conservation in the region.
""Support for conservation on public lands has remained consistent and strong over the decade-long
history of our poll,"" said Corina McKendry, director of the State of the Rockies Project and associate
professor of political science at Colorado College. ""The urgency and demand for action behind those
feelings is now intensifying as voters in Colorado and across the West increasingly believe their lands
and lifestyles are coming under attack from the impacts of climate change and energy development.""
The poll showed that Colorado voters place climate change as the second-greatest environmental threat
facing the state. This belief has increased over the ten years the poll has been conducted, up from 6% of
voters in 2011 to 33% today.
The vast majority of voters in Colorado value safe and protected public lands, the poll shows. Over 70%
of voters believe mining has negative impacts on land and water and that the impacts of oil and gas
drilling are a significant problem for the environment.
Water protection is another key priority for Colorado voters, the poll shows. Colorado's semi-arid climate
means that a greater quantity of water is necessary to sustain agriculture than in many other states,
according to Colorado State University.
It's not surprising then that water conservation is among the top environmental concerns of Colorado
voters, according to the poll.
Protecting wildlife was also a high priority for Colorado voters, the poll shows. Nearly 80% of voters said
they support policies that close off public lands where wildlife migrates each year to oil and gas drilling.
Researchers have long looked into the impact that exposure to nature has on one's health and wellbeing. Recent studies show just how much that exposure impacts one's health, particularly as it relates
to stress.
""The advantages of grass and landscaping surpass the usual physical benefits that result from outdoor
activity,"" said Kris Kiser, president and CEO, Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI), a trade
association that represents manufacturers and suppliers of outdoor power equipment. ""Numerous
studies have found that people who spend more time outside or are exposed to living landscapes are
happier, healthier and smarter. As you get ready to get outside this spring with your lawnmower and
other outdoor power equipment, it's great to know being outside is good for you.""
According to Dr. Christopher Lowry, neuroscientist at the University of Bristol in England, getting dirty in
soil is good for one's health. That's because a micro bacteria in soil stimulates serotonin production in the
brain, leading to a boost in mood.
Research also shows that children raised in a ""dirtier"" environment often have stronger immune systems
and can manage stress better than their peers who weren't raised in a similar environment, according to
the National Academy of Sciences.
The Estes Valley Land Trust, in coordination with several local groups, is currently conducting a
community-wide survey to gauge the environmental priorities of residents in the Estes Valley to help
shape its proposed Open Space and Outdoor Recreation Plan.
The survey, which can be completed online or in person, was released on Feb. 13 and is open until April
The plan, according to the land trust's website, is to ""provide a unified vision, priority land conservation
areas, and strategies.""
Answers to the survey will be used to understand the types of land that should be preserved in the Estes
Valley in the future.
Results of the survey are set to be shared this summer at a public cookout hosted by the Estes Valley
Land Trust.

Snow and wintry weather in Colorado have aided firefighters battling the two biggest wildfires in Colorado

The East Troublesome fire, the second-largest fire in state history burning just north of Granby and into
Rocky Mountain National Park, has burned 192,560 acres, almost 301 square miles, and is 15%
contained.
Both wildfires, hit Sunday and overnight by snow and frigidly cold weather, resulted in no fire growth on
Monday and that the moisture will likely calm the fires for at least a couple days and perhaps into next
week, fire officials said.
At a Monday evening briefing on the East Troublesome fire, Noel Livingston, the fire incident
commander, said he drove around fire areas during the day and ""saw no active fire.""
There was some smoldering, but little to no fire, Livingston said.
""From a firefighting perspective, it was a day of rest,"" he said.
Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin said at the Monday evening briefing that structure assessment
teams worked on Monday, but there was some difficulty getting back into some areas because of the
snow.
Schroetlin didn't release any new numbers on homes destroyed. He did say officials hope to notify about
90% of the property owners who have lost a home about the loss by the end of the week.
""Right now there is no accurate number we feel comfortable releasing,"" Schroetlin said.
The sheriff said deputies on Monday were occupied by people who are circumventing neighborhood
checkpoints and taking photos of destroyed homes and posting such photos on social media.
""Unacceptable,"" Schroetlin said of the development. ""Our community deserves respect and to be treated
correctly.""
Lower elevations of the East Troublesome fire received abut 6 inches of snow Sunday into Monday
morning and higher elevations received about a foot of much-needed snow, Livingston said.
""We are really happy to see the snow and we are going to take advantage of it,"" he said.
On Sunday and Monday, many firefighters were able to catch a much-needed rest. Fire engines have a
hard time traveling back roads that are snow packed and temperatures in the single digits and teens
impacted firefighters efforts and raised safety concerns.
Primary focus on the East Troublesome fire on Monday will be to ""get people back into their homes,""
Livingston said.
The fire's ""footprint"" is not expected to grow in the short term, but ""it is not going to put the fire out"" in the
short run, Livingston said.
As October gives way to November and more wintry weather arises, ""Mother Nature is going to put this
fire out,"" Livingston said.
On the Cameron Peak fire, up to 2 feet of snow fell in some areas, said operations section chief Paul
Delmerico at a Monday morning briefing.
It snowed across the entire fire area, ""which is a huge plus for all of the firefighters who have been
engaged for the past 76 days,"" Delmerico said.
The snowstorm limited the fire Sunday and overnight, with no growth of the massive perimeter. Fire
officials expect little to no growth on Monday.
Wind chills, frigid weather and road conditions are a concern for firefighters. Fire crews will monitor the
fire and work in areas ""where access is safe,"" according to a morning update.
""Precipitation received over the fire the past two days will significantly diminish fire behavior in the short
term but may not be enough to end fire season for the year,"" fire officials said.
Monday's weather will remain very cold, below freezing, with frigid temperatures overnight, but the
extended forecast calls for a drying trend with seasonal temperatures, above freezing, during the day,
and no precipitation.
For now, in the aftermath of the snowstorm, ""I do think we are in a very good spot,"" Delmerico
said.Wildfire map

FRISCO  A blanket of snow helped to calm wildfires burning across almost a half-million acres
throughout the state this weekend, providing much needed relief for firefighters and communities rallying
to push back against perhaps the most severe wildfireseason in Colorado history.
The reprieve is long overdue. Unseasonably warm and dry conditions throughout the summer and fall
shined a bright light on the ever-lengthening wildfireseason in Colorado. And officials say it might not be
over yet.
As firefighters continue working to douse the still-smoldering forests, fire managers around the state are
crossing their fingers that there are no more ignitions with another week of dry conditions in the forecast.
While Colorado has seen its fair share of destructive wildfires in the past, experts say the magnitude,
locations and timing of the fires this year might be pointing to something more alarming: that megafires in
Colorado are no longer a novel occurrence and that residents need to be prepared for the worst.
""This wildfireseason should be a wake-up call to anyone who lives in the wildland-urban interface,"" said
Phillip Daniels, deputy chief of Colorado's Wildland Fire Management Section. ""If you're in an area where
there are trees near homes and trees near businesses in close proximity, you need to be aware of the
danger that is out there. 
""We've been building to this point to where it's a common occurrence to have a fire where you lose not
one or 10 homes but 100 or 1,000. It's bringing what we've been talking about for 30 years right into
people's living rooms. This is no longer theory. This is no longer what these crazy wildland folks are
talking about. This is a real, exigent problem.""
The age of megafires
In 2002, Colorado residents looked on as the Hayman Fire burned more than 138,000 acres across
Douglas, Jefferson, Park and Teller counties, consuming hundreds of structures and forcing thousands
to evacuate.
For some residents, the Hayman Fire might have seemed like an anomaly. At the time, it was the only
wildfire in Colorado's history to hit 100,000 acres, the mark typically used to define a megafire. Prior to
2002, the state had never seen another recorded blaze surpass even 30,000 acres.
But over the past two decades, the state has seen wildfires become more severe as Coloradans
continue to reckon with the impacts of climate change, heavy fuel loads and a lack of forest diversity.
This year alone, Colorado saw its three largest wildfires  the Cameron Peak Fire (208,000 acres), the
East Troublesome Fire (192,560) and the Pine Gulch Fire (139,007), two of which are still burning.
And experts say residents and fire managers need to be prepared for more big fires down the road.
""What we need to realize is that with our current situation with climate change, these are going to be the
new types of fire seasons we see in the future,"" said Julie Korb, professor of biology at Fort Lewis
College. ""With the climate-change-induced droughts we're seeing, we can expect to see wildfires starting
as early as April. And as we've seen this year, our fires aren't going to be out until November.""
Korb pointed to the East Troublesome Fire as a prime example of the potential dangers facing mountain
communities. She said climate-change-induced droughts  warmer weather combined with a lack of
precipitation  is one of the main problems leading to the potential for massive fires at higher elevations.
Historically, higher elevation forests were buffered from extreme wildfires by cooler temperatures and
precipitation that allowed for slower drying of fuel sources. But the East Troublesome Fire shows that
mountain communities are not immune.
""These forests evolve with stand-replacing fires, so having fires crowning out is normal for higher
elevation forests,"" Korb said. ""What is not normal is having those fires occur this late in the year. And it's
not only that it made a 100,000-acre run in a 24-hour period, it's when it did it. Basic fire science says
temperatures go down and relative humidity goes up at night, which allows our lower-level fuels to retain
some moisture.
""What we're seeing is that it wasn't behaving as normal wildfires do. It actually exploded in the middle of
the night and not only at lower elevations. It was going over the Alpine tundra above 12,000 feet.  We
can definitely say that in the past 100 years, this is very novel. I don't think anyone would have predicted
that run this late in the season, particularly in the middle of the night. We're seeing things that we haven't
even fathomed.""
Korb noted that many scientists felt that the arrival of commonplace megafires in Colorado was only a
matter of time but that most people didn't expect a season like 2020 for at least another three to five
years. Much of Colorado is already in an extreme drought and many areas of the Western Slope 
including portions of Summit and Grand counties  are currently in an exceptional drought, according to
the U.S. Drought Monitor. Korb said that without good snowfall this winter, the state might again be facing
a rough outlook next year.
Turning the dial back on climate change will be a lengthy and involved process. But some are hopeful the
large fires across Colorado will help some problems, like heavy fuel loads and a lack of forest diversity,
self-correct.
""The trees that mostly burned during the last couple months here in Colorado are all about the same
age,"" Daniels said. "" We've been actively suppressing fires since around 1870. So I think we are going
to see more of these fires. But once the newer growth of lodgepole and spruce comes in, there's a pretty
good chance that, for a while, we won't be impacted by these 100,000-acre fires.""
Preparing for the future
Wildfires are healthy for forests, and as Daniels noted, this fire season should help to reduce fuel loads
and increase forest diversity in some areas around the state. But the season also resulted in lives lost,
hundreds of homes destroyed and expensive suppression costs. And with the ongoing impacts of
climate change still posing a threat for more severe wildfires in coming years, officials say Coloradans
have to take action.
""I think it's the new norm, and it's something those of us in the Western U.S. need to get used to,"" said
Jeff Berino, former chief at Summit Fire & EMS and fire science instructor at Colorado Mountain College.
""The answer is to create fire-adapted communities. We need to learn to live with fire and to adjust to it.""
Experts agree that the best solution for combatting future forest fires is to take a collaborative approach
to creating fire-wise communities, a process that requires participation from everyone from individual
residents to federal agencies.
It starts with individual homeowners, who should be taking the coming months to make sure their homes
are safe by mitigating fire risks on their own properties. But county, state and federal agencies also need
to do their part to complete more widespread fuels-mitigation projects, prescribed burns and firebreaks
capable of serving as speed bumps for wildfires near towns and residential areas.
""We can start local and work our way out,"" Korb said. ""But we also have to realize these fuels are all
connected. The East Troublesome Fire started by Grand Lake and moved to Estes Park. We're all
connected, so we can't just say 'our community is good.' We need to make sure we're managing our
landscapes on a broad scale.""
Fire managers are also calling on officials to make better use of fire restrictions to avoid confusion
among visitors, and urged residents and visitors to better adhere to those restrictions when they're in
place.
As some experts predict more severe wildfires in the coming years, there might also be a need for more
firefighting resources to help keep communities safe.
""Probably the most concerning thing to me as a chief of eight years is that over these last few weeks, we
have stretched and strained and taken chances to help our partners,"" said Jim Keating, chief at the Red,
White & Blue Fire Protection District in Breckenridge. ""When the East Troublesome Fire blew up, nearly
every department in the mountain region really stretched and kept a bare minimum in their district. At the
same time, we took an inventory of available resources that could be here within 30 or 45 minutes, and
there was nothing. So we knew if a fire broke outhere, we had to deal with it with the resources we had.
""The biggest thing, with so many of these fires on federal forests, is upping the abilities of the Forest
Service to provide better resources as necessary. That one component is where the most benefit will
come from. There's only so much we can do to prepare locally.""
For officials, the biggest takeaway from the 2020 wildfireseason is that community members shouldn't
forget about it or take for granted that things will improve dramatically in the future.
""The message is that we can't let our guard down, and we cannot get complacent and think that our
altitude will save us,"" Berino said. ""We've made huge strides here in Summit County, but this is an
annual event and we have to learn and live with wildfires moving forward.""

The Pine Gulch fire - Colorado's first blaze this season when it ignited July 31 - and three other major fires showed no signs of slowing Monday as hot, dry and windy weather fueled flames across hundreds of thousands of acres of timber, brush, and grass, according to the Incident Information System website.
The Grizzly Creek fire reached 27,000 acres Monday and remains the state's top wildfire priority because of the threat it poses to structures. The blaze caused the closure of a 24-mile stretch Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon, between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum, that began Aug. 10.
RELAT ED:
Williams Fork fire is human-caused, officials-say
Check statewide road conditions from Colorado Department of Transportation here.
Hot and dry conditions, along with winds from the northeast are expected to continue. Fire crews plan to bolster efforts by using heavy equipment in each area of the fire to construct a perimeter.
""Weather for the next two days is a concern,"" officials said on the incident page.
Firefighters are protecting structures primarily in No Name and Bair Ranch areas, as well as High Aspen, Spring Valley and other southern areas, which are all near the fire 's eastern perimeter.
Crews began prepping buildings and structures Monday along the No Name creek, where firefighters are also prepared for ""any spot fires that cross the creek,"" the incident report said.
Crews on the east side of the fire will work to complete indirect fire line construction from I-70 to the Coffee Pot Road.
A private cabin and two small outbuildings have been destroyed by flames, Mary Cernicek, spokeswoman for the Grizzly Creek fire , said.
The fire crossed I-70 in spots through Glenwood Canyon in recent days, causing large boulders and logs to fall off the hillside. The steep terrain makes it difficult for firefighters to move freely along the corridor, Cernicek said. In total, 647 firefighters are working to contain the fire.
Containment remains at zero. The Grizzly Creek fire's cause is unknown.
The Williams Fork fire, the state's second-highest priority wildfire, erupted Friday and measures 6,645 acres in an area 15 miles southeast of Fraser in Grand County, according to the incident website. That fire is roaring through remote areas that experienced extensive beetle kill in the early 2000s. No evacuations have been issued.
Firefighters haven't reached any level of containment as of Monday but were able to somewhat control the flames Sunday afternoon thanks to a shift in winds and fire retardant dropped from air resources, officials said. The fire has been ruled as started by human activity.
The Pine Gulch fire, north of Grand Junction, grew to 87,209 acres as of late Monday, according to the incident website - a size approaching that of Colorado's fourth-largest fire , the High Park fire , which burned 87,250 acres west of Fort Collins in 2012.
The fire can be seen from Glenwood Springs because flames are ""hung up"" in the Book Cliffs, Pat Seekins, Operations Section Chief Rocky Mountain Incident Team Type 1, said during a community briefing Monday. This southeastern area of the fire has been the most active over the past few days. It's moving rapidly and producing a lot of smoke. A total of 826 personnel are assigned to the fire and have a primary focus to keep it controlled in that area, Seekins explained.
Flames of the fire's south area continued across rugged and steep terrain Monday, which has been inaccessible for crews.
""It's a tough piece of ground to get firefighters into,"" said Seekins.
Crews have identified road systems in the north and west sides of the fire that aid in developing fire containment lines.
""Homes have been protected the past five to six days. Its been going really well,"" Seekins said.
The Pine Gulch fire, ignited by lightning, remains at 7% containment.
A fourth fire , the Cameron Peak fire , is burning in the Arapaho and Roosevelt national forests near Cameron Pass and Chambers Lake west of Fort Collins.
The fire that started Aug. 13 surpassed 14,018 acres and like the other three fires, is intensified by the heat and dryness. CO-14 is closed between Walden and Rustic because of the Cameron Peak
fire. No structures have been burned.
The fire's cause is unknown.

FRISCO -- A blanket of snow helped to calm wildfires burning across almost a half-million acres throughout the state this weekend, providing much needed relief for firefighters and communities rallying to push back against perhaps the most severe wildfireseason in Colorado history.
The reprieve is long overdue. Unseasonably warm and dry conditions throughout the summer and fall shined a bright light on the ever-lengthening wildfireseason in Colorado. And officials say it might not be over yet.
As firefighters continue working to douse the still-smoldering forests, fire managers around the state are crossing their fingers that there are no more ignitions with another week of dry conditions in the forecast.
While Colorado has seen its fair share of destructive wildfires in the past, experts say the magnitude, locations and timing of the fires this year might be pointing to something more alarming: that megafires in Colorado are no longer a novel occurrence and that residents need to be prepared for the worst.
""This wildfireseason should be a wake-up call to anyone who lives in the wildland-urban interface,"" said Phillip Daniels, deputy chief of Colorado's Wildland Fire Management Section. ""If you're in an area where there are trees near homes and trees near businesses in close proximity, you need to be aware of the danger that is out there. ...
""We've been building to this point to where it's a common occurrence to have a fire where you lose not one or 10 homes but 100 or 1,000. It's bringing what we've been talking about for 30 years right into people's living rooms. This is no longer theory. This is no longer what these crazy wildland folks are talking about. This is a real, exigent problem.""
The age of megafires
In 2002, Colorado residents looked on as the Hayman Fire burned more than 138,000 acres across Douglas, Jefferson, Park and T eller counties, consuming hundreds of structures and forcing thousands to evacuate.
For some residents, the Hayman Fire might have seemed like an anomaly. At the time, it was the only wildfire in Colorado's history to hit 100,000 acres, the mark typically used to define a megafire. Prior to 2002, the state had never seen another recorded blaze surpass even 30,000 acres.
But over the past two decades, the state has seen wildfires become more severe as Coloradans continue to reckon with the impacts of climate change, heavy fuel loads and a lack of forest diversity. This year alone, Colorado saw its three largest wildfires: the Cameron Peak Fire (208,000), the East Troublesome Fire (192,560) and the Pine Gulch Fire (139,007), two of which are still burning late into October.
And experts say residents and fire managers need to be prepared for more big fires down the road.
""What we need to realize is that with our current situation with climate change, these are going to be the new types of fire seasons we see in the future,"" said Julie Korb, professor of biology at Fort Lewis College. ""With the climate-change-induced droughts we're seeing, we can expect to see wildfires starting as early as April. And as we've seen this year, our fires aren't going to be out until November.""
Korb pointed to the East Troublesome Fire in Grand County as a prime example of the potential dangers facing mountain communities. She said climate-change-induced droughts -- warmer weather combined with a lack of precipitation -- is one of the main problems leading to the potential for massive fires at higher elevations.
Historically, higher elevation forests were buffered from extreme wildfires by cooler temperatures and precipitation that allowed for slower drying of fuel sources. But the East Troublesome Fire shows that mountain communities are not immune.
""These forests evolve with stand-replacing fires, so having fires crowning out is normal for higher elevation forests,"" Korb said. ""What is not normal is having those fires occur this late in the year. And it's not only that it made a 100,000-acre run in a 24-hour period, it's when it did it. Basic fire science says temperatures go down and relative humidity goes up at night, which allows our lowerlevel fuels to retain some moisture.
""What we're seeing is that it wasn't behaving as normal wildfires do. It actually exploded in the middle of the night and not only at lower elevations. It was going over the Alpine tundra above 12,000 feet. ... We can definitely say that in the past 100 years, this is very novel. I don't think anyone would have predicted that run this late in the season, particularly in the middle of the night. We're seeing things that we haven't even fathomed.""
Korb noted that many scientists felt that the arrival of commonplace megafires in Colorado was only a matter of time but that most people didn't expect a season like 2020 for at least another three to five years. Much of Colorado is already in an extreme drought and many areas of the Western Slope -- including portions of Summit and Grand counties -- are currently in an exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Korb said that without good snowfall this winter, the state might again be facing a rough outlook next year.
T urning the dial back on climate change will be a lengthy and involved process. But some are hopeful the large fires across Colorado will help some problems, like heavy fuel loads and a lack of forest diversity, self-correct.
""The trees that mostly burned during the last couple months here in Colorado are all about the same age,"" Daniels said. ""... We've been actively suppressing fires since around 1870. So I think we are going to see more of these fires. But once the newer growth of lodgepole and spruce comes in, there's a pretty good chance that, for a while, we won't be impacted by these 100,000-acre fires.""

Wildfires are healthy for forests, and as Daniels noted, this fire season should help to reduce fuel loads and increase forest diversity in some areas around the state. But the season also resulted in lives lost, hundreds of homes destroyed and expensive suppression costs. And with the ongoing impacts of climate change still posing a threat for more severe wildfires in coming years, officials say Coloradans have to take action.

Pests began their devastating march through forests some 15 years ago
Colorado's forests have been waging a losing battle against tree-killing beetles for more than 15 years. Now, after marching across the state and killing millions of acres of pine forest , the burrowing, fungus-spreading mountain pine beetles are slowly losing steam.
While other beetles have thrived in Colorado's drought-ravaged mountains, the mountain pine beetles have reigned as the state's most nefarious pest. But the mountain pine beetle epidemic was always going to end, as there are only so many ponderosa and lodgepole trees in the 3.3 million acres affected by the tree-killing insects in Colorado.
And with that decline, a timber industry that has thrived on a once seemingly endless flow of dead pine trees is transitioning to new types of timber and logging.
This also means the end is near for the coveted blue-stained wood the pests leave behind. They spread a fungus in trees, leaving a distinctive blue hue that has made beetle-kill lodgepole a highvalue wood for cabinetry, paneling and trim work.
David Sitton's Aspen Wall Wood mill in Dolores transitioned from pure aspen paneling to mostly beetle kill almost 20 years ago. Now he's preparing to transition back.
""That blue stain, it will be a relic at some point,"" said Sitton, who bought the Aspen Wall Wood mill in 2016.
'Compounding disturbances'
The march of mountain pine beetles through Colorado's forests changed the composition of the state's woodlands. Aspen, spruce and Douglas fir have thrived in areas where beetle kill lodgepole was harvested by loggers who supported sawmills like Sitton's. It's not likely the state will see a resurgence of lodgepole anytime soon.
A lodgepole pine typically begins dropping cones to seed a new generation of trees after about 15 years of growth. The Cameron Peak and East Troublesome wildfires last fall scorched hundreds of thousands of acres of roughly 15-year-old lodgepole, just as the young trees were ready to begin reproducing .
That's what scientists call ""compounding disturbances.""
""Those fires , that was a double whammy for lodgepole,"" said Brett Wolk, the assistant director of Colorado State University's Colorado Forest Restoration Institute. ""It's not an extinct species, but the decline in lodgepole is accelerating the change in our forests. It's just another indication of climate change and compounding disturbances and how things are happening quicker than we
ever anticipated. Everything is changing a lot faster.""
A sawmill's proximity to an outbreak largely determines the profitability of logging, transporting and milling the salvaged trees.
The longer a dead lodgepole or spruce stands unharvested, the less viable it becomes for lumber. After a decade or so, the standing dead trees start to rot, making them likely to break when they are logged, de-limbed, loaded onto trucks or processed at sawmills. A lodgepole can last longer, but spruce tends to spiral crack after several years, making it useless for timber.
The breakage makes salvaged timber less valuable, as logging companies and timber mills get less usable wood per acre. But new acres are being impacted by a host of insects that flourish in drought conditions.
""I'm not sure we will ever run out of beetle kill, really,"" said Molly Pitts, the executive director of the Colorado T imber Association, which has 56 members including loggers, sawmills, truckers and other companies. ""We just won't see it in that volume we had before.""
Some sawmills are phasing out mountain pine beetle-kill production and transitioning to more live trees. But there are a few years of other beetle kill left. The spruce beetle is continuing its more constrained but still deleterious sweep across southern Colorado. Spruce beetles have killed roughly 1.9 million acres of trees since 2000, impacting about 41% of the state's spruce and fir forests. But the number of trees killed by the spruce beetle in Colorado has been declining for the past five years. The damage is still evident, though. Engelmann spruce trees in the Rio Grande and San Juan national forests  fighting through a sustained, 20-year drought  are under attack by spruce beetles, making the insect a top priority for state and federal forest guardians. The spruce beetle affected 25,000 new acres of Engelmann in Colorado in 2019. And in recent years, the roundheaded pine beetle has been attacking the region's ponderosa pines, impacting 22,000 acres in 2019.
The exceptionally dry winter will likely spike beetle kill in southern Colorado this summer, Pitts said.
""We anticipate quite an uptick in beetle outbreaks down there,"" she said.
The Montrose Forest Products sawmill in 2018 announced a $21 million upgrade so it could process as much as 20 million more board feet a year of ponderosa pine from the San Juan National Forest . The sawmill, which has traditionally produced studs, beams and structural lumber for framing houses, is moving away from beetle kill.
The beetle-kill lodgepole from north of Interstate 70, as well as dead spruce in the Rio Grande and Gunnison national forests, ""is just not economical anymore,"" said T im Kyllo, the resource forester for Montrose Forest Products, noting his mill's distance from impacted forests as well as increasingly fragility of long-dead trees.
The state has moved from the epidemic stage of beetle infestation  where large numbers of trees were being killed across pretty much the entire state  to an endemic stage, where the pests are still killing, but at a slower rate and in smaller geographic areas.
The Montrose sawmill is expanding into harvesting and processing green timber off federal land. The mill's $21 million, 2-year-old planer can cut up to 44 million board feet of logs every year. In the past decade, almost all those trees would be beetle-kill Engelmann spruce, lodgepole and subalpine fir, all cut into structural boards. The new planer will cut more ponderosa pine  harvested live, not salvaged  into 1-inch boards for nonstructural uses like trim, cabinets and decking .
""We knew there would be a shelf life for dead timber. Had the beetle continued moving in the epidemic stage, we would still be involved in that salvage work, but now there's nothing in it,"" said Kyllo, who has five logging crews working in San Juan, Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, Gunnison and Rio Grande national forests, all but one harvesting live trees.
Impacts on the timber industry
Beetle-ravaged trees fed an industry that is slowing and adjusting business plans as the beetles wane.
The Forest Service is focused on foresthealth, and thinning forests is a critical tool in lessening the severity and spread of wildfire while increasing the diversity of tree species. Most logging in Colorado is done on federal land, so the state's timber industry relies largely on federal logging contracts and timber sales to operate. Those contracts ebb and flow in changing political climates. In other areas of the country, like the South, timber is harvested from private land in fertile areas where trees grow faster.
So as lumber prices explode this year under record demand for new homes and a pandemicslashed labor pool, it makes more sense to build new sawmills  or open dormant mills  down South.
""It can be risky to build a new facility in Colorado,"" Kyllo said.
""There may be a desire to expand right now ... but capital investment in mills is expensive and you are not going to build a new sawmill based on what is being offered in this state,"" the timber association's Pitts said.
The Forest Service's aggressive clear-cutting of beetle kill, in addition to burning and thinning forests to slow the pests, has reduced the flow of blue-stained wood, but Dolores sawmill owner Sitton still expects five, maybe even 10 more years of supply. If he had to transport beetle-kill across the state, though, he would be cutting the blue stain from Aspen Wall Wood's offerings. (The spruce and round-headed beetles do not leave spruce stained blue like lodgepole killed by mountain pine beetles.)
When he cuts trees into 1-inch boards, he creates a decent amount of waste, usually 20% to 30% of the tree.
""Being righthere, so close to the trees, we can afford that waste factor. We could not if we had to add freight to the equation,"" he said.
The beetle epidemic has been calamitous for Colorado's forests, but Sitton sees an upside, beyond his ability to expand his business on the dead timber.
""It's devastating to see the impacts of the beetles, but the flip side is that they have put more focus on foresthealth,"" he said. ""So there is a silver lining in there. And a blue one, too, I guess, right?""

The dozens of people in Colorado prisons who fight wildfires are largely locked out of the firefighting sector once they get out, but a new state law promises to change that.
The law, passed overwhelmingly by the state legislature and signed Thursday by Gov. Jared Polis, encourages the state Division of Fire Prevention and Control to give hiring preference to formerly incarcerated people with firefighting experience.
It also requires that the Department of Corrections educate prison firefighters about post-release employment in the field and establishes a peer mentorship program for those firefighters. These changes must be implemented by July 2022.
""Making it possible for these individuals to use their skills and training to find work once they are released helps increase public safety and reduce their chances of committing another crime and coming back into our custody,"" Department of Corrections Director Dean Williams said. ""When people have a job, a place to live, community connections and a larger purpose once they are released, they are much more likely to be contributing members of society. There is dignity in work and being productive again.""
Men who fought fires while incarcerated in Colorado are barred from working for urban fire departments because their felony convictions preclude them from getting EMT licenses. This new law won't change that. And while they have been not formally banned from many wildland firefighting departments, stigma and lack of awareness of employment opportunities have kept them from getting jobs with rare exceptions.
One of the sponsors of the new law, Rep. Dylan Roberts, said in a recent speech on the Colorado House floor that the bill is a win for the prisoners and for the public.
""We better equip our state to fire forest fires that we all know are increasing at an alarming rate, and we offer formerly incarcerated individuals a path back into our communities with a solid employment opportunity,"" the Avon Democrat said.
The inmate firefighting program has been suspended due to COVID-19, but pre-pandemic there were about 75 people participating among three different teams in Caon City, Buena Vista and Rifle. They are all men, convicted of non-violent offenses and eligible for parole within three years.
Hundreds apply annually, in part because they receive one day off their sentences for each day they are in the field. The incarcerated firefighters also earn about $6 per day of labor -- a relatively large figure compared to wages for other jobs in prison.

That means counties and national forests will inevitably impose fire bans to reduce the risk of wildfires. In 2020, record blazes burned 667,000 acres statewide as a result of the worsening climate issues producing ""megafires.""

The recent explosion of wildfires in Colorado and Wyoming, including the largest fire in Colorado history, has forced the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests to temporarily close all national forest land in Clear Creek, Jefferson, Gilpin, Boulder, and Larimer counties, according to a release from the U.S. Forest Service.
Extreme drought conditions, dried-out terrain, and fire -conducive weather all factored into the decision the close the land areas to all visitors, the forest service said.
Wildfires have torched nearly 700 square miles of land in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming, and weather forecasts show no immediate signs of precipitation or moisture that could aid in firefighting efforts, according to the release.
""The number of large fires and extreme fire behavior we are seeing in our forests this year is historic,"" said Forest Supervisor Monte Williams. ""These temporary closures are necessary to protect the public and out firefighters.""
The forest service said the closures will remain in effect until conditions improve.
Fierce winds pushed the Cameron Peak fire across arid terrain Tuesday morning and forced fire crews to retreat, according to InciWeb, an official fire information website.
Firefighters lost more than 10% in fire containment despite a massive inter-agency effort, officials said. The fire was 51% contained Tuesday and had scorched 205,004 acres.
More than 1,540 people worked to stop its spread as the flames torched dry beetle-killed lodgepole pine and grasses in the Roosevelt National Forest west of Fort Collins.
As crews pulled back from the south side of the fire between The Retreat and Storm Peak, they turned on pumps and sprinklers to try and protect structures.
On Monday, crews tried to prevent the fire from spreading eastward and used helicopters to suppress the blaze by dropping thousands of gallons of retardant, Paul Delmerico, operations section chief of the Cameron Peak fire , said.
""We ran those from sun up to sun down yesterday and that was largely effective,"" Delmerico said.
West of the Cameron Peak fire, another wildfire known as the East Troublesome consumed 15,546 acres since igniting Wednesday.
The fire, which is burning in terrain similar to the Cameron Peak fire, was 10% contained as of Tuesday morning and 293 firefighters worked to build containment lines with the help of dozers and air support, officials said.
Pre-evacuation orders for the Big Horn Park subdivision were issued Monday.
Farther south, two fires burned outside Boulder, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes in Jamestown and Ward.
The CalWood fire, which started Saturday, is up to 9,106 acres and is 17% contained with the help of aerial equipment, engines and ground crews, officials said..
The fire damaged 26 homes, among which 22 were obliterated, the Boulder Office of Emergency Management reported.
Approximately $75,000 was raised by a community fund for relief efforts for the CalWood fire and the Lefthand Canyon fire , also burning outside Boulder, according to a tweet from the Boulder ag ency.
The Lefthand Canyon fire was 320 acres and at 4% containment as of Tuesday morning, according to InciWeb.
Winds near both fires reached a blustery 45 mph Monday night, threatening to grow the flames, officials said.
A fifth fire erupted Monday west of Silverton near the Ice Lakes Trailhead in the San Juan National Forest , according to a Forest Service news release.
The Ice fire, which burned in heavy conifer timber, forced about 18 hikers to be airlifted from a 9 mile-long trail.
The blaze was 320 acres with no containment reported as of Monday.
The Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control is urging Colorado residents to assist firefighting efforts by being even more careful than usual.
""Exercise caution, follow directives from state and local officials, help protect our fellow residents, natural resources, and our wildland firefighters during this elevated fire threat."" said agency director Mike Morgan.
Suggested precautions include avoiding driving through tall grass, ensuring safety chains are secured while towing to avoid any sparks, and making sure all campfires are completely out before leaving a campground.
""If your campfire is too hot to touch, it's too hot to leave,"" officials warned.

DENVER (KDVR) -- The Colorado State Forest Service has released a new report that states more needs to be done to protect the health of the 14 million acres of forests.
The report comes after one of Colorado's worst years for wildfires ever. In 2020, the three largest fires in the state's history exploded and burned more than 600,000 acres.
""Our forests are not in good shape,"" said State Forester Mike Lester. ""We've got 20 years of significant insect issues. We've had drought issues the last couple years. Climate change has not been really good to our forests. It's really kicked up the insect disease cycle.""
The spruce beetle is the main culprit. Warmer winters haven't been killing the beetles, so they've been killing more trees, making them more susceptible to fires .
Another issue is that Colorado's forests are overcrowded.
""Normally fire would take care of that. Harvesting would take care of that, but we haven't really been doing that,"" Lester said.
Now the Forest Service is working with its federal and local partners to thin more forests more often.

As climate warming clobbers the West, Colorado officials facing rising costs from wildfires, shrinking water supplies and worsening air pollution are embracing the shift from the T rump administration to a Biden team they see as more aligned with state environmental priorities.
The state officials overseeing efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, conserve natural landscapes and beat rising heat in Colorado anticipate better opportunities for federal help under Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.
And they're preparing for teamwork with the Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service and the departments of Energy, Transportation and Agriculture, among other federal agencies, to move beyond planning to aggressive action on challenges from saving dying forests to cutting vehicle emissions.
""It's going to be a 180-degree shift,"" Colorado Energy Office director Will Toor said in a video call with state agency chiefs. ""The T rump administration has been probably the most antienvironmental administration in history. Certainly when it comes to addressing the challenges of climate change, they've done a surgical attack on virtually every federal policy that would support climate action ... making it harder to act at the state level.
""Having an administration that will have a proactive climate policy and respect climate science will make an impact at the national and international level but will really help support state-level innovation and action,"" Toor said, urging tougher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, funding for battery-charging stations and new tax incentives for drivers to switch to electric cars.
Biden's pledge to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and an expected push to contain warming sync with efforts under Democratic Gov. Jared Polis to reduce heat-trapping pollution within Colorado by closing coal-fired power plants and increasing regulation of the fossil fuel industry.
Colorado ranks among the leading oil-and-gas producer states, exporting fossil fuels that when burned elsewhere accelerate climate warming. Biden has called for a $2 trillion stimulus investment to hasten a shift to clean energy and create jobs -- funds that Colorado officials planned to tap.
Biden also has promised reversals of T rump rollbacks of environmental regulations for protecting air, land and water.
If Congress doesn't collaborate, Biden has indicated he'll wield executive power where possible to act unilaterally, which may reduce oil and gas drilling on Western public lands.
And Biden transition officials are reviewing proposals that would advance climate action Colorado officials have begun to consider. For example, they're mulling creation of a ""carbon bank"" run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that would pay farmers who adopt no-till methods and store
more carbon in soil -- helping a draw-down of heat-trapping air pollution that causes climate warming .
""We face persistent drought that has been a real challenge, and also transitioning to clean energy. ... And foresthealth and wildfires are important, critical in Colorado,"" said Dan Gibbs, director of the state's Department of Natural Resources, pointing to a $4.2 billion state backlog in forestry work and water conservation compelled by reduced flows in the Colorado River.
""We feel like we've been playing defense for the last four years. My hope is that, moving forward with the new administration, we'll be partners -- that we're going to get a call from the chief of the U.S. Forest Service or from the undersecretary of agriculture who is in charge of the Forest Service, saying, 'Hey, Dan, what are your priorities?' ""
At the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, state efforts dealing with air pollution, emerging water contaminants such as PFAS ""forever"" chemicals and degradation of waterways traditionally have hinged on cooperative support from federal agencies.
John Putnam, director of the state public health department's environmental programs, anticipated a reinvigoration of agencies for better enforcement of national clean air and clean water regulations that under T rump were weakened.
""We will move faster and farther when we are all pulling in the same direction,"" Putnam said.
""I'm certain there are going to be changes at the EPA"" after four years of a Republican administration, both refocusing policies and respecting ""the dictates of science,"" Putnam said. ""When those get turned around, we're going to be pulling in the same direction.""
State officials cited examples where they felt the T rump administration stymied Colorado environmental efforts, including legal action against California's stricter fuel-efficiency standards, which Colorado recently decided to follow. T rump officials also pressed Colorado to take the lead on toxic mine cleanups and assume liability if things went wrong. And the weakening of Clean Water Act protections removed safeguards for many streams across Colorado.
The increasing costs of dealing with climate change are falling largely on local communities where extreme weather and wildfires linked to warming hit home. In Boulder County, commissioners recently allocated $1.5 million to help deal with erosion and destruction of homes caused by the CalWood and Lefthand Canyon fires .
A consultant hired by the county estimated costs for building resilience to climate warming will top $150 million a year for nondisaster impacts on infrastructure such as roads.
The shift from T rump to Biden ""means the world -- the future of our planet,"" said Boulder County Commissioner Elise Jones, who also serves on Colorado's Air Quality Control Commission.
""We have to get on track on climate change in the next decade,"" Jones said.
""If we spent four more years under a climate change denier, we might have dug ourselves into a
hole bigger than we can get out of.""

Colorado_looks_to_logging_to_help_re-balance__Colorado_Daily_Boulder_CO___December_7_2020.txt,"Colorado lo o ks to lo gging to he lp re -balance - Colorado Daily (Boulder, CO ) - De ce mbe r 7, 2020
December 7, 2020  Colorado Daily (Boulder, CO)  Bruce Finley
GOULD -- Stunned by unprecedented megafires, Colorado is embracing logging -- mowing holes up to 140 acres in beetle-infested lodgepole pines -- in an effort to revive out-of-balance forests.
This for-profit mechanized tree-cutting, concentrated between the blackened Cameron Peak and East Troublesome burn scars, has been clearing 3,000 acres a year.
And state foresters propose to clear more.
At two cutting sites west of Fort Collins last week, hulking red and yellow tractors equipped with whirling hot saws sliced through 12-inch trunks of the towering pines, then as they thumped to the ground raked them into bunches. De-limbers stripped off branches. Hooked pinchers hoisted the logs into bus-sized loads for diesel-belching trucks. Drivers hauled these along icy mountain roads to sawmills at Saratoga and Parshall, where workers convert logs to lumber as a surging national wood-products market pays record prices.
This large-scale cutting creates fire breaks ""to give firefighters a place to make a stand"" and ""take out the energy"" from inevitable future record wildfires, Colorado State Forest Service director Mike Lester said.
When lodgepoles grow back, the surrounding broader forests will gain age diversity, with different species such as aspens popping up amid pines on newly-sunlit slopes, Lester said.
""In lodgepole forests, if you want to mimic what happens to lodgepole naturally, you do clearcuts,"" he said. ""Lodgepole pines naturally regenerate with forest -clearing fires.""
Colorado traditionally hasn't had logging on the industrial scale seen in Oregon and other northwestern states, and forest ecologists warn against clear-cuts that accelerate erosion, degrade wildlife habitat and enable increased human incursions.
But state officials now are turning to this large-scale cutting as an alternative to inaction at an especially difficult moment. Across western Colorado, insect attacks on old and drought-enfeebled trees over the past decade have ravaged 5 million acres. Systematic suppression of wildfires, federal land managers' priority for a century, has led to unnatural thickening.
For years, ecologists and emergency planners have warned that dying, dry and overly-dense forests would lead to massive, ruinous fires. Climate warming has emerged as the trigger, unleashing flames this year that burned across 700,000 acres, including the three largest fires ever recorded in Colorado: the Cameron Peak fire, at 208,913 acres; the East Troublesome fire, at 193,812 acres; and the Pine Gulch fire , at 139,007 acres.
""If we keep doing things as we've been doing, this is going to be what we will see,"" Lester said.
""The consequences of inaction""
Colorado's population growth and development boom, particularly the construction of mountain homes by people compelled to escape cities, complicates the forest imbalance. Houses in woods force progressively more aggressive fire-snuffing, which allows more increased thickening of trees.
A recent state report estimated a $4.2 billion backlog in forest -thinning needed to selectively clear trees and create safety buffers around the most at-risk forest homes. That's tree removal that state agencies and property owners generally must pay for -- in contrast to this industrial logging that brings in revenue when market conditions are right.
Last week, state foresters supervising the cutting of a 100-acre patch on Owl Mountain, within a 376-acre parcel controlled mostly by the federal Bureau of Land Management, pointed to the economics -- revenue of about $200,000 to state and federal agencies from loggers. And even if logging wasn't profitable, every dollar spent removing trees from fire-prone forests would save an estimated $7 in avoided firefighting costs, Steamboat Springs-based forester Carolina Manriquez said.
""Now we have 200,000-acre fires rolling through. What is 100 acres? Nothing at the landscape scale,"" Manriquez said. ""We need to do more of this. I mean, we're spending millions to suppress fires.""
Colorado forests that increasingly burn, along with millions of acres where beetle-kill leaves trees unusable, might have helped sustain logging companies, said C.J. Pittington, a Walden-based logger running a 40-ton red feller-buncher last week clearing a 140-acre chunk of state land. He can mow through about 5 acres of lodgepole forest in a day and has built up a business his father began in 1973, currently employing a dozen workers, and expressed hope the big fires will lead to greater social acceptance of large-scale logging.
Logging in forests near sprawling mountain municipalities also will help protect people, Pittington said, referring to the East Troublesome fire's destruction of 300 homes and other buildings.
""If the U.S. Forest Service would have done something like this behind Grand Lake, many homes there would still be standing,"" Pittington said.
Future expansion of logging in northwestern Colorado will depend on industrial capacity, said John T witchell, the supervisory state forester overseeing the work, who also serves on the state's forest advisory commission.
""Our logging industry has been small. We haven't had a lot of users of the wood. Our capacity to use wood will dictate how much work we can do on our landscapes,"" T witchell said.
""We want to re-generate a new, healthy forest . As long as this dead timber is here, inevitably, it is going to fall... and in time it will burn,"" he said. ""We've seen the consequences of inaction. ... If we can have more cuts like this, we can accomplish a lot of goals at once.""
""A storm of threats""
But forest ecologists raised concerns about the logging. Industrial clear-cuts of 40 acres or more widely have been seen as harmful. Lodgepole forests like those in northwestern Colorado play key roles in nature -- stabilizing mountainsides that otherwise erode into streams and eventually municipal reservoirs, helping form soil, giving habitat for raptors and other wild animals.
""If it is just willy-nilly punching holes in forests, it may not do any good at all and may make things worse,"" said Greg Aplet, a Denver-based senior scientist for the Wilderness Society.
Forest tree-cutting must be done based on large landscape-scale master plans, connected to broad restoration around the East Troublesome and Cameron Peak burn scars, he said. The risk is that Colorado forest officials, once beetle-killed lodgepole pines are removed from state land, will try to expand cutting on private and federal land by ""using social concern about fires to grab the social license to conduct more logging without the kind of review and careful ecological analysis that normally would attend large-scale logging,"" Aplet said.
""The Wilderness Society isn't opposed to logging. We're not opposed to 'forest management.' What we are opposed to is bogus science, poorly-planned projects and squandering money that could be spent on treatments that actually improve foresthealth,"" he said. ""There is reason to keep sawmills alive -- so that we have a destination for the logs that come out of well-planned forest restoration projects.""
University of Colorado Denver forest ecologist Diana Tomback said much depends on how much forest thinning is done and where. When westerners began snuffing wildfires a century ago, this obligated some form of logging to replace disturbed natural processes, Tomback said. But large clear-cuts cause erosion and even standing majority-dead forests can be preferable ecologically, she said.
""A storm of threats"" -- climate warming, megafires, insect outbreaks and drought -- ""is converging now to greatly diminish our nation's once-magnificent forests,"" Tomback said, suggesting Gov. Jared Polis should convene a forest science brain trust to develop a strategy.
""This convergence... is new, and we are learning. And the answers may not all be there,"" she said. ""But we need a methodical approach. We have to sit down and talk about a new forest management paradigm. We don't want to do things ad hoc.""
Federal forest managers at U.S. Forest Service headquarters weren't available for comment. A newly-appointed regional director has declined for a month to discuss the overall health of Colorado forests in the face of climate warming, insect infestations and wildfires.
Lester was looking to make that connection. Most of the acres burned this year were in federallymanaged forests, he said, urging better ""shared stewardship.""
Polis recently proposed spending $6 million for grants to improve foresthealth, but the scale of work to save dying forests requires far more, Lester said.
""What do we need from the feds? Certainly we need financial resources. And we need to sit down and coordinate what we are going to do. How are we going to get this done?""

Colorado_officials_hold_summit_to_get_public__Vail_Daily_CO___February_19_2021.txt,"Colorado o fficials ho ld summit to ge t public - Vail Daily (CO ) - Fe bruary 19, 2021
During a virtual panel discussion Thursday afternoon, Colorado officials emphasized a need for more cooperation among federal, state and local actors in Colorado's fight against wildfires.
Rep. Joe Neguse, who serves Colorado's 2nd Congressional District, hosted a public listening session Thursday, Feb. 18, to gain insights on the impacts and potential solutions to combat growing concerns about wildfires in the state. The session featured a panel discussion between Neguse, Gov. Jared Polis, Colorado Department of Public Safety Director Stan Hilkey and Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet.
In the wide-ranging discussion, officials shared their perspectives on the changes necessary to protect Colorado's public lands, property and lives, and they turned to residents for questions and to share their experiences with local wildfires in recent years.
""It doesn't escape me that the most devastating fires of 2020 burned at a time of the year when snow should be falling,"" Neguse said. ""Clearly, with the impacts of climate change, the need to promote healthy forests, the impacts on watershed health and the need to protect homes and businesses, wildfires are just a complex issue for our communities. There really is no silver bullet, which is why these conversations are so important so that we can all candidly talk about what steps we might be able to take in the Congress and the Senate, and of course here in Colorado, working together to solve these incredible challenges.""
The challenges indeed are incredible. The state saw the three largest wildfires in its recorded history last year -- the Cameron Peak Fire, East Troublesome Fire and Pine Gulch Fire -- which scorched nearly 550,000 acres across the state, burning down hundreds of homes and claiming the lives of two Coloradans. Looking back on the destruction, exacerbated by climate change and historically poor forest management tactics, officials promised to work toward comprehensive and holistic solutions.
One prevailing theme throughout the session was a need for more robust national support for Coloradans and other Americans throughout the West dealing with a new age of megafires. Bennet said the issue would require a hegemonic shift in understanding about the dangers wildfires pose to the state's infrastructure, environment and economy.
""One of the most important things we can do is change the way Congress thinks about our forests,"" Bennet said. ""Politicians in Washington need to understand that in Colorado, and across the West, forests are our infrastructure. They are as important to our state's economy as the Lincoln T unnel is to New York. But the truth is we have major challenges with this infrastructure. We're now dealing with the consequences of a century of fire suppression and chronic underfunding for the Forest Service. When you combine that with climate change, it's put the agency and state and local governments in a nearly impossible position. ...
""We're paying for wildfires after they happen rather than investing on the front end. That's fiscally
irresponsible, and ... we need, I think, a major shift at the national level to prioritize forest restoration and wildfire mitigation -- and a major investment to go with it.""
Bennet pointed to his bill, the Outdoor Restoration Force Act, which he said would spur a $40 billion federal investment in foresthealth, watershed restoration and climate resilience projects across the country; provide $20 billion in funds allocated to state and local governments; and create 2 million jobs in rural areas. Neguse also discussed the 21st Century Conservation Corps for Our Health and Our Jobs Act, which would allocate billions of dollars in funds to restore public lands and watersheds, improve foresthealth and reduce wildfire risks, among other endeavors.
Officials also highlighted the importance of local initiatives in the wildland-urban interface to mitigate wildfire risks. Polis likened at-home perimeter defense -- like removing trees and building firewise homes -- to biblical tales of Israelites marking their doors with lamb's blood before the 10th plague on the Egyptians, saying that homeowner mitigation efforts can help the ""angel of destruction"" that is a wildfire pass over.
Hilkey lauded local governments like Summit County for its efforts to create fire breaks thathelped to curb destruction during the 2018 Buffalo Mountain Fire , buthe said focusing on the state's ability to fight fires was equally important to protect communities.
""They had done an enormous amount of mitigation around the subdivision, but it alone did not save the subdivision,"" Hilkey said. ""It was also an aggressive initial attack. In any public policy conversation we have about wildfire in the American West, there's sort of two major topics of conversation: mitigation and suppression. ... Much of the time, it seems that people often try to choose one side or another. I want to encourage us all to resist the urge to do that and understand that mitigation and suppression need our full support. They're symbiotic to a successful Colorado future when we're talking about wildland fire .""
Prompted by questions from the public, Hilkey and other officials also discussed a need to work with communities to develop responsibly so chokepoints aren't created during potential evacuations, and to work with local governments and emergency agencies to study and train for mass evacuations to ensure they can be done smoothly and safely.
Members of the public also asked for better information during wildfires to keep residents informed about the status of their homes and properties, more support and funding for firefighters, better recovery efforts for those who've lost their homes or livelihoods, and help working with insurance companies to make sure homeowners can be made whole again.
Officials promised to take the conversation to heart as they return to their duties.
""We're in a place where we've got a decision to make about whether we're going to stand up for the next generation of Coloradans and Americans and leave a legacy that matters,"" Bennet said. ""When you stand in a forest ... that's been treated the way it ought to be treated, it starts to look a little more like a forest might have looked when Native American people were in Colorado. It's like standing in a cathedral. That could be our legacy if we pull together and really do the work that needs to be done. I'm grateful for this. This is a good, inspiring moment for us to take back to Washington and get to work.""
Courtney Walsh, a Boulder resident who losther home in the Calwood Fire , called on all Coloradans to come together to deal with the growing problem.
""We feel really lucky,"" Walsh said. ""We have our lives. We have our family and friends. We can't imagine getting through it without this amazing Boulder community. But I wouldn't want anyone to go through what we've gone through. ... All of us together have to work together to prevent future wildfires.""

For $12 a day, Colorado prison inmates trained to fight wildfires stand alongside the state's seasonal fire crews, battling some of the state's most devastating wildfires.
T hrough a Colorado Department of Corrections program, members of the State Wildland Inmate Fire Team receive the same training as the state's seasonal fire crews and have hands-on experience fighting fires when they're needed. The team was dispatched to the Cameron Peak fire last fall, which scorched more than 208,000 acres, and the Waldo Canyon fire in 2012, which killed two people.
It's a job that is physically demanding and risky. And, until this year, it likely wouldn't have led to a career fighting fires after they finished their sentence, thanks to stigma and discrimination against convicted felons.
Since its launch in 2002, more than 2,500 inmates have participated in the State Wildland Inmate Fire Team, or SWIFT , according to the Department of Corrections.
But fewer than 10 have been successful in getting jobs as full-time firefighters after they have finished their sentence, said Garry Briese, executive director of Colorado State Fire Chiefs.
""That's in the entire history of the program,"" Briese said. ""It's a pretty dismal job situation for SWIFT graduates coming out.""
A new law signed by Gov. Jared Polis is intended to make it easier for former prison inmates who worked on fire crews to get jobs in the industry after they've served their time.
The Colorado Department of Corrections has three fire crews of about 20 inmates each, but when those offenders leave prison, their criminal backgrounds have prevented them from getting jobs in the firefighting industry.
Offenders chosen for the wildland firefighter training program are ""model inmates"" who have good reputations and have expressed remorse for their crimes, said Aaron Greco, a lobbyist for the Department of Corrections who testified in support of the legislation this year. The jobs are among the most coveted in the prison employment program, he said, and the fire crews get to travel across the state to fight fires .
The new law says that people with felony convictions are eligible to work as wildland firefighters in the state Division of Fire Prevention and Control, and that the division is encouraged to hire former prison inmates who have worked on fire crews.
""This is one of the most exciting and cool bills I think that I've done in my time at the Capitol,"" said state Rep. Dylan Roberts, an Avon Democrat who was one of the prime sponsors of the leg islation.
The new legislation is a ""great first step"" that will bring opportunity to SWIFT graduates after they finish their sentence and allow them to ""get their life back on track,"" said Briese, with the State Fire Chiefs.
People in the program have told Briese they wanted firefighting jobs after prison, but have little hope in their chances of doing so, he said.
While the program helps boost morale and provide structure for those incarcerated, it also lowers recidivism rates by helping prisoners find jobs once they are released and leave prison with some money in their pockets, said Dean Williams, executive director of Colorado Department of Corrections.
Inmates who leave prison without jobs, without a home and no social connections are more likely to return to prison, Williams said.
The legislation also requires the state's division of fire prevention and control to start a peer mentor program for those hired by the agency after leaving prison so that they can develop professional skills.
""It doesn't solve all of our recidivism problems but it's important that we continue to take one more bite of the apple of providing work opportunities for people out of prison,"" he said.
A separate bill, which was signed by Gov. Jared Polis last week, allows for the State inmates Wildland Fire Team to nearly quadruple in size -- growing to about 125 people -- and expand its focus on forest restoration and fire mitigation efforts.
It will also allow firefighters in the program to earn more money: $50 for each day they are fighting fires and possibly more for supervisor positions, Williams said.
""We're going to pay a better wage, attract more people behind the walls to do the work,"" Williams said. ""And it provides a meaningful opportunity to give back to the community . It is a high public service.""
Barriers may still exist for graduates of the program looking for jobs at local fire departments, Briese said, adding that the new legislation removes some hiring obstacles for state agencies but doesn't affect local jurisdictions' hiring decisions.
""It is a great first step, but it is not the end,"" he said. ""It cannot be the end.""
Williams said he hopes the new bill helps reduce the stigma surrounding hiring those who have served time.
""I hope communities will view them as very reliable, safe individuals,"" he said, ""because they have proven themselves to be such.""
Firefighter jobs in Colorado are competitive, which poses another challenge for graduates of the
program, Briese said.
""There's rarely a shortage of people applying for firefighter jobs when they do become open,"" Briese said. ""So it's like: well if we have all of these people without felonies, why should we bend over backwards to make it easier for people with felonies?""
At the Larimer County Sheriff's Office Emergency Services Unit, which includes the county's fire program, Sgt. Kevin Johnston said firefighters typically must pass a background check to get hired. This year, he feels good about how many firefighters are available, but it's hard to predict how many firefighters the department will need as the season is just getting started.
The county has 50 on-call wildland firefighters, people who have regular jobs but have gone through firefighter training and respond to last-minute text messages to help with a fire. They get paid only when they work. Larimer County also has a six-member team on staff that responds to fires on private, public and federal lands.
The on-call team is larger than in previous years, thanks to a busy 2020 fire season that rallied interest in firefighting, Johnson said. The department doesn't want to hire more firefighters than necessary but it seems more are needed each year as fire season has stretched longer and gotten more intense in Colorado.
""When I first started, there was a fire season. It went from June to October,"" said Johnston, who has worked in the industry for 26 years. ""Now the fire season is kinda year round.""
Also, fire season used to begin in Arizona and New Mexico in May, then shift west toward Colorado. ""What we are seeing in the last couple of years is fires impacting the whole western part of the country at the same time,"" he said. ""We can get stretched thin.""
Larimer County also sends firefighters, including those who are on call, on temporary, two-week fire crews working across the country. Four firefighters from the county are now in South Dakota, Johnston said.

State and local leaders across the West are embracing ambitious water conservation initiatives in an effort to match the magnitude of the solutions to the challenges that lie ahead as droughts worsen and fire seasons become longer and more destructive.
The breadth, scope and interconnectedness of these ongoing projects was outlined during the recent Water in the West Symposium, hosted by Colorado State University's new SPUR campus at the National Western Center in Denver.
According to Colorado Governor Jared Polis, more than 500 innovative water projects are underway across the state, each of which are supported by data and funneled through a series of local basin roundtables to insure they reflect the goals of the statewide water plan. The state's model has earned acclaim for bringing together diverse interests to craft a methodical and comprehensive approach to future water needs.
Governor Polis said the state is looking ahead to updating and potentially revising the plan in 2022.
The state is also putting more emphasis on water and land use training by bringing in an interdisciplinary team of experts to help utilities develop meaningful action plans. In the past year, 17 training programs have been held around the state, Polis said.
Another priority is preserving the vital Colorado River, which he described as ""our namesake and the hardest working river in the West,"" by working with other western states and the federal government to protect Lake Powell reservoir.
Lake Powell and adjacent Lake Meade could encounter severe water shortages as early as 2025, according to symposium keynote Gary Knell, chairman of National Geographic Partners.
On the local level, symposium sponsor Denver Water hosted a virtual tour to share how the state's largest water utility has shifted from reactive to proactive on water supply and quality issues.
Denver Water serves 1.5 million people in the Denver metro and sources water across 2.5 million acres.
T hrough its Forest to Faucets initiative, the water utility is partnering with the Colorado Forest Restoration Institute to help improve forest management, reduce fire danger and mitigate post-fire impacts, according to watershed scientist Christina Burri.
""The Hayman Fire of 2002 was very costly to Denver Water, and that's what motivated us to make proactive investments in foresthealth,"" she explained.
Fire damage causes debris to drain into reservoirs and removing that sediment is costly and difficult. Denver Water spent $28 million on dredging and other reservoir clean-up following the
Hayman Fire , but the recent uptick in new wildfires has brought sediment control efforts back to square one. If upfront measures can reduce sediment deposition by even just 5 percent, it's worth the investment, she said.
Sylvia Bierman, acting regional director with the U.S. Forestry Service, said the agency has a Burned Area Emergency Response plan to address immediate impacts from fire events, with funding for activities such as applying mulch to burn scars. The National Resource Conservation Program has a similar project for private landowners, she added. But the agency is also seeking additional funding for longer term restoration, she said.
Denver Water has partnered with the Forest Service for more than 10 years, expanding the collaboration from large landscape and vegetative management projects to specific problems such as noxious weed control, she said.
Weston Toll, a wildfire mitigation specialist with the Colorado State Forest Service, noted that Denver Water's Forest to Faucets project is no longer unique as more utilities adopt their own prog rams.
""Most major Front Range water suppliers are also stepping up to the plate with similar programs, so that's really good to see,"" he said.
Leaders of neighboring states and tribal organizations also offered examples of how they are moving forward on water conservation.
Nevada Lt. Governor Kate Marshall gave a shout-out to Colorado for helping her state organize a new outdoor recreation agency.
""While outdoor recreation is very stable and resilient to recessions or pandemics, you don't want to love (our natural resources) to death,"" she said. ""One of the issues we've seen is that many, many people went to Lake T ahoe to get away from the (viral) threat, but that actually created a strain on the system.""
In addition to monitoring and addressing recreational impacts, the agency is expanding into areas not initially anticipated, such as quantifying the health benefits of outdoor recreation and improving outdoor educational offerings for kids from inner cities.
Nevada also created a program called WaterStart, which has since spun off into a free-standing nonprofit, which currently co-funds 31 different innovative water management pilot projects.
While Colorado State is establishing a building on the SPUR campus in Denver devoted solely to water, Nevada has its own Water Innovation Campus within the engineering department at the University of Nevada, which explores engineering solutions, such as using sound technology to find leaks in large municipal water systems. The center has joint international projects underway with Australia and Poland.
""We want to export ideas to other communities, even other countries,"" she said. ""We want to test those ideas here and then be the exporter of innovation.""
Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon, who grew up on a ranch and has a college-age daughter currently studying hydrology, and Stephen Roe Lewis, the recently re-elected governor of the Gila River Indian Co mmunit y in Arizona, talked about the importance of addressing aging water infrastructure and the need for collaboration between tribal, state and federal governments.
""Our irrigation infrastructure is a century old or older,"" Gordon said. When a tunnel collapsed on an important canal that also flows into Nebraska, the two states worked together to address the issue, he added.
Wyoming has established a new fund, which Gordon described as ""kind of an insurance approach,"" which is being used to fund vital improvements to dam structures, headgates, ditches and canals.
As droughts continue, the state is also drilling down into how to maximize water storage using the latest technology. Governor Gordon said the state is working to improve water supply forecasting and refine research on how the climate is changing and its affect on snow and run-off patterns, as well as modeling and sensoring capabilities, reporting automation and stream gauge monitoring.

As smoke from the California wildfires drifted eastward this summer, Holy Cross Energy CEO Bryan Hannegan had worries of his own in Colorado. In August, the hottest ever in Colorado, the Grizzly Creek fire growled and then charged several communities in the middle of his service territory that spans a 100-mile segment of Interstate 70 and includes the resort communities of Vail and Aspen.
But it was the fire that didn't happen that will worry him even after snowstorms arrive. What if the wires and other electrical infrastructure of Holy Cross Energy had started a fire? Despite all of Holy Cross' planning and policies, including extensive efforts to prevent its equipment from starting fires , one wildfire in the wrong place could cause liability that would take down the electrical cooperative.
""I can't speak for them, but I would venture to guess that every utility in the state, regardless of size, is worried about the potential for wildfire,"" Hannegan said.
Paradise fire made worries real
Utilities have always worried about wildfire at some level, but those concerns and the responses have elevated significantly as fires have ravaged California several times since 2017. California's 2018 Camp fire was pivotal. The fire at Paradise killed at least 86 people and caused the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas and Electric.
""I think that scares anybody who is involved in any utility,"" said Geoff Hier, director of government relations for the Colorado Rural Electric Association, a trade group of Colorado's 22 electrical cooperatives.
Climate change also figures prominently in the thinking of utilities along with the mosaic of conditions that have created greater risk for both wildfires and damages. Fires were successfully suppressed for much of the 20th century, delaying the inevitable. And Colorado, higher and wetter than many places, was less vulnerable.
Then came the 21st century. The Colorado Department of Public Safety's 2020 Wildfire Preparedness Plan reports the average of 8,170 acres burned annually in the 1960s had doubled by the 1990s, then doubled again. Entering this year, the top 20 wildfires had all occurred since 2000. Fires this year in Colorado, like those in California, have made those statistics obsolete.
Wildfire risks will almost certainly worsen. The Fourth National Climate Assessment published in 2018 projected the annual area burned in the contiguous western United States will increase 200% to 300% by mid-century. In a sense, this year's fires are merely a warm-up act. And this year's hot summer will, in the future, be considered cool.
People have also been rapidly moving into the foothills of Colorado and other areas called the
wildland-urban interface, an average increase of 2.5% annually from 1990 to 2010, according to a study conducted by Silvis Lab. As of 2017, half of all Coloradans lived in areas at risk to wildfires, the Colorado State Forest Service reported in 2018.
Electrical lines and other equipment cause fewer than 2% of all wildfires, according to Steve Rohlwing, manager of asset risk management for Xcel Energy, Colorado's largest electrical utility. In a filing with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission in July, Rohlwing said Xcel is aware of 14 wildfires at or near the company facilities. None were among Colorado's 10 largest.
But if the probability is low, the consequences can be high -- as was horrifically illustrated in California's Camp fire in November 2018. That fire was caused by the wind-whipped wires of Pacific Gas and Electric and sent the utility into bankruptcy in expectation of $30 billion in wildfireassociated liabilities.
""Wildfire risk has taken on increased prominence across the industry in recent years as many factors have contributed to increased wildfire impacts in the U.S., including changing climate conditions and increased development in high-fire-threat areas, and as a result of several highly publicized tragedies in California,"" said Brooke T rammell, Xcel's regional vice president for rates and regulatory affairs, in testimony before the Public Utilities Commission.
Xcel stepped up its fire-mitigation program after California's fires in 2017 destroyed 10,280 buildings, forced 230,000 people to evacuate, and killed 45 civilians and two firefighters. The damage was estimated to be excess of $18 billion. The Wall Street Journal later reported that at least 17 major wildfires that year in California were linked to Pacific Gas and Electric.
Make more coverage of Colorado's environment possible by becoming a Colorado Sun member, starting at just $5 a month.
Impacts before mitigation akin to 100-year flood
Modeling by Xcel revealed potential in Colorado for its electrical infrastructure causing a wildfire resulting in $2.6 billion in impacts in 1% of cases. That's akin to a 100-year flood. After the planned mitigation, the risk falls to $1 billion.
The utility says 2,100 miles of its overhead distribution feeder lines in its service territory and 2,900 miles of transmission lines are within the wildfire risk zone that was developed by the Colorado State Forest Service. Its goal has been to ""harden"" the electrical delivery system and revise operations to reduce risk by increased use of tools such as infrared inspection to identify thermal ""hot spots"" with priority in high wildfire risk areas, LIDAR technology and drones to provide detailed pole-top inspections.
By the following June, the company had assembled a wildfire mitigation team to explore what types of additional or accelerated projects could further mitigate the risk of utility-caused ignitions. Xcel spent $10.7 million in 2019 while inspecting 2,900 miles of transmission lines and replacing 2,305 distribution wood poles among the 67,162 it inspected.
In its filings, Xcel identifies $590 million in wildfire mitigation programs from 2019 through 2025. At
least some of these costs it seeks to recover through additional revenue via a rider on customer charge. If approved by the Public Utilities Commission, a typical residential electricity customer's bill would increase by 49 cents a month, to $69.53, Xcel says on its website. The rider would be adjusted during the next four years.
Colorado's electrical cooperatives have also stepped up their efforts to prevent electricity-sparked wildfires and prevent damage from other wildfires to electrical equipment.
United Power began creating its wildfire mitigation plan in 2012. Bryant Robbins, the interim general manager, said directors concluded that the greatest financial risk facing the cooperative was a fire in the mountains, and one specifically started by the utility's facilities.
A fire two years before in foothills west of Boulder, just outside of United's service territory, caused damage, including 172 burned structures, valued at $660 million. It was the most destructive wildfire to that time in Colorado. Fires along the Front Range in 2012 killed three people and also racked up $568 million in property damage.
""We began to see some of those damage amounts,"" said Robbins, then the manager of United's mountain division. ""We did not want to be the source under any circumstance, negligence or not, of any fire,"" he added.
United has 5,700 meters in the forested foothills of the Rocky Mountains among its 96,100 meters.
T rees trimmed, transmission lines buried
To mitigate risk, the cooperative in 2012 expanded the crews assigned to trimming trees in the rights-of-way of electrical lines from one to six and expanded other mitigation efforts.
Wind gusts in the mountains of up to 120 mph are dangerous enough that United Power put one sub-transmission 34.5-kilovolt line underground. United is also encouraging its new members to put distribution lines underground, an expensive ask at about $1 million a mile on the flats withoutheavy rock. In mountainous areas, it can run $20 a million a mile. But those lines are much more resistant to fires .
Like other utilities, United has changed construction standards. ""We no longer install any kind of porcelain insulators and replace existing ones, when possible,"" Robbins said. The porcelain insulators, he explained, are vulnerable to lightning strikes.
Despite all this, United feels vulnerable. ""Insurance companies not wanting to insure utilities in case of fire -- that is the biggest issue we're running into,"" Robbins said. ""T hree years ago we had $100 million of general liability insurance that would cover United Power's negligence as an ignition source, to handle claims. That got reduced to $75 million last year and then this year $45 million. We're hoping that Colorado will enact legislation this coming session that will mitigate that issue. We feel this is mostly the direct result of the claims they had to pay out in California.""
For United, Holy Cross and other utilities operating in forested areas, getting access to rights of
way to remove trees has been problematic at times. Many property owners want and expect the electricity but they want their trees, too. Further complexity comes from federal administration of 36% of Colorado's lands. Utility managers complain the agencies can be slow to approve vegetation removal.
Tom Walch, chief executive of Grand Valley Power, is concerned about the potential for a fire on Grand Mesa, east of Grand Junction. There, he worries about liability and the need to step up the removal of trees in rights of way. Part of that challenge is across federal lands, he said.
Walch said fires of recent years, particularly those in California, have raised awareness of the potential for trees and electrical lines coming into contact. Before, he said, a common sentiment was ""don't cut down our trees, don't mess with our forest . We love ithere.""
""The disastrous fires in California a couple of years ago really brought more people around to understanding that utilities had to have the right to control the right of way if they were going to be required to maintain service in these forested areas,"" Walch said.
Looking for guidance from lawmakers
Electrical cooperatives in Colorado want state legislators to specify best practices for vegetative management in rights of way and a process for clarifying the liability of utilities if those best practices are maintained. The Colorado Rural Electric Association is working with Xcel and Black Hills Energy, Colorado's second investor-owned utility, as well as the municipal utilities, to formulate a uniform position. It is also working with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association to address rights of way issues at the federal level.
The cooperatives want more: a backstop authority, funded partly by the state and partly by the utilities. The goal is to provide additional financial resources to help cover fire-related liability for any one utility that would otherwise drag them into bankruptcy -- if the utility had taken all feasible steps to reduce the risk of fire from its system. California has adopted such an approach. But Colorado's coronavirus-induced financial distress has put that conversation on hold.
At Holy Cross, Hannegan was thinking about wildfire risk when he became chief executive in 2017. He had a personal reason to do so. When he was in his 20s, a wildfire caused by utility equipment incinerated half of the 10 homes on the block in California where Hannegan's family lived. The Hannegan house -- where his parents still live -- was severely damaged.
""If not for the grace of God, the house where my parents live to this day would have been gone,"" he said.
A wildfire in July 2018 delivered a harsh reminder of the need for preparedness. It was caused by target shooters, not the utility, but Aspen very nearly lost electricity. A fire was beginning to lick up a wooden pole holding the third and last transmission line into Aspen when a quick-thinking utility employee arrived and extinguished the blaze.
After that, Holy Cross redoubled efforts to reduce vulnerability to wildfires, using the tools of United, Xcel and other utilities. The task, Hannegan said, is to find failures before they happen.
""When things do fail, as they inevitably will, will they fail in a way that substantially reduces the potential for sparks or something else that could increase risks of wildfire?""
But even as utilities get smarter and more diligent about reducing the risk of wildfire, the threat of a catastrophic fire continues to rise, the result of a climate becoming hotter and drier.
""My biggest fear is that it will still not be enough because the risk is so great,"" Hannegan said. ""This is not something that will go away in a year or two. This is a long-term trend that we have to factor into our business operations.""Freelance reporter Allen Best wrote this story for the Energy News Network.

Aug ust 30, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  THE GAZETTE
Here's a look at wildfires burning in Colorado:
Pine Gulch fire
Acres/Location: 139,006 acres/18 miles north of Grand Junction
Containment: 77%
Started: July 31, lightning
Firefighters: 753
The giant fire started by lightning on July 31 in a remote area north of Grand Junction quickly got out of control and has since grown to the largest wildfire in Colorado history as it races through grass, sage, pinyon-juniper and fir. The combination of drought, dry vegetation, unseasonably hot weather and steep terrain led to several weeks of explosive growth. In one night, the fire grew by 30,000 acres. As of Friday, it was estimated at 139,006 acres, surpassing the 138,114-acre Hayman fire in 2002 as the state's largest.
Despite its massive size, only one abandoned building has burned and no injuries have been reported. Containment has increased to 77%.
With resources in the West stretched thin, fire managers have begun drawing down the number of firefighters battling the Pine Gulch fire . On Friday, there were 753 firefighters, about 150 fewer than the 915 on Thursday.
The weather also has become an ally, with rain and lower temperatures through the weekend after weeks of 90-degree days and high winds. A cold front expected to arrive Monday could bring a return of 30 mph winds.
Grizzly Creek fire
Acres/Location: 32,464 acres/Glenwood Canyon
Containment: 73%
Started: Aug. 10, human caused
Firefighters: 644
Firefighters doused edges of the fire with helicopter water drops and strengthened fire lines with hand tools and dozers.
As containment increases, crews will shift their efforts to landscape repairs.
Interstate 70 could see intense rain, mudslides and rockfall over the weekend. The hazardous weather forecasts coupled with power pole repairs could create delays and intermittent closures along Intestate 70.
The road reopened between Gypsum and Glenwood Springs on Monday after days of closures while the fire burned just off the shoulder. Drivers are encouraged to exercise care and drive slowly.
Officials predict the fire will be fully contained by Sept. 18.
RELAT ED:
- Fire reported near Bishop Castle; pre-evacuation order issue for Willis Creek fire
- Poor air quality in Pikes Peak region 'incredibly rare,' Colorado meteorologist says
- Ash raining down on Colorado a sign of hotter, drier and more dangerous fire seasons

Williams Fork fire
Acres/Location: 12,097 acres/seven miles southwest of Fraser in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests
Containment: 10%
Started: Aug. 14, human caused
Firefighters: 396
The Williams Fork fire is burning on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland seven miles southwest of Fraser. The human-caused fire started near the Henderson Mill Aug. 14 and quickly grew due to high winds and steep slopes. Local firefighters immediately responded, but hot, dry and windy conditions allowed the fire to race through the timbered crowns of the lodgepole pine, fir and aspen forest .
The fire's spread has slowed in wetter, cooler weather. Crews and equipment are shifting to the east side of the fire area to construct containment lines around private land and the Fraser Experimental Forest .
Cameron Peak fire
Acres/Location: 23,007 acres/West of Fort Collins, Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests
Containment: zero percent
Started: Aug. 13, unknown cause
Firefighters: 742
The Cameron Peak fire ignited on Aug. 13 on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests near Cameron Pass and Chambers Lake. It is burning in heavy timber stands over rugged terrain. Hot, dry, windy weather, combined with critically dry fuels have kept firefighters from slowing its spread.
Rainstorms, higher humidity and lower temperatures should aid firefighters this weekend.
T horpe fire
Acres/location: 159 acres/Pike and San Isabel National Forest , west of Lake George.
Containment: 100%
Started: 1 p.m. Aug. 23, unknown cause
Firefighters: 24, three helicopters, three large air tankers, one very large air tanker.
The T horpe Fire started on Aug. 23 The fire is 159 acres and 100% contained with 24 personnel assigned as of Saturday. The fire was burning through grassy underbrush with occasional single tree torching of ponderosa pine timber. The Webber Park community, north of the fire, was evacuated on Aug. 23. The evacuation notice was lifted on Aug. 24. All road closures have been lifted; however some roads may be temporarily closed due to firefighting operations. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
East Fork fire
Acres/location: 2,842 acres/11 miles southeast of T rinidad
Containment: 17%
Started: Aug. 22, lightning
Firefighters: 55
The fire is burning on two state wildlife areas near the New Mexico border: James M. John State Wildlife Area and Lake Dorothey State Wildlife Area. Winds pushed the fire to the south toward the Colorado/New Mexico border, resulting in the evacuation of Sugarite Canyon State Park in New Mexico. The park is located on the ColoradoNew Mexico state line 6 miles northeast of Raton, N.M. Although the fire remains in Colorado, a watershed near Raton is threatened and has seen
some impact above Lake Dorothey.

Colorado_wildfires_blaze_through_130_million__Gazette_The_Colorado_Springs_CO___October_4_2020.txt,"Colorado wildfires blaze thro ugh $130 millio n - Gaze tte , The (Colorado Springs, CO ) - O cto be r 4, 2020
October 4, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Mary Shinn
Colorado's three largest wildfires this year have burned through about 300,000 acres and about $130 million.
The Cameron Peak, Grizzly Creek and Pine Gulch fires also took a toll on tourism, transportation, and air quality -- all carrying costs that are hard to quantify.
Bill Mart has borne those costs since the Cameron Peak fire broke out on Aug. 13 northwest of Fort Collins, ending what had been a good tourism season for his small general store in the unincorporated community of Red Feather Lakes, about a mile and a half from the fire .
The community was evacuated for the second time on Sept. 20 and Mart was among those who packed up, leaving his home and his shop, Red Feather Super Market.
""It's probably one of the hardest things I have ever done,"" he said.
The shop reopened Sept. 27, but solely to serve firefighters camped out in the area.
Mart and his wife wanted to serve the firefighters, but before they could open the doors they had to throw away thousands of dollars of food that spoiled while the electricity was shut off because of the fire.
""It's been a very stressful time, not only personally, but businesswise,"" he said.
Mart's home is in a subdivision of about 30 to 40 cabins where proper fire mitigation had not been done on most of the properties. If the fire had swept through, his house would have been at serious risk, he said.
""There is so much fuel on their property, it was going to keep the fire going,"" he said.
Cameron Peak had consumed 125,271 acres, damaged power lines and destroyed or damaged about 95 structures as of Friday morning -- the most damage to structures caused by any fire in the state this year.
About 50% of the trees that the Cameron Peak fire is burning through were killed by beetles, making them much drier and more susceptible, said Brett Smith, a fire behavior analyst assigned to the fire. Weather, including high wind, has driven the fire's growth, with most of it happening during 10 explosive days in the more than six weeks that it's been burning. Low humidity both day and night has also made the fire more difficult to control, he said.
""Those opportunities for the fuels to recover moisture have been few and far between,"" he said. The 9 inches of snow the fire received in early September simply was not enough. The fire needs precipitation for a week or two to fully extinguish it.
""Long-range forecasts don't show that kind of precipitation until the end of October,"" he said.
As the Cameron Peak fire has dragged on, its cost has steadily risen, reaching $61 million Friday, a bill that will be divided between the U.S. Forest Service, state of Colorado, and National Park Service. The costs of wildfires tend to fall on the agencies which own the land, said Caley Fisher, spokeswoman for the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control.
The Grizzly Creek fire, a 34,431-acre fire, has a $34 million price tag and Pine Gulch, a 139,000acre fire, was estimated to cost $35 million as of late September, according to the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, which coordinates wildland fire response across five states.
No one factor, such as air support, drives the cost of the fires, said Larry Helmerick, spokesman with the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination center. Rather, it's the combination of the aircraft, equipment, hundreds of staff members and support costs, such as supplying food and showers, he said.
""It's a tremendous financial outlay and aircraft are part of it, of course,"" he said.
If a fire can be stopped in the first few days after it breaks out, the cost can be held down to about $100,000. But when they blow up and last for weeks, that's when costs really start to add up, he said.
Fire mitigation such as thinning vegetation, clearing dead trees, and removing other fuels is key to slowing a fire down, stopping it earlier and saving homes. Mitigation can also ensure a healthier burn through the forest .
On the Cameron Peak fire some unmitigated areas saw close to 100% tree mortality. But, where mitigation was done, far more trees were left alive, Smith said.
The return on investment for mitigation can also be impressive. In Cedar Heights on the west side of Colorado Springs, $300,000 was spent on fire mitigation avoiding $77 million in losses from the Waldo Canyon fire , according to a report by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety.
But nationally and in Colorado, there are far more acres that need fire mitigation work than the federal government and other agencies can complete.
Five federal agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and National Parks Service, estimated in 2019 that nationally 100 million acres are at high risk for wildfire and they cannot complete all the work annually that needs to get done, according to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. In 2018, the agencies treated 3 million acres.
Fire mitigation is also expensive. The federal government spent $5 billion on it between 2009 and 2019.
But when the federal funding is doled out across the country it doesn't come close to meeting the
needs.
In the Forest Service's Dillon Ranger District, home to Breckenridge, Copper Mountain and Keystone ski resorts, the fire mitigation budget allows for fire mitigation across 1,000 acres annually within the 312,000 acre district that's been hit hard by the mountain pine beetle, said Bill Jackson district ranger.
Jackson and other fire officials say they prioritize areas near communities and watersheds.
To help protect communities, the Dillon District has been putting 300 to 500 foot buffers between subdivisions and the forest , he said.
""We are looking at opportunities to move the forest back,"" he said.
In 2018, one of the big fire breaks successfully protected 3,000 homes from the Buffalo fire, a wind driven blaze with 20-foot flames running through the treetops, he said.
""You could see it from all over Summit County,"" he said.
Once it hit the fire break near the homes it slowed down, allowing firefighters to fight it directly, he said. Ultimately, the fire stayed fairly small consuming 91 acres total and costing $2.1 million to suppress. The homes saved were worth $913 million.
To increase fire mitigation, voters in Summit County approved a property tax to raise an additional $1 million a year to help pay for fire mitigation, Jackson said. The work can cost up to $3,000 an acre when it has to be done by hand with chainsaws.
Prescribed burning is a far more cost effective way to remove dead and downed forest litter, but this fall it's been too hot and too dry to light the small controlled burns, he said.
""We are just not in a place where we can put fire on the ground,"" he said.
Private industry can help shoulder some of the costs when it can log or harvest some of the wood, Jackson said.
Within the Dillon District, Gypsum Biomass removes about 1,000 acres of lodgepole pine a year to burn for electricity, he said. The company can take live or dead wood, but they must be clear-cut because if they are just thinned the remaining trees will blow down later.
""It looks pretty raw the season it's cut,"" he said.
The clear-cut acres will regenerate with time and sometimes clearing the lodgepole pine can allow aspens in the area to flourish, he said.
In El Paso County, where hundreds of homes were lost in the Waldo Canyon and Black Forest fires, the community has not adopted the large fire breaks used in Summit County. But significant progress has been made, particularly on the west side.
A detailed map of the fire risk on each individual property within the wildland-urban interface shows hundreds of homes at low fire risk, an accomplishment that's taken decades, Colorado Springs Fire Marshal Brett Lacey said.
Although that does not mean the community will never see fire again, he said.
""What we're doing is changing the way the fire will behave to stack the deck in our favor,"" he said.
This year has been a particularly good year for mitigation on private property within the city.
The pandemic kept more people at home and they spent more time working on their yards generating material for the department to chip and haul, he said.
""This year with COVID, it's about killed us,"" he said of the load.
The department has chipped wood from 976 acres this year and handled 412 tons of biomass , he said.

Colorado_wildfires_Pine_Gulch_fire_now_second__Gazette_The_Colorado_Springs_CO___August_19_2020.txt,"Colorado wildfires: Pine Gulch fire no w se co nd - Gaze tte , The (Colorado Springs, CO ) - August 19, 2020
The Pine Gulch fire north of Grand Junction nearly doubled in size overnight for a second time, growing by almost 40,000 acres to become the second largest wildfire in state history.
The lightning-caused fire started July 31 and was at 125,252 acres Wednesday morning, according to the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center.
Its explosive growth places it behind only the 2002 Hayman fire , which burned 138,114 acres in Park, T eller, Douglas and Jefferson counties. Despite its size and ranking, the Pine Gulch fire has been far less destructive, burning in brushy, sparsely populated areas.
The Hayman fire, which was started by arson, caused six indirect fatalities, including five firefighters from Oregon who died in a traffic accident on their way to respond to the fire and a woman who suffered a fatal asthma attack from smoke inhalation.
Six hundred structures were lost -- 133 residences, one commercial building, and 466 outbuildings -- causing more than $42 million in housing losses. A total of 5,340 people were forced to evacuate.
What the Pine Gulch fire shares with the Hayman fire and three other major fires burning on the Western Slope, is its rapid, uncontrolled growth during extreme drought and weather, both attributed by many to climate change.
The fire grew more than 37,000 acres overnight as hot, dry, windy conditions persisted, said Larry Helmerick, with the coordination center.
Almost 900 firefighters on the ground and in the air are trying to increase containment which has held at 7% for more than a week.
Dried out pinyon, juniper, oak and sagebrush have been fueling the fire and no help is expected from the weather in the foreseeable future -- excessive heat warnings have been issued for western Colorado with highs in triple digits predicted.
Grizzly Creek fire
Of the other major fires burning in Colorado, the Grizzly Creek fire east of Glenwood Springs has been the nation's top firefighting priority because it has shut down Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon since it broke out Aug. 10.
On Wednesday, the fire was at 28,030 acres, with containment at 4%, the U.S. Forest Service said.
It was the firstheadway more than 800 firefighters assisted by 17 helicopters have been able to make in containing the blaze; previously containment had been at zero percent.
Roads and natural barriers helped firefighters in containing the fire , according to Mary Cernicek, spokeswoman for the Grizzly Creek fire. The fire's pace also slowed in aspens, which Cernicek said burn slower than conifer trees.
But weather is still a concern for firefighters as dry lightning and strong winds are possible amid thunderstorms in the next few days. T hunderstorms pose significant danger because winds can quickly change the direction the fire is burning, she added.
Williams Fork fire
Burning in the Arapaho National Forest 15 miles southwest of Fraser, the Williams Fork fire was at 6,726 acres Wednesday with 3% containment, the Forest Service said.
Cameron Peak Fire
Northwest of Fort Collins, the Cameron Peak fire is at 15,738 acres and remains zero percent contained.
Winds from thunderstorms are expected to exacerbate the spread of its smoke and flames. Fivehundred firefighters are battling the blaze along with 10 helicopters. There are several road closures but no structures have been damaged.
Red Canyon fire
A fifth, much smaller fire broke out Wednesday afternoon south of Glenwood Springs and north of Carbondale, forcing some evacuations, according to the Carbondale & Rural Fire Protection District.
Initially reported at 20 acres, it had grown to about 30 or 40 acres later in the afternoon.
The Garfield County Sheriff's Office tweeted that the fire was under control as of 8:12 p.m. and that an evacuation order issued earlier in the day had been lifted.

Aug ust 22, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  THE GAZETTE
Grizzly Creek fire did not increase in size overnight Friday, the incident command page said, remaining at 29,992 acres as of early Saturday. Containment remains at 22% and fire officials are hopeful in their containment efforts Saturday, said Jeff Surber, Great Basin Team 1 operations section chief, in a virtual community briefing.
""We have not released any resources off this fire in this area. I expect in the next day or two we'll start releasing folks to either go to other fires or be used elsewhere on our fire ,"" Surber said of the Grizzly Creek fire near the Interstate-70 and Coffee Pot Road area.
Firefighters are working Saturday to build dozer lines on a ridge near I-70 at the south end of the fire, and hope to gain more containment. Fire officials hope that with the completion with this line, the fire won't cross into the east side of Glenwood Springs, where firefighters built an ""insurance policy line"" via road systems, Surber said.
Meteorologists say the thunderstorm threat has diminished throughout the day early Saturday, according to Surber.
""Hopefully we don't get any new lightning strikes,"" Surber said, ""but if we do, we are prepared to go after those.""
The Red Canyon fire showed no signs of smoke or heat early Saturday. Suber said the fire shouldn't be a threat in the future.
On Friday, Colorado Department of Transportation said Interstate 70, which is currently closed between Gypsum and Glenwood Springs, could reopen within days.
The interstate has been fully closed through Glenwood Canyon since the Grizzly Creek fire broke out Aug. 10.
The portion of I-70 that has been shut down for nearly two weeks is crowded with work crews and
heavy equipment of all types as electrical poles are replaced and crews continue to clear debris, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Wayne Patterson.
""The good news is that corridor is looking more and more quiet as far as seeing flames from the highway,"" Patterson said.
Pine Gulch fire
The second largest wildfire in state history grew slightly to 126,613 acres by early Saturday, even as the nearly 900 firefighters - aided by air support - managed to increase containment to 19%.
The fire has been burning in sparsely populated areas north of Grand Junction since a lightning strike sparked the blaze on July 31.
Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order today that declares a state of disaster emergency due to the Pine Gulch fire in Mesa and Garfield Counties.
The order enables Colo. agencies to coordinate and make resources available for fire suppression, response, consequence management, and recovery efforts.
Pat Seekins, section chief for Rocky Mountain Incident Management Type 1Team said the south end of the fire has seen some activity over the last couple of days. Crews have successfully contained the fire in southeast area via fire lines.
""This is an example of some really great work by firefighters, both day and night shifts, completed yesterday,"" Seekins said.
The terrain in the southeast area of the fire is still too difficult for firefighters to get to, so crews are letting fire continue burning towards a road system, where crews can then aggressively attack flames, Seekins said.
There is a small chance of thunderstorms developing to the west after 2 p.m. Saturday, which could produce outflow winds up to 20 mph and cause active fire behavior, according to a Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team press release.
Haze and areas of smoke will continue Saturday morning across portions of central and western Colorado especially in the Grand Valley.
West winds continue Saturday afternoon around 7-9 mph with gusts up to 14 mph that will bring durations of heavy smoke and periods of unhealthy conditions through communities of Fruita, Loma, Grand Junction, Clifton, and De Beque.
Heat, drought and wind have not let up since the start of the fire, with temperatures in the 90s and gusty winds daily.
Seekins said the north, south and eastern areas of the fire are under ""patrol status"" by engine crews.
""Everything on the north edge is looking really good,"" Seekins said.
Despite its massive size, the fire has burned only one structure, an abandoned outbuilding.
Williams Fork fire
The fire in the Arapaho National Forest southwest of Fraser grew to 10,437 acres by early Saturday, but more favorable weather allowed firefighters to make some progress in extinguishing the human-caused blaze, the Forest Service said.
The human-caused fire started near the Henderson Mill August 14 and quickly grew due to high winds and steep slopes, officials said.
Containment sits at 3%, the incident command page said.
There are no evacuation orders in effect, but the Grand County Sheriff's Office have asked residents along County Road 50, County Road 50S, County Road 73, Aspen Canyon, Morgan Gulch to be prepared to evacuate. See a map of potential evacuation areas here.
Cameron Peak fire
Evacuation map
The 17,246-acre Cameron Peak fire west of Fort Collins is still growing rapidly and poses a threat to the Poudre River, the city's water supply, utilities officials said Friday.
At 2:32 p.m. Friday, the Larimer County Sheriff's Office sent the following alert to residents threatened by the blaze:
""The Cameron Peak Fire activity has increased in the area south of Highway 14 toward Crown Point, the Pingree Park Road and County Road 44H area. Mandatory Evacuations have been ordered for residents and businesses in the area, up to and including Pennock Pass on County Road 44H due to immediate and imminent danger.""
Read more about the area's evacuation statuses here.
The blaze remains zero percent contained.
National Guard activated
Also Friday, Gov. Jared Polis activated the Colorado National Guard to provide support for firefighters battling four major wildfires on the Western Slope.
A Colorado Army National Guard Black Hawk helicopter and crew is on standby at the High-Altitude Army National Guard T raining Site in Gypsum for search and rescue. The Black Hawk is equipped with a hoist that can evacuate firefighters and residents.
The state emergency operations also requested 30 soldiers for traffic control to assist the Larimer County Sheriff's Office to restrict unauthorized access to the Cameron Peak fire area.

Residents in the East Troublesome fire area who are still under mandatory evacuation orders to keep off of their properties, for safety concerns, will have a two-hour entry window on Saturday and Tuesday.
Some heavily damaged areas, including along Colorado 125 north of mile marker 5 and the Sun Valley area, will have limited temporary access, and residents must receive an admittance card, from the Disaster Assistance Center at the The Inn at Silver Creek, in Granby, to get back in through checkpoints.
The access, from 1-3 p.m. each day, is for insurance purposes and other basic essential tasks and chores, said Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin.
""Many people are frustrated because they feel we aren't getting them in quick enough,"" Schroetlin said at a Friday evening briefing. The re-entry phase Saturday and Tuesday is a ""plan that works for our community ... we are trying to accommodate everyone.""
On Friday morning Schroetlin met with family members of Lyle and Marylin Hileman, 86 and 84, respectively, who died in the fire. An American Flag was raised over their property.
Snow blanketing the East Troublesome and Cameron Peak wildfires is slowly melting and some smoldering fire pockets are smoking, but the fires have had little to no growth this week.
""It's a slow, controlled melt, which is what we want to see,"" said Noel Livingston, incident commander of the East Troublesome fire, at a Friday morning briefing.
On Friday, firefighters worked along the U.S. 34 and U.S. 40 corridors. Firefighters addressed ""hotspots"" along Colorado 125, fire officials said.
Skies were sunny on Friday with high temperatures climbing into the mid-30s. Winds on Saturday will gust to about 25 mph as high temps climb into the lower 40s under sunny skies. Precipitation isn't in the forecast until the first full weekend of November.
Smoke was visible Friday in the northern portion, the most active section, of the fire, and smoldering continues in other areas as well.
Fire crews continue to work on a containment line along the East Inlet Trail in Rocky Mountain National Park. ""This line will be used to help stop fire spread if fire behavior increases in the future,"" according to an update.
Rocky Mountain National Park remains closed because of the wildfires.
The East Troublesome fire, the second largest wildfire in state history, has burned 193,774 acres,
almost 303 square miles, in Grand County and it is 32% contained.
The Cameron Peak fire, also calmed by the earlier snowstorm, has pockets that are smoldering and producing smoke. The Pingree Park area reported 27 inches of snow.
On Thursday, road conditions improved in some areas, allowing firefighters more access to work on the wildfire.
""Firefighters were able to access the southern perimeter of the T hompson Zone and began constructing fireline directly along the fire edge,"" according to the Friday morning update.
Poor road conditions in the Storm Mountain area is limiting access. Fire crews have gotten into the Buckhorn Road area to check on fire containment lines and continue work there.
On Friday afternoon the Larimer County Sheriff's Office downgraded the mandatory evacuation notice, to voluntary, for County Road 44H from Moody Hill west to Pennock Pass.
All National Forest System lands in the Canyon Lakes Ranger District remain closed.
Skies over the fire area were mostly sunny and afternoon temperatures climbed into the mid-50s. Winds were expected to pick up overnight Friday, gusting up to 50 mph by Saturday morning before diminishing in the late afternoon.
The Cameron Peak fire, the largest in state history, has burned 208,663 acres, about 326 square miles, in Larimer County. The fire is 64% contained.

Several major wildfires continued to burn across Colorado on Monday.
The fires have collectively burned more than 304 square miles, fueled by abnormally dry conditions and hot weather that are part of a 20-year shift in Colorado's climate toward greater aridity.
Click here to skip to a specific fire : Pine Gulch fire  Grizzly Creek fire  Cameron Peak fire  Williams Fork fire  Lewstone fire  T horpe fire  Wildfire mapPine Gulch
Updated as of 7:01 p.m.
The Pine Gulch fire grew to 134,108 acres Monday, or about 209.5 square miles, and containment ticked up to 47%, according to fire officials.
It remains the second-largest wildfire in Colorado's recorded history, although it is close to overtaking the largest recorded fire , the 2002 Hayman fire , which burned 137,760 acres, or 215 square miles, and destroyed hundreds of buildings and homes.
Pat Seekins, operation sections chief, said the containment line has grown continuously from a northeast section of the fire zone down to a southeastern section after a week of ""good work"" by firefig hters.
There was little fire activity Monday on the westside of the fire. A containment line along Colorado 139 continues to improve. ""T hings are looking really good"" there, Seekins said.
With the fire's spread to the east stopped, firefighters are now shifting their focus to the northwest parts of the fire , and will work to establish indirect control lines, particularly in an area between the 256 Road and the 266 and 267 Roads. The area might see thunderstorms Monday, which could bring increased wind and lightning, but are unlikely to bring significant rainfall.
About 900 people are fighting the Pine Gulch fire , which was started by lightning July 31 and is burning about 18 miles north of Grand Junction.Grizzly Creek
Updated as of 6:42 p.m.
Both the size and containment of the Grizzly Creek Fire grew slightly overnight Sunday, with the blaze burning 30,719 acres, or about 47 square miles, and containment increasing from 30% to 33%.
Evacuations were lifted Sunday evening for residents of No Name, who can return home but should remain vigilant, according to the Garfield County Sheriff's Office.
Bulldozer containment lines have been dug along No Name and up along Windy Point as part of a
plan to keep the fire from heading west, cutting it off from a run toward Glenwood Springs, said Jeff Surber, operations section chief, during a Facebook briefing. A containment line along Coffee Pot Road was expected to be finished at the end of the day Monday.
The Hanging Lake area has been spared of major fire or damage, but the lake remains closed until trail damage around the lake is complete and the area is deemed safe for return.
On Monday, crews expected to see increased fire activity, and a focus on controlled burns near the Bair Ranch area and to the south was planned. Existing control lines are holding, fire officials said.
Interstate 70, which had been closed between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum for two weeks, reopened in a limited capacity Monday, with authorities telling drivers to expect slower speeds through the canyon. Drivers also will not be allowed to stop along that stretch of interstate because of the ongoing danger of mudslides or rockfalls.
About 811 people are working the fire, which is burning in Glenwood Canyon about 1 mile east of Glenwood Springs. The cause of the fire, which started Aug. 10, is unknown.Cameron Peak
Updated as of 6:22 p.m.
The Cameron Peak fire reached 20,118 acres Monday, or about 31 square miles, and remains 0% contained.
Jake Livingston, planning operations, said during a Facebook briefing that work on structure protection and containment lines continued on Monday.
At least 44 structures were the focus of protection work on Monday in one section as bulldozers continued to build containment lines, removing trees and trucking them away in some areas on the north end of the fire, Livingston said. Hand crews come in behind the bulldozers to further advance the job of removing fire fuels.
Improvements on Monday included along Dead Man Road and Manhattan Road, Livingston said.
No structures or facilities have been damaged, fire officials said on Monday.
Firefighters on Monday also focused on structure protection, indirect suppression activities and on preparing for a controlled burn along Colorado 14 to the Rawah Divide. On Sunday, the fire grew to the southeast toward Peterson Lake and moved north of the West Fork T unnel area.
The fire was expected to grow on Monday because of the wind and terrain, and is expected to continue to spread along Long Draw Road and toward Rocky Mountain National Park, which has closed some areas because of the blaze.
About 722 people are working the fire, which is burning in Larimer County about 15 miles southwest of Red Feather Lakes. The fire started Aug. 13 and the cause is unknown.Williams Fork fire
Updated as of 5:59 p.m.
The Williams Fork fire grew slightly to 11,048 acres, or 17 square miles, Monday and remains 3% contained.
Mike Johnston, deputy operations chief, said Monday afternoon during a Facebook briefing that firefighters continue to build containment lines and work on structure and property protection.
The fire is burning into natural ""confinement"" areas, including on the eastside of the fire zone where it almost ""already has burned itself out,"" Johnston said.
There are no evacuation orders for residential areas in the Fraser Valley. Residents and guests to the area can receive emergency notifications by signing up for CodeRED at gcemergency.com.
Firefighters on Sunday made progress preparing containment lines on the west and southwest portions of the fire. Controlled burns were planned for either Monday or Tuesday, depending on weather, to remove vegetation between those containment lines and the main front of the fire, which will reinforce the containment, fire officials said.
Residents could see increased smoke as those controlled burns are carried out.
About 312 people are fighting the fire, which was started by humans on Aug. 14 and is burning about 7 miles southwest of Fraser.Lewstone fire
Updated as of 4:23 p.m.
The Lewstone fire did not grow much overnight Sunday, according to the Larimer County Sheriff's Office. The 165-acre blaze was about 12% contained Monday afternoon.
About 180 firefighters are working the blaze, which is burning northwest of Fort Collins between Colorado 14 and Rist Canyon. Aircraft will provide additional support Monday.
On Monday afternoon, an evacuation order for the Pine Acres residential area north of Rist Canyon Road was downgraded by the sheriff's office to voluntary evacuations for the area. The sheriff's office urged returning residents to be cautious as fire crews are still present in the vicinity.T horpe fire
Updated as of 4:35 p.m.
On Monday afternoon, fire officials estimated the fire, which started Sunday afternoon and forced the evacuation of two subdivisions in Park County, to be about 159 acres.
Mandatory evacuations are in effect for campers off of County Road 31 and nearby forest service roads, according to county officials, and for residents of the Webber Park Subdivision. The Lake George Community Center, 29141 U.S. 24, Lake George, is serving as a center for evacuated residents.
Crews made progress establishing fire lines overnight Sunday and will continue to reinforce those lines Monday, fire officials said.

DENVER (AP) -- Colorado's second-largest wildfire in state history was most likely caused by human activity, Gov. Jared Polis said Friday.
The East Troublesome fire which forced nearby evacuations and closed Rocky Mountain National Park took over 265 square miles (686 square kilometers) -- an area larger than the city of Chicago -- and was only 5% contained as of Friday afternoon.
The fire reaching the number two spot means that Colorado's top three largest fires have occurred during the 2020 season.
Polis said the two main reasons for Colorado's increased wildfire risk are due to the state's warmer climate and increased population which means more land utilization.
The biggest takeaway from this devastating and record-breaking wildfireseason is a ""sense of great humility in the face of nature that we have with regards to these large events,"" he said.
Colorado is expecting precipitation to arrive Saturday night into early Sunday with the hopes that snow will tame the fire's activity and growth.
Noel Livingston, incident commander for the East Troublesome fire, said Friday they were expecting the fire to grow throughout the day as winds posed challenges to firefighters on the ground and aviation efforts to calm the spread from above.
Colorado's largest fire in Cameron Peak has burned over 323 square miles (837 square kilometers) and was 57% contained as of Friday.
Damage assessments from the East Troublesome fire were pending as authorities focused on protecting the evacuated resort town of Grand Lake and fighting the fire itself. The only official indication of damages was given on Thursday by Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin who said there had been ""lots of structural loss.""
""We're not withholding information. We're not trying to delay information getting out there. We don't know,"" Schroetlin said at a fire briefing Friday. ""I've been through many of these areas up in there and things change every pasture that I go.""
The sheriff could not confirm any missing people as a result of the fires but Schroetlin said that the list is very small and fluctuates with many people who are found in various shelters or at other family member's homes.
Gov. Jared Polis activated Colorado's National Guard to assist in any search and rescue operations, conduct aerial reconnaissance of the state's fires and conduct damage assessment.
Polis said more than 6,500 homes had been evacuated and that officials were working to secure hotel rooms for evacuees from Grand County and the resort town of Estes Park, which was evacuated as a precaution on Thursday. The national park itself was closed as fire encroached on the west and to the north.
Peter Comer who was working a seasonal job at the YMCA in Estes Park said he and some friends weren't expecting to evacuate until the alert was issued.
""It was pretty hectic 'cause we left in about 20 minutes. We just kind of had to throw our stuff together and pack up and leave,"" he said.
Comer said evacuating because of a wildfire was surreal.
""This is the first time I've ever had to do anything like this; it's been a learning experience,"" said Comer, who is originally from a small city outside of Des Moines, Iowa. He said the traffic was so bad they were stuck downtown for two hours.
Although the plan is to return to Estes Park, for now, Comer is staying at a YMCA camp in Grant until they have permission to return.
East Troublesome is the state's priority fire and has 725 personnel assigned to fight the flames, Livingston said.
The cold, damp weather east of the Continental Divide helped firefighters battling the Cameron Peak blaze, the state's largest recorded wildfire at 323 square miles (517 square kilometers), west of Fort Collins, as well as two smaller fires in Boulder County to the south. Crews had contained nearly 60% of the Cameron Peak fire Friday.
The Mullen Fire, which started in Wyoming's Medicine Bow National Forest and crept into northern Colorado, showed little activity with crews tamping hot spots. It had charred nearly 280 square miles (450 square kilometers) as of Friday.

Colorado_wildfire_season_a_grave_concern__Pueblo_Chieftain_The_CO___April_25_2021__pA10.txt,"Colorado wildfirese aso n a grave co nce rn - Pue blo Chie ftain, The (CO ) - Ap ril 25, 2021 - p age A10
April 25, 2021  Pueblo Chieftain, The (CO)  Miles Blumhardt; Fort Collins Coloradoan  Pag e A10
Last year in early April, Colorado was flush with snowpack, the statewide average at 108% of normal and snowmelt spilling over dams at places like Lake Granby.
Then all hell broke loose.
What looked like a promising water year quickly dried up.
An extremely warm, dry April, May and June combined with the fourth consecutive year of Colorado missing out on July monsoon moisture set the stage for the largest wildfireseason in state history.
This year's statewide snowpack was just 77% of average as of Monday.
While the South Platte Basin, which includes Denver and Fort Collins, was at 96% of average Monday, the drought-stricken Western Slope remains exceptionally dry with none of the basins reaching 80% of average. The Arkansas River Basin was at 85%.
And that has caused great concern.
That has left many to wonder if Colorado will see a repeat of last year's devastating wildfireseason, in which more than 5,300 wildfires burned more than 600,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 homes, the impacts of which now threaten major watersheds.
""I'm cautiously optimistic now, but as we saw last year, things can turn quickly,"" said Becky Bolinger, a drought specialist with the Colorado Climate Center and assistant state climatologist.
Timing of
moisture is key to stave off wildfires
Bolinger said an abundance of snow in March was the first thing that needed to happen to dampen this year's fire season. But she said April and May, two of the state's wettest months, must also produce at least average moisture, otherwise we will be looking at a repeat of last year.
""I liken it to budgeting your bank account,"" Bolinger said. ""We started the water year with a big debt. We have been making minimum payments but not really reducing the debt. The March storm was a big payment and we paid down some of the debt, but we still have debt to pay.""
She said typically snowpack peak happens in early April, then the snow starts melting at a faster pace than it snows. Not only did we not add much snow in the mountains in April and May last year, Bolinger said, but the warm weather quickly melted the snow.
What happens in this scenario is moisture from snowmelt produces vegetation growth early. Without continued moisture, that vegetation dries out and, coupled with drought-stressed and brittle beetle-kill trees, becomes fuel for wildfires.
Occasional June thunderstorms and the July monsoon help keep vegetation green and less prone to wildfire.
Missing out on that moisture last year helped create conditions that resulted in another late wildfireseason. The Cameron Peak Fire started Aug. 13, and the East Troublesome Fire started Oct. 14.
Water is a delicate balancing act
This year's water watch is even more worrisome than most.
That's because of the charred carnage left behind by the two largest wildfires in state history -- the 208,913-acre Cameron Peak Fire and 193,812-acre East Troublesome Fire.
While snowpack and rain are needed to recharge badly depleted soil moisture from last year's drought, if the snow runoff occurs too quickly and rains are too torrential, there is the threat of flooding in the burn scars.
And Colorado's weather has a history of extremes.
What might prevent that is the soil being so dry from recent drought that it soaks up a lot of that snowmelt and rain.
That is good news for fire prevention and potential flooding but not so good news for water storag e.
Jeff Stahla, Northern Water spokesman, said water supply is like a three-legged stool, with soil moisture and water available east of the Continental Divide and Western Slope making up the three leg s.
""The March storm was one of those $1 million storms that really boosts the soil moisture profile,"" Stahla said.
Buthe said another dry spring and summer could deplete the supply and that a lack of adequate snowpack to replenish reservoirs could spell trouble.
""Even though it seems like we have plenty of water on the Front Range now, it's important to be efficient with water use because everything is interconnected,"" he said. ""How we use our water this year has an impact later this year and in future years.""
State beefs up firefighting resources
Earlier this month, Gov. Jared Polis signed legislation that added millions of dollars to the state's firefighting effort. That included wildfire mitigation, extending the number of days the state can lease air tankers and helicopters from private contractors, and purchasing a Sikorsky Firehawk helicopter, which will arrive in summer.
But Colorado has already seen wildfires this spring.
""One of the things that is a paradigm change is Colorado used to talk about a fire season,"" Polis said. ""It's now a year-round phenomena.""
Another change this year is how the state will battle wildfires.
At the Polis press conference earlier this month, state fire officials said the state will allocate more resources to local governments and take an aggressive initial attack to better contain fires and keep them from spreading near houses and businesses in the foothills and mountains.
Cameron Peak Fire incident command teams used a different strategy. They built perimeter fire lines well out from the fire, which started in Roosevelt National Forest . They said the remoteness, fuel loads, difficult terrain and danger to firefighters were reasons for creating a defensible perimeter and not focusing on directly fighting the fire.
However, extreme hot and windy weather at various times overwhelmed the fire lines in areas, resulting in the loss of 461 structures, including 224 homes.
The cost of battling the 112-day Cameron Peak Fire was $134 million, which was more than the cost of fighting all the rest of the state's wildfires combined last year.
With recovery work is only now getting started to repair damage left behind by the Cameron Peak Fire , the next few months will be critical in determining if the state is in for a repeat of last year's devastating wildfireseason.
""The true nature of this fire season won't be apparent until we see the April and May precipitation,"" Polis said.

Jeff Surber with the Great Basin Incident Management Team said there has been much success containing the Grizzly Creek Fire in recent days.
Surber and the Great Basin team facilitated a routine transfer of management on the fire to the
Alaska Interagency Incident Management Team on Tuesday.
The Grizzly Creek Fire, which started Aug. 10 and has burned 32,060 acres, now appears to be ""in mighty good shape,"" Alaska team Incident Commander Tom Kurth told the community in a Facebook live broadcast Tuesday.
Surber said as the Alaska team attempts to wrap up the fire, challenges could occur in containing certain areas where the risk of standing dead trees, or snags, make it dangerous for firefighters to fight the fire on the ground. The Great Basin team has set up alternative plans to deal with those areas.
Surber said rain could also affect the outcome of certain areas of the fire in the days to come.

Cameron Peak Fire
Location: 15 miles southwest of Redfeather Lakes
Size: 21,017 acres
Containment: 0%
Start date: Aug. 13
Cause: under investigation
The Cameron Peak Fire, burning about 15 miles southwest of Red Feather Lakes, received some beneficial cloud cover Tuesday, fire officials said in an afternoon briefing on Facebook.
Precipitation is expected Wednesday, according to the fire zone weather forecast, and officials are hoping for two-tenths of an inch of moisture with more possible rain as the week progresses. Winds, however, could push the fire this upcoming weekend.
Williams Fork Fire
Location: 15 miles southwest of Fraser in Grand County
Size: 11,726 acres
Containment: 5%
Start date: Aug. 14
Cause: human caused
Containment on the Williams Fork Fire has increased to 5%.
Containment efforts continued along the Williams Fork River by burning remaining pockets of fuel between County Road 30 and the fire perimeter. A helicopter supported ground crews with aerial fire ignition.
While the efforts were successful, additional days of work will be necessary to provide full containment along this area of the fire.
In other areas, the Colorado National Guard assisted in support of fire suppression efforts with two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and one CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The helicopters were equipped with buckets to drop water on areas of heat and help ground-based firefighters slow the spread.

Predicting wildfire activity from day to day is a lot like predicting the weather. In fact, they go hand in hand, explains Matt Jeglum, a meteorologist working with the Grizzly Creek Fire incident command team.
Weather has a lot to do with the ability of firefighters to gain the upper hand on the now nearly 30,000-acre fire burning in and above Glenwood Canyon -- both good and potentially bad. By Friday morning, the fire was reported to be 11% contained.
""We have seen quite a few thunderstorms in the vicinity of the fire, some of which are putting down heavy rain in places,"" Jeglum said in a Thursday afternoon interview.
""Heavy"" by recent standards, Jeglum clarified during that evening's community meeting webcast live via Facebook. ""But not by the normal standards you're used to seeing this time of year.""
Those storms have also brought gusty, erratic down-draft winds and some lightning strikes, which, unlike rain, are nothelpful in fighting fires.
One of those lightning strikes is believed to be the cause of the new Red Canyon Fire that burned about 50 acres Wednesday evening roughly five miles south of the Grizzly Fire area in the upper Spring Valley area.
Fire Operations Section Chief Jeff Surber said during the community meeting that a ""wellcoordinated"" air and ground attack got the blaze knocked down. No structures were lost, and residents who had to be quickly evacuated were allowed back in later that night.
Thursday afternoon's thunderstorm winds reignited one corner of that fire, burning about 10 additional acres before it, too, was knocked down, Surber said. Crews are continuing to monitor that area both day and night to watch for anymore hot spot flare-ups, he said.
Monsoons building
Looking ahead to the next few days and into next week, Jeglum said drier and hotter days are expected to return Friday through the weekend.
But, ""things could get interesting"" starting Monday and into the middle of next week as the monsoonal weather pattern that is more typical this time of year is expected to return.
That's good on the precipitation front in terms of helping with fire containment, but could be bad if a heavy rain cell develops over the fire burn area in Glenwood Canyon, he said.
""The monsoon season has been largely a failure this summer from Arizona and Utah and into Colorado,"" Jeglum said.
But that familiar high-pressure system over the western United States is starting to build again, which could bring both relief and the threat of debris flows in fire burn areas across the region.
In Glenwood Canyon, a special Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team is already evaluating potential for debris flows and rockfall hazards, and working on a plan to mitigate the danger before Interstate 70 reopens, said Lisa Stoeffler, deputy supervisor for the White River National Forest .
""We are looking at the immediate risks for rockfall and debris flow if a storm hits,"" she said. ""We will be meeting with key partners, including CDOT , the city of Glenwood Springs and county emergency services to plan for those potential storm events.
Weather and fire
Jeglum also described the ""wildland fire triangle"" that goes into the daily tactical decision-making when it comes to fighting fires. The three sides of that triangle are terrain, fuels and weather.
""Obviously, the terrain is static and doesn't change, so it's the fuels and weather that we look at, and weather is what drives the fuels,"" he said.
Jeglum spends his days on a fire incident in front of his computer watching satellite and radar imagery, and making surface observations, looking for thunderstorms and lightning and other weather events. He then relays that to the incident commanders and those in the field so they can make the right tactical decisions, he said.
Jeglum's ""day job"" is as a research meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Salt Lake City. He was a firefighter in college, and now spends a good part of his summer working with fire incident command teams across the west.

UPDAT E 2:30 p.m. Tuesday -- The Grizzly Creek Fire Incident Command has reported that the fire is moving uphill on the south side of the Colorado River. The command has expanded evacuation notices to include the residents of Lookout Mountain as well as a pre-evacuation of Bair Ranch.
UPDAT E 1 p.m. Tuesday -- The Grizzly Creek Fire Incident Command has directed an evacuation notice for the residents of No Name. The Glenwood Springs Community Center is the emergency relocation point and shelter at this time, according to the latest from the fire command.
The fire has grown to an estimated 1,832 acres, as of the latest aerial mapping.
UPDAT E noon Tuesday -- The Interstate 70 safety closure remains in effect until further notice to allow Colorado Department of Transportation crews to assess two bridges located near where the Grizzly Creek Fire started on Monday.
There is also now increased rockfall hazard in Glenwood Canyon.
""Both assessments are taking place today. Rockfall has been reported and is likely due to burned vegetation no longer holding rocks in place,"" CDOT advised in a late morning press release.
T raffic is still advised to take detour routes to the south via U.S. 50, 24 and 285, and to the north via U.S. 40 and Colorado 139 or 13.
""CDOT has paused some construction projects to allow for detour traffic,"" according to the release.
Stay off Cottonwood and Independence passes
Cottonwood Pass between Garfield and Eagle counties was closed Tuesday morning after a semi overturned around 3 a.m. when the driver attempted to navigate the steep, narrow, dirt road.
Eagle County Emergency Management Director Birch Barron advised county commissioners in a morning briefing that when Cottonwood Pass reopens only smaller vehicles capable of maneuvering the tight roadway should attempt the route.
""And you can expect some serious traffic,"" he said.
CDOT says to avoid Cottonwood Pass altogether, except for local traffic only.
""CDOT asks that motorists not use Cottonwood Pass or Independence Pass as detour routes, as these roads are not built for heavy traffic or commercial oversize vehicles,"" CDOT said in its latest release.
Vehicles over 35 feet in length, including semi-tractor trailers, are prohibited on Independence Pass at any time. The restriction also includes a vehicle and trailer that, together, exceed 35 feet, CDOT advises.
UPDAT E 10:30 a.m. Tuesday -- More than 120 firefighters are now working the Grizzly Creek Fire, with more resources on the way, according to the latest update from the Upper Colorado Interagency Fire Management command.
""Firefighters are working to keep the fire out of the No Name drainage as well as on the north side of the Colorado River,"" according to the latest post. ""Terrain is very rugged, limiting where we can safely put firefighters on the ground.
""Crews are focusing on point protection in the No Name area on the west side, including accessing structures and prepping areas should the fire reach the area.""
The No Name area remains on pre-evacuation notice, and residents are asked to be prepared to leave in the event the fire moves in that direction.
Firefighting crews are also working on point protection in the Shoshone area to the east of the fire. Aircraft continues to be work the fire from above.
Firefighters are scouting areas for containment lines on top in the Flattops, and evacuating campers and other recreationists from the Coffee Pot Road area and other areas in the Forest Service closure area north of the fire.
The fire is still reported to be at 1,300 acres, but a more accurate acreage estimate was expected after a morning mapping flight.
""We expect fire activity to increase as the day warms and the humidity drops,"" according to the latest Facebook update.
The cause of the fire remains under investigation.GLENWOOD SPRINGS -- Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon is to remain closed in both directions between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum until further notice due to the Grizzly Creek firefighting efforts.
""We will have more information after morning briefings. We do not have an estimated time for reopening,"" according to a Tuesday morning post to the official incident Facebook page.
Regular fire updates will be posted there, and the latest on the I-70 closures and suggested alternate routes can be found at cotrip.org.
The Colorado Department of Transportation advises that the backcountry Cottonwood Pass dirt road is not to be used as a bypass. The I-70 closure is also intended to allow for inspection of the elevated westbound section where the fire burned, and to check for rockfall hazards within the fire area.
""The fire was active last night,"" the latest post announced. ""The community of No Name is under pre-evacuation, which means residents should be ready to evacuate.""
The fire started at about 1:30 p.m. Monday in the median between the eastbound and the elevated westbound lanes near the Grizzly Creek rest area and hiking trail, five miles east of Glenwood Springs. It involved about 60 firefighters and numerous aircraft.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

homeowners prepare property for wildfire

More than half of all Coloradans live in the wildland-urban interface, where homes and other structures
meet wildland vegetation, and are at some risk of being affected by wildfire.
The WUI includes more than homes in the forest. Homes adjacent to wildland fuels, even within
nonforested subdivisions, can burn during a wildfire due to ember showers. Colorado is primed to face
the same types of large, uncharacteristic wildfires as it did in 2020.
Below-average snowpack in the mountains and ongoing drought in Colorado could set the stage for
another challenging wildfireseason this year. An updated guide from the Colorado State Forest Service
can help residents prepare their home and property for wildfire with practical steps and guidance: The
Home Ignition Zone.
The Home Ignition Zone guide informs homeowners on how to address structures at risk and the area
around them. Wildfires play a natural role in Colorado's environment, and residents can increase the
likelihood their home survives a fire by minimizing the ability for it to ignite, in part by reducing nearby
fuels. Homeowners can complete a number of practical steps to protect their home and property from
wildfire. Start at your home and work your way out.
Address structural ignitability  including both flammable building materials and the risks posed by dead
pine needles on roofs or firewood stacked on or under decks  before doing anything else, then work
progressively outward by reducing fuels to create defensible space.
The ability of your home to survive a wildfire depends in part on the home ignition zone (HIZ), which
includes both the condition of the structure and the space immediately surrounding it. Think of embers
landing on and around your house, and not necessarily a wall of fire coming at it.
Fuels in the HIZ can include vegetation like trees, brush and grass, but when near homes, fuels also
include propane tanks, woodpiles, sheds and even homes themselves.
Maintaining the HIZ is not a one-time effort. After hardening your home and creating defensible space,
annual maintenance is essential to maintain effectiveness. An HIZ checklist is available in the new guide,
which includes tips like mowing tall grasses, pruning shrubs and clearing debris from roofs and gutters.
While maintaining the HIZ can help save your own home from wildfire, it also helps lower the risk of a
wildfirespreading to neighbors' property or surrounding land.
Coloradans are encouraged to review the guide and work to reduce their wildfire risk. As the guide
states, ""Firefighters always do their best to protect residents, but ultimately, it is your responsibility to
protect your property and investments from wildfire.""
The guide also can be a valuable resource for homeowners associations, fire departments, insurance
agents, local governments and others who work with residents and communities to reduce their wildfire
risk.
To get the guide, or for further assistance preparing for wildfires, contact your Steamboat Springs CSFS
field office at 970-879-0475, or download a digital copy from the CSFS website at
bit.ly/cohomeignitionzone.

Community Foundation distributes 670K for wildfire mitigatio.txt,"Community Foundation distributes $670K for wildfire mitigation
efforts

The Community Foundation of Northern Colorado has distributed $670,000 from the NoCoFires Fund to
help mitigate the impact of Colorado's largest wildfires, the Cameron Peak Fire and the East
Troublesome Fire.
The money comes from a designated fund that raised $750,000 to help combat fire impacts in the
Poudre and Big Thompson river watersheds.
Three nonprofit organizations received the distributions: Big Thompson Watershed Coalition, Coalition for
the Poudre River Watershed, and Wildlands Restoration Volunteers. Each of these nonprofits is active in
the recovery efforts, the foundation said in a written statement. Grants are helping with staff and material
costs incurred in environmental restoration.
""The grant committee has done an incredible job identifying nonprofits and projects that will benefit the
dozen communities in the burn scar and the hundreds of thousands of residents who depend upon the
Poudre and Big Thompson rivers for their water,"" Ella Fahrlander, chief engagement officer for the
Community Foundation, said in a statement. ""We're honored to provide funding, before federal dollars
become available, so these groups can get to work on reducing the fire's impact before the first monsoon
season. Heartfelt thanks to those individuals, businesses and foundations who contributed.""
Together, the two fires burned 400,000 acres of forest land, which in turn impacts water quality and river
health.
Mitigation experts estimate tens of millions of dollars will be needed to fully address the impacts to
wildlife, recreation, agriculture, and drinking water supplies for approximately 1 million people.

ST EAMBOAT SPRINGS -- It is winter in Colorado, and people are still talking about wildfire. The 2020 fire season was long and intense. The state's three largest wildfires, Cameron Peak, East Troublesome and Pine Gulch, combined to burn over a half-million acres. Forest conditions, such as age and insect and diseases, combined with climactic changes like drought, extreme weather events, higher temperatures, decreased snowpack and early thaw, have dramatically increased the stress on our forests. The snowpack this winter is generally below average in Northwest Colorado so far, so no one could be blamed for being a little anxious about the upcoming fire season.
These are clearly significant challenges, but we are nothelpless in the face of these changing conditions. There are three main factors that influence wildfires: weather, terrain and fuels. Fuels in this context mean the trees and other vegetation that make up our forests. We cannot do much about the weather or the terrain, but we can certainly address fuels.
Fuel reduction management approaches often involve salvage operations, which lower the fuel loading in strategic areas of our landscapes. Historic disturbance regimes once naturally reset these forests, allowing new cohorts of young, resilient trees to replace dead or decaying ones. Now, forest managers mimic these disturbances through active forest management treatments. T reated areas promote a younger age class to grow next to an area of older trees, thus creating a mosaic of mixed age classes. This diversity of age classes across the landscape improves the resiliency of the forest against large-scale disturbances. Although some disturbance occurs when managing forests, this impact is minimal compared to the damaging effects of a high intensity wildfire.
Cooperation across private, municipal, state and federal partners allow for forests to be treated and resilience to be improved across ownerships on a scale that can make a difference. The Colorado State Forest Service works with federal partners through the Good Neighbor Agreement to collaboratively approach these landscape level treatments. Multiple ownership projects have taken place across Routt County in the last few years.
Local forest product markets also are a driver of the quantity and scale of fuels treatments. While most harvested trees are still remnants of the mountain pine beetle outbreak of the 2000s, these standing dead trees still hold economic value -- but not for much longer. Local processing mills help drive how much of the landscape we can treat before it becomes too costly, while also sequestering carbon into forest products.
Landowners might want to use the winter and early spring months to evaluate their property and plan and prepare for the next fire season. Assumptions can be made as to what the upcoming fire season might look like as the snowpack is similar to what it was in January last year, compounding the effects of drought. Local agencies are great resources for mitigation and planning information to ensure your family is prepared for the upcoming season and beyond. Contact your local Colorado State Forest Service office or visit csfs.colostate.edu for the latest publications on wildfiresafety and mitigation.

The 2020 wildfireseason was another record breaker for Colorado. Routt County was surrounded by wildfires and was witness to incredible destruction in nearby Grand and Jackson counties. Fire is part of our environment, and we all are exposed to some risk no matter where we live. With a lower than average snow pack and the compounding effects of several years of drought on our soils and fuels, Colorado is gearing up for another active and long fire season, as we are, too, here in Routt County.
Wildfire mitigation begins with each one of us. To help our community understand the tools and resources available to reduce wildfire risk, the Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Council is hosting a virtual conference from 5 to 6:30 p.m. Thursday and running every Thursday evening through May. The conference will have local and regional experts present on steps that we all can take -- from the individual homeowner to our community stakeholders -- to mitigate risks and be better prepared in the face of a wildfire. The conference corresponds with Wildfire Awareness Month and follows the schedule below:
Thursday: Kickoff  Learning from 2020 to Prepare for Wildfire Season
T hrough a moderated conversation, our panel of expert stakeholders will discuss lessons learned from the 2020 fire season and how they are getting ready for this season. Dan Gibbs, executive director of the Department of Natural Resources and the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Conference keynote speaker, will provide us with a broader state level perspective and updates.
May 6: Home Ignition Zone & Ready, Set, Go  Being Prepared as an Individual Home or Ranch Owner
Wildfire mitigation starts with you as a landowner. This webinar will focus on what landowners can do to reduce wildfire risk around their property. Detailed information will be provided on the Home Ignition Zone/Defensible space concepts and how to get ready to evacuate in the event of a wildfire.
May 13: HOAs and Small Communities  Case Studies and Best Practices for Mitigation
No matter how prepared you are as a landowner, it is critical to address wildfire risks throughout your community. This webinar focuses on the concept of a fire adapted community (FAC) and what a community /HOA could do to reduce wildfire risk on a bigger scale. We will discuss the idea of a FAC and learn best practices from a local mitigation case study.
May 20: Community Lessons Learned  Preparedness and Recovery
Wildfire not only damages our homes but can impact critical community infrastructure and assets. This webinar will focus on wildfire preparedness and recovery across our entire community . Our presenters will address what can be done before a wildfire and the work that
comes after, reflecting on last year's fire season and some of those lessons learned.
This free event is an effort of the Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Council, with the generous support of the Steamboat Springs Board of Realtors, to promote public awareness and understanding of wildfire risk to foster community-driven action to reduce the risk and the impacts of wildfire in Routt County.

Wildfire may not be at the forefront of your mind these wintry and snowy days, but a quick peruse of the news finds that it is still in the headlines.
Millions of acres have burned, thousands of homes have been destroyed, and over two dozen people have perished due to wildfires in Australia. And it has only been a few months since the nearly 78,000 acre Kincade Fire ripped through Sonoma County in California.
The need to make communities more fire adapted is ubiquitous. Recognizing that wildfire is an ever-present concern, various stakeholders in Routt County came together to form the Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Council. The council will provide means to better address the wildfire mitigation needs at the county level, understanding Routt has different communities, with different vegetation types and priorities.
T hrough collaborative efforts, councils are formed to address the needs of a specific community or region. Most councils focus on facilitating fuels reduction at the neighborhood level, providing an outlet for mitigation information and education dissemination and facilitating multi-agency mitigation coordination. There are several other wildfire mitigation councils in the northwest area of Colorado that are serving as mentors to the Routt process.
This council is a product of the Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Roundtable and Conference held in Steamboat Springs in May 2019. During this conference resource professionals, county and city stakeholders and general public gathered to assess the wildfire mitigation needs of Routt County and provide information on fire mitigation and management. Information on existing councils was also presented which inspired a follow-up meeting to discuss the formation of a council locally.
The newly formed Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Council is composed of county and city representatives, local state and federal officials, nongovernmental organizations, homeowners associations as well as local businesses and private landowners.
The council is working on defining its mission and goals, as well as its governance and fiscal structure. The group will also be considering the local needs highlighted during the roundtable and conference, which included:
* A potential update of the Community Wildfire Protection Plan
* Addressing the build-up of fuels on private and public property
* The need to better educate county residents on the importance of home and community wildfire mitigation
* The need for a local outlet of information on mitigation and mitigation resources available
Watch for more information and activities from the Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Council in the months to come, especially when the green returns. For more information on the council and other natural resources management questions, contact the Steamboat Springs Field Office of the Colorado State Forest Service.

ST EAMBOAT SPRINGS -- The smoke plume of the Middle Fork Fire has reminded us all that the work to continue reducing the fire risk in our community is never done. When thinking about what actions you can take around your house and neighborhood to reduce fire risk, ithelps to frame those actions from the front door to the forest , with a combination of home hardening and defensible space.
Home hardening means modifying a structure to make it more resistant to ignition from direct flame contact or radiant and convective heat, as well as from burning embers that may fall on or near the home. Hardening creates a home that is less vulnerable to ignition without fire department intervention. This is important because, in a wildland-urban interface fire, there are never enough fire engines to protect every home.
Defensible space describes an area about 100 feet from the structure where combustibles have been removed or altered to reduce wildfire risk. The distance may be increased to 150 to 200 feet if the structure is in steep terrain.
The latest fire science tells us that embers are the primary cause of home ignitions. Structures are fuel, and if structures do not ignite, then houses and neighborhoods do not burn. There is an opportunity for direct action from landowners to help solve the problem by reducing home ignition potential. To do this, the recommendation is to use the zone approach:
1. Zone 1: The noncombustible zone: 0 to 5 feet from the structure and under the deck
a) Remove all combustibles and replace with non-combustible material, like rock or pavers.
b) Remove dead plant materials and regularly maintain within this zone.
2. Zone 2: 5 to 30 feet from the structure.
a) Maintain trees and shrubs in well-spaced groupings.
b) Remove ladder fuels and lower branches.
c) Regularly mow grass and weeds.
3. Zone 3: 30 to 100 feet from the structure
a) Create vegetation islands or groupings.
b) Remove lower branches and ladder fuels.
c) Maintain trees to provide adequate spacing of the crowns.
More specific examples of structure hardening include: Low cost * Focus on roofs and gutters by routinely removing debris. * Install window screens. * Remove vegetation and debris from decks. * Do not store combustible materials (firewood, lumber) under the deck. * Consider enclosing decks and installing non-combustible material under decks. * Enclose vents, soffits, and chimney or chimney/stovepipe openings with 1/8-inch metal mesh screening . * Install weather stripping around garage doors to stop embers from entering the garage, where combustible materials are often stored. * Install metal spacers between wood fences/gates and the structures they abut. * Ensure the start of exterior siding is a minimum of 6 inches above the ground. * Install a noncombustible barrier on fences that abut structures. Higher cost Install Class A fire -rated roofing. Replace decking and siding with ignition-resistant materials. Avoid untreated wood and vinyl siding. Replace single-pane windows with dual- or multi-pane windows, preferably with tempered glass. Replace combustible fences with noncombustible fences. Box in all open-eave construction. For any more questions on home hardening or defensible space, contact the Steamboat Springs Field Office of the Colorado State Forest Service at 970-879-0475.

ST EAMBOAT SPRINGS -- With the three largest wildfires in state history on the record in 2020, foresthealth has jumped to the forefront of our natural resource concerns. But what makes a healthy forest ?
Forests are dynamic, multi-functioning ecosystems that support a variety of species and processes. Forests, like all ecosystems, experience natural disturbance regimes, such as pests (like the mountain pine beetle), blow down events or wildfire. Human interaction and manipulation of the landscape has, in many instances, disrupted these natural processes in ways that we are still coming to understand. In some cases, it may be best to allow forests to return to their natural regime. In others, where there is human influence and/or specific management strategies, such as the wildland urban interface (WUI), continued management is needed to ensure compatibility between urban and wildland systems.
Foresthealth is complex but can be grouped into three main elements. The first of these is forest structure. The appropriate forest structure will depend on location, precipitation and forest type. Regardless of forest type, an appropriate balance of trees, openings and tree species diversity is crucial. The second component necessary for complex, functioning forest ecosystems is a robust and diverse understory.
Again, this is strongly influenced by forest type, but a vigorous understory will provide benefit to wildlife and pollinators as well as contributing to healthy soils and noxious weed abatement. The final consideration when discussing foresthealth is age class diversity. Having a forest with a variety of different age classes that are distributed in an appropriate way for the forest type makes the entire forest more resilient. Dead and dying trees are also an important component to the forest ecosystem as they provide excellent habitat for wildlife and slowly cycle nutrients back into the systems in their decay. Healthy and resilient forests are the culmination of these variables, which can reduce the chances of damage from pests and moisture stress, reduce catastrophic fire risk, improve wildlife and pollinator habitat, improve water quality and quantity, increase carbon storage and restore natural plant communities.
Improving foresthealth in heavily managed areas, such as WUIs, is important and often challenging. Community involvement in mitigation efforts is more important than ever. At this year's Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Conference, we will have local and regional experts present on steps that we all can take -- from the individual homeowner to our community stakeholders -- to mitigate risks and be prepared in the event of a wildfire. This community event will take place virtually beginning April 29 from 5 to 6:30 p.m. and running every Thursday evening through May. Visit routtwildfire.org for more information.

Snowslide Fire reported near San Isabel
SAN ISABEL -- Firefighters battled a small blaze on U.S. Forest Service land 1 mile southwest of San Isabel on Friday. The fire was sparked by lightning Thursday evening.
According to fire officials with the San Carlos Ranger District, the Snowslide Fire is located in very rugged terrain. Firefighters had to hike to the fire and a helicopter -- scooping water from Lake Isabel, made water drops to assist the five-person hand crew in fighting the blaze.

A community fundraising and planning effort similar to the one that resulted in ongoing restoration work after the 2018 Lake Christine Fire has launched with an eye on Glenwood Canyon and impacts from the Grizzly Creek Fire .
Roaring Fork Outdoor Volunteers (RFOV) has partnered with the Glenwood Springs Chamber Resort Association, the city of Glenwood and H2O Ventures, operator of the Hanging Lake hiking permit and shuttle system, and other groups to form the Glenwood Canyon Restoration Alliance.
It's one of three separate but cooperative fundraising efforts that are now underway, including a new fund established by the National Forest Foundation (NFF) and another through the Aspen Community Foundation.
Those efforts can work in concert to address not only environmental restoration and safety measures, buthealing for the community itself from the fire's impact, said Jacob Baker, communications and outreach coordinator with RFOV.
""The benefit of having volunteer- and community-led restoration is that everyone can heal together,"" Baker said. ""T aking part in a restoration effort is a form of participation and change ... to help renew expectations, understandings and create new mental images of the landscape.""
Those who want to participate financially can give to any one or more of the fundraising efforts; each of which has a different purpose, but any of which can benefit Glenwood Canyon restoration for many years to come, he said.
The RFOV funds will go exclusively toward Grizzly Creek Fire restoration, he said. That can include a variety of volunteer-based projects such as trail and infrastructure rebuilding, reseeding of the burn area and other projects based on volunteer ability.
The NFF funds that are raised can be used more broadly across the entire White River National Forest , but will largely be used for Grizzly Creek Fire mitigation efforts, said Roger Poirier, recreation staff officer for the White River Forest .
""We don't see these funds as being in competition,"" Poirier said. ""Our different partnerships do work in tandem to provide a bridge for the community to participate, and some different options for people to donate.""
NFF funds are important for the professional efforts that are needed to stabilize the fire burn area and help prevent potentially dangerous rockfalls and debris flows, especially in some of the heavily visited areas and along Interstate 70 as it passes through Glenwood Canyon. The NFF fund also charges a 15% administration fee.
Baker explained that Aspen Co mmunit y Foundation (ACF) funds go first to help with the human impacts of both the Grizzly Creek and the Pine Gulch Fire , which has been burning since late July in far western Garfield County northwest of DeBeque.
Secondarily, they can be used for restoration efforts, and ACF donations can also be earmarked for a specific purpose, he said.
Restoration of a natural landscape after a major fire is not something that happens in one or two years, Baker also explained. ""It's going to take probably 10 years,"" he said.
""After the Lake Christine Fire, we made a commitment to return multiple times every year for restoration projects there,"" Baker said.
Last year, some 300 volunteers were involved in a major reseeding effort on Basalt Mountain where the fire burned 12,500 acres. This year, volunteers returned to remove some invasive species and do some other restoration work, he said.
""The purpose of our restoration work is not to return the landscape to precisely how it was prior to the fire,"" he also explained.
That will be true of Glenwood Canyon, as well, which is a completely different environment than Basalt Mountain.
""People will see wildflowers that they've never seen before, and fungi that is new,"" Baker said. ""It will be changing in ways that can't be anticipated right now.""
For that reason, much of the actual planning for the restoration work won't likely happen until next year.
By contrast, the Grizzly Creek Fire is nearly three times the size of the Lake Christine burn area, at about 32,400 acres as of Friday. Access to much of the burn area within the canyon itself will also be next to impossible.
""For trees that were growing on 60-degree slopes, we're not going to replant those trees,"" Baker said. The risk assessment for volunteer crews will also be significantly more involved, he said.
And, because Glenwood Canyon, with popular attractions including the heavily visited Hanging Lake area, ""Fundamentally, the expectations will just be different,"" he said.
Initial assessments of Hanging Lake and the trail leading to it after the fire burned through that area is that the lake itself was not harmed and that the bridges and other trail infrastructure were not damaged.
RFOV had been planning its annual Hanging Lake work project to coincide with National Public Lands Day on Sept. 26. That will be postponed this year to plan for projects to be done next year once the needs are assessed, Baker said.
""The same will be true for the Grizzly Creek and No Name drainages,"" he said of two other popular hiking trails in Glenwood Canyon.
Fire restoration planning is also about community building and education, he added.
""We want to ensure that this is an inclusive process, so people can learn about restoration at the same time they participate in it,"" he said.

The Community Foundation of Northern Colorado has distributed $670,000 from the NoCoFires Fund to help mitigate the impact of Colorado's largest wildfires, the Cameron Peak Fire and the East Troublesome Fire.
The money comes from a designated fund that raised $750,000 to help combat fire impacts in the Poudre and Big T hompson river watersheds.
T hree nonprofit organizations received the distributions: Big T hompson Watershed Coalition, Coalition for the Poudre River Watershed, and Wildlands Restoration Volunteers. Each of these nonprofits is active in the recovery efforts, the foundation said in a written statement. Grants are helping with staff and material costs incurred in environmental restoration.
""The grant committee has done an incredible job identifying nonprofits and projects that will benefit the dozen communities in the burn scar and the hundreds of thousands of residents who depend upon the Poudre and Big T hompson rivers for their water,"" Ella Fahrlander, chief engagement officer for the Community Foundation, said in a statement. ""We're honored to provide funding, before federal dollars become available, so these groups can get to work on reducing the fire's impact before the first monsoon season. Heartfelt thanks to those individuals, businesses and foundations who contributed.""
Together, the two fires burned 400,000 acres of forest land, which in turn impacts water quality and river health.
Mitigation experts estimate tens of millions of dollars will be needed to fully address the impacts to wildlife, recreation, agriculture, and drinking water supplies for approximately 1 million people.

The Community Foundation of Northern Colorado has launched a fund to help restore watersheds damaged during recent forest fires.
The NoCo Fires Fund will contribute toward recovery of rivers and streams in the region, with the goal of raising $1 million. The Fort Collins-based Bohemian Foundation will match the first $250,000 donated to the fund, according to a press release. The Community Foundation will leverage that funding to secure additional private, state and federal resources.
""The investment we can make together in NoCoFires Fund will have positive impacts for decades,"" Bohemian Foundation executive director Cheryl Zimlich said in a prepared statement. ""This Community Foundation fund supports erosion control efforts that mitigate further degradation, as well as long-term restoration of vegetation and water quality. With this matching grant, we are standing with many generous Coloradans and the Community Foundation to help our region begin to heal.""
Mitigation in the Poudre River alone is expected to cost $50 million due to the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires, which burned more than 400,000 acres in Larimer and Grand counties.
The Colorado Department of Natural Resources is working with the Community Foundation in the effort. Dan Gibbs, executive director of CDNR, worked as one of 1,400 firefighters battling the Cameron Peak Fire .
""This was perhaps my most intense deployment in over 13 years,"" Gibbs said. ""The Cameron Peak wildfire burned some of our most pristine watersheds that will require both emergency protection and long-term restoration to protect our water supplies, mitigate flood threats, and preserve the outdoor economic engines Coloradans depend on. I'm grateful for the Community Foundation's support. These dollars fill a crucial need to support communities that are already experiencing economic stress by funding emergency protection efforts and assisting with local cost-shares that can leverage additional funding through recovery grants.""

As for economic goals, the plan outlines broad goals to develop green markets and consume goods with
lower carbon emissions.
Suiter said the plan is of utmost importance to Steamboat because air quality, clean water and health of
the Yampa River consistently rank as three of the biggest priorities for residents on the community
survey, which is sent to randomly-selected residents every three years and measures what is most
important to the community.
While the plan does not have numerical, tangible goals for accountability, council members and

Concerns Grow Over Implementation of States New Climate Rule.txt,"Concerns Grow Over Implementation of State's New Climate Rules
February 24, 2020  Westword (Denver, CO)
Author: Chase Woodruff Section: News 1002 Words
OpenURL Link
Two days after the release of a new analysis showing that Colorado is way off track on its new
greenhouse gas emissions goals, air-quality regulators from Governor Jared Polis's administration
unveiled their bold, aggressive plan to crack down onrefrigerators and air conditioners. Some of them.
Eventually.
At the monthly meeting of the state's Air Quality Control Commission on February 20, commissioners
formally voted to begin enacting two sets of greenhouse gas rules, with a final vote expected in May. The
first set will require stricter, more frequent reporting of emissions by major pollution sources, while the
second will gradually phase out the use of certain hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a type of greenhouse gas
commonly used in refrigerators, air conditioners and certain aerosols.
HFCs account for less than 1 percent of Colorado's greenhouse gas emissions annually, according to a
2019 report from state regulators  but for now, they're the only category of pollutant that the AQCC
plans on regulating as part of its new climate rules.
""Starting with HFCs  I've got to be honest, it's just utterly pathetic,"" says Jeremy Nichols, director of
the climate and energy program at environmental group WildEarth Guardians. ""That's what they're
coming out of the gate with? It's a drop in the bucket.""
Colorado lawmakers passed a sweeping package of climate legislation in 2019, formalizing a series of
greenhouse gas reduction targets and giving the AQCC and regulators at the Colorado Department of
Health and Environment broad authority to enact rules to help meet them.
Ten months later, however, the slow pace and narrow scope of the commission's climate rulemaking
process is leading to a growing sense of alarm among advocates  even relatively moderate
environmental groups. That's especially the case after the release of an independent analysis by
consulting firm M.J. Bradley and Associates on February 18, which found that Colorado is nowhere near
on track to meet its new statutory emissions goals.
Even under a favorable set of assumptions regarding new policies and market trends, the report
concluded, Colorado is only on pace to reduce its annual emissions by about 37 million tons of carbondioxide-equivalent (CO2e) by 2030, not the 62 million tons now required by state law. Following
publication of the report, more than fifty environmental and social-justice organizations signed a letter
urging the AQCC to take aggressive action to close this 25-million-ton ""emissions gap.""
""Our organizations may differ in our theories of change, membership, tactics, and even how we believe
we can close this emissions gap,"" the letter reads. ""However, we are united in our commitment to
meeting or exceeding the emissions goals and that the Air Quality Control Commission must take
immediate, urgent action to put Colorado on track to meet these goals. We have a critical window of
opportunity to make climate progress in Colorado a reality.""
The letter is significant in that its signatories include both hard-line anti-fracking groups like Colorado
Rising, which led the campaign for a failed 2018 ballot initiative calling for severe setback restrictions on
new oil and gas drilling, and more mainstream voices like the Environmental Defense Fund, which has
faced criticism for a stance on oil and gas development that some activists consider too
accommodating. As the February 20 AQCC meeting approached, a wide range of organizations agreed
to set their differences aside and send a unified message to the Polis administration: The state needs to
get more aggressive, fast.
""It's an unprecedented breadth and depth of alignment within the Colorado environmental community,""
Nichols says. ""I think it reflects how serious this is, and it also reflects an understanding that we need the
governor to step up and embrace this responsibility.""
""In just over a year, this administration is making important gains on our commitment towards
addressing climate change,"" a spokesperson for Polis says in a statement to Westword. ""We are over
two-thirds of the way to the 2025 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions [by 26 percent]. We are
excited about what else we can accomplish throughout the remainder of the Governor's term given that
we are off to a strong start.""
But several AQCC commissioners, too, have voiced concerns with the time frame of the rulemaking
process, particularly since it appears unlikely that the administration will move forward with major new
climate rules before the completion of a ""roadmap"" for emissions reductions currently being drafted by
the Colorado Energy Office. That report won't be finalized until September at the earliest, agency director
Will Toor told commissioners at the February 20 meeting.
""The intent of the roadmap,"" Toor said, ""is to take input from the public and the commission and others
on the strategies we should be evaluating, and then do a thoughtful, evidence-based modeling approach
to understand those strategies and come back with recommendations for further steps.""
It's not just environmental activists who are growing more concerned about climate policy  a poll
released on February 20 by Colorado College's State of the Rockies Project found that 70 percent of
Colorado voters see climate change as a ""serious problem,"" up from 63 percent in 2016. Similar
percentages of respondents told pollsters that they're concerned about the environmental impacts of oil
and gas development and support a transition to 100 percent clean energy.
Polis ran on a promise to put Colorado on a path to 100 percent renewable electricity generation by 2040,
and pledges by major electric utilities like Xcel Energy and Tri-State have put that goal within reach. But
reducing emissions from transportation, natural-gas heating and other sectors has proven much more
challenging, and analyses like the M.J. Bradley report cast doubt on whether the state's incremental,
market-based reforms will be enough to achieve its goals. With the clock ticking, activists say it's time
for regulatory bodies like the AQCC to begin flexing their muscles.
""They understand the problem,"" Nichols says of state officials. ""But I'm disappointed that the
administration is not driving more momentum and empowering the [AQCC] to rise to the challenge. The
buck stops with the governor, and the governor is not sending the right signals.""

Concerns_rises_over_Grizzly_Creek_Fires_impact_on__Aspen_Times_The_CO___August_26_2020.txt,"Co nce rns rise s o ve r Grizzly Creek Fire 's imp act o n - Asp e n T ime s, The (CO ) - August 26, 2020
Aug ust 26, 2020  Aspen Times, The (CO)  Heather Sackett Aspen Journalism
The Grizzly Creek Fire in Glenwood Canyon has many people praying for rain. But the very thing that could douse the blaze, which has burned 32,000 acres as of Tuesday, has some experts concerned it also could create problems for downstream endangered fish.
A heavy rain could wash dirt -- no longer held in place by charred vegetation -- and ash from the steep canyons and gullies of the burn area into the Colorado River. Scorched soils don't absorb water as well, increasing the magnitude of the flood. And the heavy sediment load in the runoff could suffocate fish. A similar scenario played out in 2018 when thousands of fish were killed by ash and dirt that washed into the Animas River from the 416 Fire burn area.
Downstream from the Grizzly Creek Fire , beginning in DeBeque Canyon, is critical habitat for four species of endangered fish: humpback chub, Colorado pikeminnow, bonytail and razorback sucker.
""Yes, we are very concerned about a fire in that kind of terrain that close to critical habitat. There's just no question,"" said Tom Chart, director of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program. ""There's a probability we could have an effect all the way down into the 15-mile reach.""
The Colorado River's so-called 15-mile reach, near Grand Junction, is home to those four species of fish. This stretch often has less water than is recommended for these fish by Fish & Wildlife mainly because of two large irrigation diversions that pull water from the river to irrigate Grand Valley farms: DeBeque Canyon's Grand Valley Project, which takes water from the river at a structure known as the Roller Dam, and the Grand Valley Irrigation Canal, which takes water from the river near Palisade.
Between these diversions and the confluence of the Gunnison River is a problem spot where water managers constantly work to bolster water levels through upstream reservoir releases. According to Chart, there is currently a total of about 250 cubic feet per second being released from Ruedi, Wolford and Granby reservoirs for the benefit of fish in the 15-mile reach.
With hot, dry weather, a weak monsoon season and the ongoing diversions for irrigation season, which continue into the fall, current river conditions are already stressful for the fish, Chart said. Water managers say they have seen fish using fish ladders to swim upstream and downstream of the 15-mile reach in search of deeper, cooler water.
""As far as concern about the ecological health of the 15-mile reach right now, we are very concerned about conditions there right now,"" Chart said. ""Native fish do move out of those dewatered stretches in search of better conditions.""
A debris flow on top of these already-challenging conditions could be devastating for fish populations.
""The potential with the Grizzly Creek Fire could be as bad as it gets if we get a rainstorm on top of a low baseflow,"" Chart said. ""You pray for rain, but at the same time this would be a tough time to get a flow of ash and retardant off the burned area.""
BURNED AREA ASSESSMENT S BEGIN
The U.S. Forest Service's Burned Area Emergency Response team has done a preliminary assessment of the severity of the soil burns to determine where debris flows would most likely occur, according to Lisa Stoeffler, deputy forest supervisor for the White River National Forest .
Areas of concern include Dead Horse Creek, Cinnamon Creek and No Name Creek, among others. More than an inch of rain in an hour -- or a quarter-inch in 15 minutes, as occurs in a fast-moving thunderstorm -- could trigger a debris flow, the BAER team found.
But this initial assessment, Stoeffler said, is mostly focused on potential impacts to Interstate 70, and water and power infrastructure, not on impacts to the aquatic environment.
""We may look at environment later on, once we have a final footprint of the fire,"" she said. ""The BAER process is really looking at things that we would need to address because it would cause an emergency-type situation.""
When the Grizzly Creek Fire first broke out, the city of Glenwood Springs switched its municipal water source from Grizzly and No Name creeks, which are near the burned area, to the Roaring Fork River.
""We are concerned about the ash and debris entering the water system and the costs we are going to incur because of this,"" said Hannah Klausman, public information officer for Glenwood Spring s.
SOLUT ION IS DILUT ION
Since preventing the dirty runoff from reaching the river would be difficult, if not impossible, in the steep, rocky terrain, the best bet, Chart said, would be tapping into upstream reservoir water to flush sediment and ash.
In other words: The solution to pollution is dilution.
The Roaring Fork River, which flows into the Colorado at Glenwood Springs, also would help dilute the ash and sediment before it got to the 15-mile reach. Some of it would probably settle out before it got there anyway. But that would do little to help native fish populations closer to the burn area. Although not listed as endangered, other species such as flannelmouth sucker, bluehead sucker and roundtail chub also could be impacted.
""We get concerned about the endangered fish the most, but it's really the entire native fish community we need to be paying attention to,"" Chart said.
The Colorado River Water Conservation District has some water in Wolford and Ruedi reservoirs
that could potentially be used for a flushing flow. But it would take careful coordination between reservoir operators. And it could be a complicated juggling act to figure out how to accommodate all the different demands for that limited water supply, said River District chief engineer John Currier.
""I think we stand ready to try and figure out how to do something,"" Currier said. ""It will be a topic of discussion sooner rather than later.""
Managing the impacts of the burned landscape on the fish will be ongoing long after the fire is exting uished.
""I think this is going to be an issue for years to come,"" Chart said. ""That landscape is going to take a long time to heal.""

Congressman Neguse plans launch of bipartisan wildfire caucu.txt,"Congressman Neguse plans launch of bipartisan wildfire caucus
December 27, 2020  Summit Daily News (CO)
Author: Sawyer D'Argonne sdargonne@summitdaily.com Section: Local 708 Words
OpenURL Link
Congressman Joe Neguse is spearheading the launch of a new bipartisan wildfire caucus next year in
hopes of raising awareness around the growing dangers of wildfires in Colorado and across the Western
United States.
Neguse, a Democrat representing Colorado's 2nd Congressional District, is co-chairing the new caucus
alongside Republican Congressman John Curtis of Utah, meant to provide a collaborative voice in the
Legislature to advocate for new wildfire-related programs on a national scale. Officials are planning to roll
out the group during the 117th United States Congress in January.
The move comes on the back of the worst wildfireseason in Colorado's history, in which the state saw
its three largest recorded wildfires ever. This year, almost a half-million acres burned in Colorado's 2nd
Congressional District alone, which includes Summit, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Gilpin, Grand, Larimer,
and portions of Boulder, Eagle, Jefferson, Park and Weld counties.
""It signals the need to take this seriously, and to engage in some robust and candid conversations about
what comes next,"" Neguse said.
Neguse said the caucus would advocate for new wildfire-related programs that include funding for
prevention and mitigation efforts, along with disaster relief for impacted communities.
There is a dedicated push to make the caucus bipartisan, requiring that new members join in equal
numbers from across the political aisle in hopes of putting politics aside and focusing on the science.
""We believe this caucus can help turn down the temperature of our politics so that we can depoliticize
these critical issues that matter to the people I represent, the people Congressman Curtis represents,
and ultimately the American people writ at large,"" Neguse said. ""Forest management has become highly
politicized, as has climate change, the consequences of climate change, and the need for our federal
government to address that in a systematic and comprehensive way.  Part of the goal of this is for me
and my fellow co-chair to lend our respective political capital to making the case on both fronts with our
colleagues in the House Democratic Caucus and the House Republican Caucus.""
Neguse said there has already been considerable interest from lawmakers around the Western United
States, and that caucus members will be working closely with other federal agencies like the U.S. Forest
Service, Bureau of Land Management and others to develop a road map to help communities better
support firefighter operations, new technologies, wildfire mitigation efforts, relief funds and more.
With a road map in place, officials will begin prioritizing new legislative and regulatory work to start
making concrete changes.
""I expect to see some results within the first six months of the caucus' existence,"" Neguse said. ""There's
something to be said about having a venue in which we can have thoughtful, candid conversations about
prioritization of some of these issues. But at the end of the day the goal is to create a consensus we'd
like to see the administration pursue, and ultimately introduce legislation that addresses some of those
challenges signed into law by President-elect Biden.""
Neguse said that continuing the caucus into future congressional sessions was another goal, but that it
would be dependent on demonstrating that it has made a difference. Both Neguse and Curtis have
voiced optimism that the development of the caucus would make a lasting impact on communities
around the west faced with the threat of wildfires.
The bipartisan wildfire caucus is at least the third wildfire-related project that Neguse and Curtis have
worked on together. Earlier this year Neguse and Curtis co-sponsored the Study on Improving Lands Act
and the Wildfire and Community Health Response Act, which focused on studying the impacts of
wildfires on soil and mitigating wildfire risk during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively.
""Utahns know the destruction that wildfires leave in their wake and the importance of commonsense
forest management that can save lives and property,"" Curtis said in a news release. ""During my time in
Congress, improving wildfire mitigation, response, and recovery efforts has been a top priority, and I am
committed to creating a diverse coalition of stakeholders to work towards stopping preventable
disasters. Congressman Neguse and I share the unfortunate experience of seeing firsthand how
devastating wildfires are to the land and surrounding communities and, because of that, also share a
commitment to working across the aisle to find way to protect our communities and ensure they quickly
bounce back after a fire.""

After climbing the twists and turns of a narrow dirt road that wound around the wooded hilltops of Jamestown, U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse stepped from an off-road vehicle and strapped on a hard hat to meet with disaster relief volunteers with Team Rubicon.
Saturday's visit was one of several stops Neguse, who represents Colorado's 2nd District, made as part of a tour across Boulder County to discuss legislative efforts. After serving at a Sister Carmen Co mmunit y Center food drive, the Lafayette Democrat visited with volunteers in the mountains. Neguse made his final stop at the T able Mesa Shopping Center in Boulder to talk with business owners about the challenges they've faced in the wake of the pandemic and the March 22 mass shooting at King Soopers in the shopping center, which left 10 people dead.
In a hillside Jamestown neighborhood, volunteers with Team Rubicon, a veteran-led nonprofit group, worked to thin the forest and remove debris to help mitigate future wildfires. Victoria Gaulrapp, Team Rubicon Boulder area communications coordinator, said there were roughly 100 volunteers assisting in the projects. Saturday marked the second weekend of work, with Team Rubicon returning next Friday, Saturday and Sunday to complete more projects.
""It's incredible to have the folks in our community step up and help each other doing this mitigation work in advance of what we know will be another very difficult fire season,"" Neguse said. ""It underscores the real need for us to take action in Congress in terms of scaling up these efforts and investing in the necessary resources, for example, through our civil conservation corps.""
Neguse has proposed the creation of a 21st Century Conservation Corps. The corps could create hundreds of thousands of jobs and would invest billions in forest reforestation, wildfire resiliency and watershed mitigation efforts, according to a news release from Neguse's office.
The idea behind the corps is to re-create something similar to Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program and the 1930 Civilian Conservation Corps, which built Red Rocks, roads, trails and campgrounds in Rocky Mountain National Park, according to the release.
As he surveyed the work Saturday, Neguse said the proposal would support mitigation efforts, like the ones seen Saturday, across the state.
The proposal was introduced more than a year ago.
""It's gained a lot of momentum since, culminating in President Biden including it as part of the American Jobs Act proposal. Our hope is we can see this get across the finish line in June or July,"" Neguse said.
In the subdivisions near Mountain Ridge Place and Foothills Ranch Drive just west of U.S. 36, Team
Rubicon volunteers worked in an area decimated by the Calwood Fire. The wildfire -- the county's largest, which sparked in October and destroyed 10,105 acres and 27 properties. T wenty-one homes in the Mountain Ridge and Foothills Ranch communities were destroyed by the blaze, according to a Team Rubicon news release.
Among a team of soot-covered volunteers surrounded by blackened trees, Dave LaRivee , an Air Force veteran and a team lead, said they were felling trees and working to rehabilitate and prevent erosion of the hillside.
""We're trying to make it safe so that the homeowners can come back and rebuild,"" he said.
LaRivee said he was glad Neguse got to see volunteers in action.
""I know he's trying to raise money for fire mitigation and recovery efforts,"" LaRivee said.
For his part, Neguse said he was in awe of the work he observed.
""Many of these folks doing this work are first responders and our nation's veterans, and we owe them a debt of gratitude already,"" Neguse said.
T able Mesa business owners share challenges
Back in Boulder, Neguse sat among the chatter of people enjoying their brunch outside the South Side Walnut Cafe in the T able Mesa Shopping Center. He talked with business owner Xanthe Thomassen about challenges the restaurant has seen throughout the pandemic.
Thomassen said the Walnut Cafe, which was founded by Dana Derichsweiler -- Thomassen's wife, will survive the pandemic, but not completely unscathed. In July last year, challenges from the pandemic forced the couple to close the Super Mini Walnut Cafe in Lafayette.
Today, she said one of the restaurant's biggest hurdles is finding enough workers to fill positions.
Thomassen had good news to share with Neguse on Saturday, though. She said the restaurant was among those that received a Restaurant Revitalization grant through the American Rescue Plan -- part of a stimulus package passed by Congress to help address the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
While she declined to say how much the Restaurant Revitalization grant was for, Thomassen said it will help provide more security for the restaurant and its future. For the restaurant, which employs roughly 62 people in full- and part-time positions, it will mean more funds for employees and potentially some restaurant upgrades, like better equipment.
In the backdrop of the weekend hum at the T able Mesa Shopping Center on Saturday were signs of efforts to recover, following the March 22 mass shooting at the shopping center's King Soopers store. Signs that read ""Boulder Strong"" hung on windows of businesses, and the chain-link fence that bordered the grocery store remained packed with flowers, signs and messages to the victims.
""The community is healing,"" Thomassen said. ""But, there's a long ways to go. People have PT SD. My wife had to be here that whole weekend opening, and people were crying. She was absorbing it and realizing that she needs to be focused on her mental health as well.""
Boulder Mayor Pro T em Junie Joseph and Boulder Councilmember Aaron Brockett were among those who joined the Saturday conversation.
""Of course, it's been an incredibly hard time with COVID-19, but then add in the tragedy of the shooting on top of it -- these businesses need our support so much,"" Brockett said.

On Tuesday, July 20, Congressman Joe Neguse, Chairman of the U.S. Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands will hold a hearing to discuss his proposal to enact a 21st Century Climate Conservation Corps.
The hearing begins at 3pm ET /1pm MTon Tuesday July 20th and can be viewed here.
""In the face of multiple challenges that our communities in Colorado are facing: unemployment, catastrophic wildfires and climate change, our 21st Century Climate Conservation Corps proposal will bring in essential resources to put Coloradans back to work, restore our lands and our communities,"" said Congressman Joe Neguse. ""As Chair of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, I'm excited to bring this innovative proposal before my Subcommittee. We have a historic opportunity to make bold investments in our public lands, clean energy and climate resiliency, all while creating good-paying jobs, building a diverse workforce and strengthening career pathways. The urgency of this moment recalls past chapters of national mobilization, and in standing up the Climate Conservation Corps, we will build on that legacy and existing infrastructure to meet the challenges of today.""
Among the witnesses for tomorrow's hearing is Scott Segerstrom, Executive Director of the Colorado Youth Corps Association.
""A Civilian Climat e Corps program, built on the shoulders of the conservation service corps network, has the potential to employ thousands and protect millions,"" said Scott Segerstrom, Executive Director of the Colorado Youth Corps Association. ""Public-private partnerships with corps represent the best of government: channeling resources into an efficient, proven solution that will be of service to all Americans. Dedicated funding through the CCC will mobilize corps around the country to graduate thousands of firefighters to grow our nation's capacity. With CCC investments in corps, we CAN do this.""
Ahead of the hearing, Chair Neguse will hold a press conference with bicameral leaders on this issue to urge House and Senate leaders to incorporate the proposal in the reconciliation package.
B ackg round
Congressman Joe Neguse's 21st Century Conservation Corps Act would tackle multiple challenges simultaneously, addressing unemployment rates caused by COVID-19, tackling western wildfires, restoring our lands and communities and addressing climate change.
The plan would take a page out of FDR's New Deal program to recreate the corps of the 1930s, which built Red Rocks, roads, trails and campgrounds in Rocky Mountain National Park and supported other projects throughout Colorado. Neguse's proposed 21st Century Civilian Climat e Corps would reimagine this program, put hundreds of thousands of Americans back to work in the wake of the COVID-19 economic crisis, and make major investments in wildfire resiliency,
mitigation and adaptation. The plan additionally would support Colorado's outdoor recreation industry and address outdoor access by investing in the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Program and Every Kid Outdoors Program.
Given record-breaking wildfires across Colorado in 2020, including the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome Fires, two of the largest in state history, historic investments to address future wildfires are crucial. The proposal from Congressman Neguse would invest in programs that have previously benefited Colorado's wildfiresuppression efforts, such as the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, and Firewise and would hire and train a new generation of workers to support forest management, wildland fire suppression and wildfire recovery.

Connecting_the_dots_Dry_cycles_drought___Gazette_The_Colorado_Springs_CO___September_15_2020.txt,"Co nne cting the do ts: Dry cycle s, dro ught, - Gaze tte , The (Colorado Springs, CO ) - Se p te mbe r 15, 2020
September 15, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  BILL BANKS
Did you notice Mother Nature has been stingy in the Pikes Peak region when it comes to rain? In fact, U.S. Drought Monitor data reveal that El Paso County and T eller County are in moderate drought while Pueblo County is in severe drought. These worrisome drought conditions bring increased wildfire risk.
Part of the Fountain Creek Watershed Flood Control and Greenway District's mission to provide a safe and environmentally functional waterway is to provide information on drought to keep our community informed of fire risk.
According to the U.S. Forest Service, the wildfire outlook has worsened in recent decades. The wildfireseason lasts longer, fires tend to be larger and fire behavior is more extreme.
One explanation is the concept of naturally occurring wet and dry cycles. Unfortunately, we are in an extended DRY cycle. In the book ""New Mexico 2050,"" ecologist Craig D. Allen, PhD explains that the Southwest was relatively wet between the 1970s and 1990s and that the current dry spell began in the late 1990s. These phases are driven by heat patterns in the Pacific Ocean and are visible in the tree-ring record going back for centuries.
How is our watershed impacted by wildfires?
Knowing that we're in an extended dry cycle is especially alarming, considering how severely wildfires can impact our watershed:
Less vegetation in a burn area can reduce snowpack conditions, resulting in faster and earlier runoff.
The soil in a burn area can become hydrophobic -- it actually repels water
These conditions increase surface runoff and erosion, which can lead to mudslides, flash floods and debris flows that dump soil and rocks into streams and reservoirs.
Increased carbon, manganese, and fire retardant enter streams, which decreases water quality.
Our watershed has been impacted by the two most destructive fires in Colorado.
Wikipedia presents a ""List of Colorado Wildfires,"" detailing the largest and most destructive wildfires in Colorado since 1924. In the last decade, our region earned the unfortunate distinction of experiencing the two most destructive fires on record in Colorado.
The 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire scorched more than 18,000 acres, resulting in two fatalities, and the loss of 346 structures and was, up to that point, the most destructive fire in Colorado since 1924. Also, within days of fire containment, heavy rains coupled with unstable soil conditions resulted in
devastating flash floods.
Just one year later, in 2013, the Black Forest Fire burned more than 14,000 acres. This tragic wildfire claimed the lives of two people and destroyed 511 structures, and it now ranks as Colorado's most destructive fire since 1924.
Your wildfire mitigation efforts can help our watershed.
Improving the health of our waterways benefits us all by ensuring a high standard of water quality and excellent stormwater management. Simultaneously, this creates recreational opportunities and improves natural habit for wildlife. Each of us can reduce the danger of fire -- and its impact on our watershed -- by taking these wildfire risk reduction steps, presented by Firewise USA:
1. Home ignition zone Learn how to protect your home in the three ignition zones (immediate, intermediate, and extended).
2. Landscaping and maintenance
Prune tree branches six feet up the tree and around your home and remove bushes containing resins, oils, and waxes.
3. Roofing and vents
To prevent ember entry, repair loose or missing shingles and put recommended screens on roof and attic vents. Consider replacing roofs with Class A fire rated shingles.
4. Decks and porches
Remove vegetation and debris. Never store flammable materials such as propane tanks and firewood under decks and porches or near your house.
5. Siding and windows Ideally, your home is constructed of fire-resistant siding such as brick, fibercement, plaster, or stucco. When it's time to replace windows, choose dual-pane tempered glass.
6. Emergency
responder access
Is your house number clear and easy to read, even in the dark? If not, spending a few minutes on this task can save lives and property.
7. Ready, set and go
Pay attention to fire conditions and be prepared with an evacuation plan.
Bill Banks is the executive director of the Fountain Creek Watershed Flood Control and Greenway District. The District was established in 2009, to manage, administer and fund capital
improvements necessary to maintain critical infrastructure and improve the watershed for the benefit of everyone in the Fountain Creek watershed.

Conservation groups disapprove BLMs oil and gas plan.txt,"Conservation groups disapprove BLMs oil and gas plan
April 16, 2020  Delta County Independent (CO)
Author: Lisa Young Section: News 946 Words

By Lisa Young
Staff writer
The Bureau of Land Management released its Uncompahgre Field Office Resource Management Plan
April 10 to the dismay of conservationist groups in Delta County's North Fork Valley.
Local conservation organizations say the plan could open up 95% of the public lands in the region to oil
and gas development, threatening local farmers and businesses in the valley. A number of North Fork
citizens and supporters have opposed unrestrained oil and gas drilling for years. The BLM measure is
estimated to affect the use of public lands across nearly 1.7 million acres of mountains, woodlands and
red-rock deserts for decades to come.
According to a press release from the Western Slope Conservation Center, the most disheartening
aspect of the BLM plan is that it undermines years of collaboration among local environmentalist groups
while disregarding an alternative plan created by citizens who live, work and enjoy the valley.
In 2014, concerned stakeholders put together the North Fork Alternative Plan calling for a balanced
approach to regulated energy development in the region. The homegrown plan allowed the usage of up to
25% of federal lands while keeping important protections for hunting, fishing and other outdoor recreation
activities in the region. They say the BLM plan ""ignores this community proposal, and in turn, dismisses
the community's own vision for a sustainable future and environment.""
Patrick Dooling, WSSC executive director, calls the plan a triple threat which ""ignores a decade's worth
of community input, it undermines our economic future, and it endangers the very public lands and
waters that our local farms, ranches, vineyards, and recreation businesses depend on.""
Dooling said the BLM plan and Trump administration clearly disrespects the best interests of the North
Fork community during a time of unprecedented global crises.
""As Colorado's Western Slope residents and the rest of the country battle with a national emergency, the
BLM is charging ahead to open lands that aren't essential for the country's oil and gas resources. Kicking
our small businesses and communities while they're down is just plain shameful,"" Dooling said.
The final BLM plan is viewed as ""political maneuvering by the Trump administration to impose its ""energy
dominance"" agenda on Colorado, according to the WSCC. They say recently released documents by
Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) obtained through the Freedom of Information
Act show Trump administration officials at the national BLM office overruled local agency staff and
ignored local public input in order to ""align the preferred alternative with administration priorities"" such as
deregulation of the oil and gas industry at a time when the BLM is relocating its headquarters from
Washington, D.C., to Grand Junction.
Outspoken environmentalist Natasha Lger, Citizens for a Healthy Community executive director,
blasted the BLM's plan for ignoring state law on climate change.
""It makes no climate, ecological or economic sense to drill in the North Fork Valley,"" she said. ""This is
exactly the type of federal action that is responsible for accelerating climate and environmental
degradation, which cannot be allowed to stand if we have any hope of protecting present and future
generations, rare and irreplaceable ecosystems like the North Fork, and meeting Colorado's goals for a
clean and renewable energy future.""
Lger said the BLM plan ignores 42,000 public comments in opposition, as well as problems identified by
her organization's July protest. She said the BLM refused to consider alternatives to curb fossil-fuel
leasing and failed to analyze how expanding fracking and drilling could harm organic agriculture, the
climate and endangered species like the Colorado pikeminnow and Gunnison sage grouse.
Conservation groups are asking the BLM to redo its environmental impact statement and support a plan
that recommends no new leasing. In addition, area conservation leaders say ""the plan fails to protect
public health, provide ecological well-being, or promote a sustainable rural economy on Colorado's
Western Slope.""
At a time when small businesses are shutting their doors and communities are asking visitors to stay
away due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the group says the Trump administration ""should not be barreling
forward with land use planning that harms the North Fork community and environment.""
Realtor Patti Kaech said the region has been able to diversify its economy away from fossil fuel
development after two coal mines closed. She said the local real estate markets were thriving prior to
COVID-19 and real estate sales have been holding steady with buyers closing on properties prior to the
statewide lockdown.
""With this impending plan, the BLM is sending our community backwards, setting us up to be at the
whims of the oil and gas industry development and threatening the local economy. At a time when we
can't even show homes or hold open houses due to COVID-19, the release of this plan feels like salt in
the wound,"" Kaech said.
BLM began revising the final plan in 2010 meant to oversee activities and development in the
Uncompahgre Field Office (UFO) planning area for the next two decades. Those plans, say
environmentalists, will open the entirety of the North Fork Valley to oil and gas leasing and development.
With doors wide open, many in the recreation and tourism industry also fear setbacks.
""Right now, we have the opportunity to bolster a sustainable and long term recreation industry in the
Lower Gunnison watershed. We have the wildlands, the community, and the ambition needed to develop
and maintain a strong recreation sector of the local economy. Turning the valley into a short term oil and
gas haven is not compatible with this local vision. The BLM must listen to the communities who will be
most affected by this decision,"" said Sven Edstrom, Delta Area Mountain Bikers.
Many North Fork citizens, conservation and environmental groups worry that new oil and gas leases
could begin as early as December 2020.

Could an insurancepremium fee prevent Colorados next big.txt,"Could an insurance-premium fee prevent Colorado's next big
natural disaster? - Bill would distribute money to communities for
mitigation projects
March 27, 2021  Durango Herald, The (CO)
Author: Lucy Haggard; The Colorado Sun Section: Local News 789 Words
OpenURL Link
When the Camp Fire ripped through Paradise, California, in 2018, killing dozens of people and destroying
hundreds of structures, Lisa Cutter knew her Colorado community could be next.
The Democratic state representative's district includes Evergreen and Conifer, two towns at risk of
experiencing a devastating wildfire.
""People in the wildland urban interface are scared,"" Cutter said. ""They're terrified.""
Rather than wait for a disaster to hit, Cutter wants to spend more money up front to prevent one from
happening in the first place. Enter House Bill 1208, which seeks to create a state-run natural disaster
mitigation enterprise fund that would help communities finance necessary work to lessen or prevent
future catastrophes.
Money for the initiative would come from a fee paid by insurance companies on natural disaster policy
premiums, such as those for fire and crop failure. Cutter said charging insurance companies  $1.25 per
every $1,000 in premiums, with an annual increase based on U.S. Department of Labor indexes  is an
""elegant"" approach because it's in the best interest of companies, not just the interest of those who are
insured, to mitigate disaster.
Unlike funding allocated through the state Legislature or Congress, the enterprise would have a
consistent, predictable amount of money filling up its coffers, proponents say. The bill's fiscal note
estimates it would bring in about $7.6 million in its first year, $7 million of which would go directly to
grants, after deducting administrative costs.
Premiums would likely go up as insurance companies pass the new costs on to consumers, but Cutter
estimates it would be less than $5 more a year for the average homeowner.
Grants under the legislation would be intended for mitigation and prevention projects, not responding to
active disasters or recovering from previous ones. But the line between these categories can easily blur,
said Jacob Smith, executive director of Colorado Communities for Climate Action, which has worked
closely with the bill's prime sponsors.
In the case of wildfires, for instance, scorched soils can lose their stability, setting up prime conditions for
a mudslide later on.
""It just amplifies,"" Smith said. ""Those challenges get more intense and more damaging every year, and
they completely build on each other.""
While the projects must be mitigation-oriented, the bill's text is left intentionally vague, said Cutter, so
communities can figure out how best to go about the work. One example: She's been asked if a grant
could fund youth corps groups that do forestry work to mitigate wildfires. She thinks that's a reasonable
option.
""We want to see local communities going, 'what's the best way, who can I work with, who can I partner
with, what can I do to leverage these funds to the best of our ability and get the most out of this
opportunity for additional funding?'"" Cutter said.
The legislation would create a board to dole out grants, with representatives from a variety of interests
and geography, including state agencies, environmental justice advocates, local governments, scientists
and the insurance industry. The Colorado Department of Public Safety's executive director would appoint
each of the 11 board positions.
The $7 million generated by the legislation may seem like lot of money, but it's a fraction of the $285
million cost to suppress wildfires in 2020, as estimated at a recent Joint Budget Committee hearing. And
that figure doesn't include insured losses, recovery costs and other general economic impacts.
Glenwood Springs alone is spending $10 million to repair and upgrade its water infrastructure after last
year's Grizzly Creek Fire, and other communities are also looking at high price tags.
""(The bill is) certainly not enough to solve the problem, but it is another chunk of funding that becomes
available,"" Smith said. ""It's really enabling local communities to do what they feel the most important
projects are.""
As climate change exacerbates natural disasters, Cutter said it's too easy to get caught in the cycle of
responding as they happen, rather than trying to prevent them altogether, or at least lessen their severity.
And while it would be easier to have one single source of money to address these issues, that doesn't
exist, so she'll take what she can get.
""I think we need to have every tool in the box,"" Cutter said, ""and this is just another option.""
House Bill 1208 passed the House Energy and Environment Committee by an 8-4, party-line vote. It now
heads to the House Finance Committee for another hearing.

The snow is still falling in the San Juan Mountains, but within weeks snowmelt will be swelling the
Uncompahgre River and its tributaries. The river that runs through Ouray, Ridgway, Montrose, Olathe
and Delta will reach its maximum flows between May and July. And this year, the person who comes
closest to predicting the date and time of the Uncompahgre River's peak flow will win a prize package
worth $1,228, if they enter the inaugural Uncompahgre River Classic.
To raise money to fund its watershed protection activities, the Uncompahgre Watershed Partnership
(UWP) launched the Uncompahgre River Classic in March. Until May 10, peak flow prediction entry
forms can be purchased for $5 per prediction or $20 for six predictions. Then, the peak flow is expected
to happen between May 11 and July 10, based on the last 10 years of data, so the winning entry will be
announced on July 11.
""We are surrounded by opportunities to enjoy the offerings of our watershed, in an area which boasts
some of the most spectacular scenery in the world,"" said Uncompahgre River Classic Coordinator
Pamela Cannalte.
""The Uncompahgre Watershed Partnership's mission is to protect our watershed's high-quality natural,
scenic and economic values, which are critical for our community, through monitoring, education and
restoration. The plants and animals surrounding the river and canyons would not thrive and be as
beautiful as they are if our rivers are unhealthy.""
Besides fundraising, the purpose of the contest is to educate people about the river's seasonal changes.
UWP usually holds the Ridgway RiverFest to raise money and awareness about watershed issues and
celebrate the Uncompahgre River at the end of June, but the 2021 festival has been postponed to August
The winner of the Uncompahgre River Classic will receive a grand prize package with a Ouray Via
Ferrata experience for up to four people guided by Basecamp Ouray ($700 value), a two-night stay at
Ridgway Lodge & Suites ($428 value), and a $100 gift certificate for dinner at Four Corners Restaurant &
Sky Bar in Chipeta Solar Springs Resort. The second prize winner will receive a Patagonia 40L Duffel
Bag from RIGS Fly Shop & Guide Service ($129 value), and the third prize winner will receive four
soaking passes to Orvis Hot Springs ($88 value).
""Our river faces threats of many kinds, from development and pollution to climate change and drought.
For those who think that small actions in supporting our nonprofit won't make a difference, think again
By purchasing an entry into our fundraiser, the Uncompahgre River Classic, you will join us to
collectively and positively improve the health of our river,"" said Cannalte.
Information and registration for the Uncompahgre River Classic is at

County approves climate resolution moving toward climate act.txt,"County approves climate resolution, moving toward climate action
plan
September 22, 2020  Canyon Courier, The (Evergreen, CO)
Section: Local News 403 Words
OpenURL Link
Climate is in crisis.
In a 2-1 vote, the Board of County Commissioners on Sept. 15 agreed to acknowledge the global climate
crisis and to move forward with a climate-action plan that will develop goals, policies and programs to
reduce the county's greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.
Now that the idea has been approved, a climate-action team will be developed to pursue grants and other
funding sources and to determine the scope of the project and a cost estimate. The process is expected
to continue until next summer when the plan would be drafted and published, and the team could
continue with implementation and monitoring of the various goals and targets.
Commissioner Libby Szabo voted against the proposal, not because she didn't support the efforts but
because she felt it wasn't as custom-made for Jeffco as it should be.
""I would like to see something a little more tailored to Jefferson County,"" Szabo said.
""Jefferson County cannot carry the burden of the world's problems,"" she added.
Although the resolution does acknowledge the global risk and references a number of reports and
agreements, including the November 2018 National Climate Assessment, it also notes impacts specific
to Jefferson County and Colorado. These include prolonged drought, elevated wildfire risk, air pollution,
more extreme heat and more.
The resolution also references some of the work that's already been done by the county. Jeffco created
a sustainability coordinator position, developed a sustainability program and improved energy efficiency
in the county buildings.
Szabo worried that alternative energy efforts could mean higher energy costs for Jefferson County's
lower-income constituents.
Commissioner Casey Tighe agreed with that notion but touted the work of Golden's National Renewable
Energy Laboratory, which specializes in renewable energy and energy efficiency research and
development.
Tighe and Commissioner Lesley Dahlkemper ultimately voted in favor of the climate measure.
""In my mind, this effort is long overdue,"" Dahlkemper said.
Several community members spoke in favor of the initiative during public comment at the hearing. JJ
Trout, a member of Golden City Council, said passing the resolution is the first step.
Richard Crane, who serves on the board of the Evergreen Alliance for Sustainability, agreed with Trout.
""I think (the resolution is) forward looking and needs to happen for us,"" he said.
""Forests are a big deal to us up in Evergreen,"" Crane added. ""We're concerned about those forests and
the effects of climate change  from warmer summers to warmer winters.""

The organizing committee for the Routt County Climate Action Plan is asking for community member comments regarding the proposed strategies, actions and tactics of the plan through this weekend before the final draft moves on to municipal leaders later this month.
The fundamentals of the plan are available to view at RouttClimateAction.com/the-plan and explained under the six sectors of energy, transportation, land use, waste, accountability and economics.
The underlying goal of the CAP, if all plan recommendations are implemented, would be to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across Routt County by 74% by 2050 from the baseline of the community's 2018 greenhouse gas inventory, said CAP consultant Julia Newman, senior associate with Lotus Engineering & Sustainability in Denver. Each of the six sectors for climate change mitigation efforts have three or four strategies with up to eight recommended actions per strateg y.
During a hybrid online and in-person meeting Monday afternoon with approximately 40 attendees, Newman explained the CAP process began in March 2020 in collaboration with a local four-person project management team and a larger oversight committee, including an elected official or key staff member from each partnering agency.
Despite COVID-19 pandemic complications barring in-person charrettes, the consultants conducted an initial survey to gather insight on community priorities and hosted various online stakeholder focus groups.
Scott Cowman, Routt County environmental health director and spokesman for the CAP, said organizers moved the CAP forward to take advantage of state and federal funds for climate action plans.
""We are well positioned to take advantage of state and federal resources that are anticipated to become increasingly available in the near future,"" Cowman said. ""There will be proposed financial commitments on the part of the county and municipalities that will be considered on an annual basis by elected officials as a part of the budget process.""
Routt County and the municipalities of Steamboat Springs, Hayden, Oak Creek and Yampa are all partners in the CAP.
Cowman said the impacts of climate change are apparent in Routt County, ranging from diminished stream flows to high intensity wildfires affecting air quality to the 2-degree average increase in temperature in Colorado in the past 30 years.
""All have the potential to affect our health, economy and way of life,"" Cowman said.
Steamboat Springs City Council and the Routt County Board of Commissioners will discuss the CAP's final draft during a joint workshop at 5 p.m. May 18 with both online Zoom and limited inperson attendance available. The final plan will be released in June. Then the CAP will need to be approved this summer by the commissioners and the municipal councils, according to Winnie DelliQuadri, CAP lead for the city of Steamboat Springs. Other partners assisting with the CAP include Steamboat Springs Chamber and Steamboat Ski & Resort Corp.
A significant portion of the greenhouse gas emission reductions modeled through 2050 in the CAP come from the energy sector, with key contributions via the clean energy transition goals of Xcel Energy, which sells power to Yampa Valley Electric Association. Statewide goals for a majority switch to electric vehicles by 2050 also play a strong role. But strides would need to be made in a variety of other action areas, which are rated in the CAP by priority and complexity.
In the energy sector, some high priority actions include adopting a strategic action plan to improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings and industrial processes in the community; reducing barriers to deployment of renewable energy through review and modification of codes and policies; and developing or supporting renewable energy projects that benefit the whole community, such as community solar arrays.
In the accountability sector, some high priorities include identifying and developing funding sources for climate action work; developing a collaborative program to share resources and jointly fund projects; and updating the greenhouse gas inventory every five years.
For the land use sector, high priorities include protecting and enhancing wetlands and riparian corridors; creating a public-private partnership to expand forest treatments and reintroducing healthy fire into the landscape; protecting natural resources that promote carbon mitigation; and enhancing policies, guidelines and incentives for Smart Growth and compact development.
In the economics sector, high priority examples include expanding green and energy-certified building stock and transitioning to clean power for government, commercial and residential sectors.
""The CAP provides a menu of strategies, actions and tactics that each entity, as well as other stakeholders and partners, can select from for their climate action work,"" Cowman said.
The 10-minute community survey can be found at RouttClimateAction.com/get-involved.
Completion of the CAP was funded by $20,000 each from Routt County and the city of Steamboat, as well as a $25,000 technical assistance grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

While Larimer County continues to recover from the record-breaking Cameron Peak Fire , the community got an update from those leading the recovery.
County and state officials held a virtual community meeting Wednesday evening to discuss the plan going forward and hear community concerns.
""We want to better understand how we can do an even better job at responding to your concerns,"" said Lori Hodges, director of emergency management for the county.
During the meeting, Greg Hanson, a warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder said, as Hodges and others have said in the past, that one of the major concerns going forward is flooding in the areas the fire hit.
""With the loss of vegetation and the intensity of the fire , the soil actually cooks and becomes hydrophobic (meaning the soil will not absorb water),"" Hanson said. ""It takes, compared to what we had before the fire , a lot less rainfall to produce flooding in these areas.""
Hanson said the weather service will issue flood warnings in the spring if the area is forecast to get one-third to one-half an inch of rain in 30 minutes or three-quarters of an inch in an hour.
""A little bit of rain is a good thing, it will get these plants growing again,"" Hanson said. ""A lot of rain will not be a good thing.""
Hanson said it will be important to watch for weather alerts, be it over weather radio or pushed to cellphones, during the spring, as the National Weather Service will launch flood warnings if needed.
Hodges said the U.S. Forest Service has finished its Burn Area Emergency Response Assessment, and Larimer County is expected to have a draft of its risk assessment done by March.
She reiterated that the county is working to get Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for individual assistance, as well as putting together a Small Business Administration declaration, since the county was denied for individual assistance funding.
""We have to figure out what pieces of the pie we are qualified for,"" Hodges said.
One community member asked what the time frame will be for what the county wants to get done. Hodges said what is done when will depend on the risk assessment.
She added that while the county works to recover not everything that needs to be done or the county wants to do can be completed in the first year.
""Flooding is going to remain a risk to some of these areas,"" Hodges said. ""The more communities can do in support of the larger ... area, the better this will be.""
Along with Hodges and Hanson, Derek Gaarder, program manager with Summitstone Health Partners, spoke about emotional support his agency provides and Claire Bouchard with Larimer County United Way discussed some of the community work it is doing, including funding for the unmet needs of the community it is using to help those affected bounce back from the fire.
Alan Kee, plans examiner with the Larimer County Building Department, also said his department will be prioritizing primary residences as owners rebuild their homes. He asked those who are submitting requests to rebuild to note if they are rebuilding primary residences so the process can be sped up.
Larimer County commissioners also spoke Wednesday night and offered their support as community members try to navigate the recovery process. They also confirmed they will be working to get the funding needed for the proposed recovery plans.
""We want to do what we can to help,"" said Kristin Stephens, commissioner from District II. ""Clearly if we need more federal dollars ... we will advocate for that.""
The entire meeting is expected to be uploaded to the county's YouT ube page later.

May 13, 2020  Coloradopolitics.com (CO)  Staff Writer
As Denver and the state begin to reopen this month, people will emerge from their houses having gotten a taste of some potential new normals:
Wearing masks. Working from home. Fewer traffic jams. A Denver skyline free of haze.
Under a stay-at-home order for about a month and a half, the city's sudden shift to stiller life led to some unexpected consequences: cleaner air from falling car emissions, streets turned over to walkers and cyclists, more time to consider the connection between public health and the environment.
""While COVID-19 has helped our air quality, it should serve as a starting point in which we should imagine our world after this,"" said Hannah Collazo, the state director of Environment Colorado, a research and policy nonprofit.
For starters, she said, life post-pandemic could include driving less, using public transit more, keeping some roads closed to cars, and regularly working remotely to reduce daily commutes.
Most importantly, she and other environmental experts say, it could include stronger air pollution protection at the federal and state levels and a harder push toward renewable energy.
""We want to be really clear that we are not taking any joy in COVID-19 leading to healthier air,"" she stressed. ""We just think it's a really opportune time for gathering data that we can use -- once we are no longer sheltering in place -- when we're crafting legislation or trying to educate the public.""
Increasing levels of particulate matter, a primary ingredient in Denver's ""brown cloud,"" is correlated with ""more mortality and more health problems ... and these include increases in deaths and health problems related to cardiovascular disease and respiratory diseases,"" said Lisa McKenzie, a researcher at the University of Colorado Denver who studies the correlation between air pollutants and public health.
Particulate matter is a pollutant that not only causes health problems ""at high levels,"" according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, but also can affect air visibility.
A team of researchers at the Harvard University T .H. Chan School of Public Health recently found a preliminary link between higher rates of COVID-19 deaths and diseases associated with longterm exposure to fine particulate matter, also known as PM 2.5. The tiny particles in the air result from complex reactions of chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are emitted from power plants, refineries and vehicles, according to the Environmental Protection Ag ency.
Harvard's nationwide analysis examined data from 3,080 counties, representing 98% of the population, and found that a ""small increase"" in exposure to PM 2.5 over time leads to a ""large
increase"" in the COVID-19 death rate. The study looked at county data for the past 17 years and coronavirus-related deaths through April 22 from the Coronavirus Resource Center at the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
""Our results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis,"" the researchers wrote.
However, the study's tentative findings, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, have caused an ""uproar"" in the nation's capital, The Washington Post reports, as both the left and right attempt to use the research to advance political agendas.
Clearer skies
The coronavirus is shedding light on other issues related to air quality, too.
Denver's transportation department reports that shortly after the city went into lockdown on March 24, roadways experienced a reduction of traffic by as much as two-thirds. For about two weeks in April, traffic volume held steady around 50%.
With extra street space, several roads around the city were transformed into ""open streets,"" which were closed to cars, as well as ""shared streets,"" which were opened to motorists but designed for residents walking and biking.
According to the Denver Streets Partnership, a sustainable transportation advocacy group, between April 8 and April 19 an average of 1,026 people sauntered down 16th Avenue in North Capitol Hill and City Park West, which was temporarily closed to drivers except those who lived along that stretch.
The results showed that, compared with the same time period in 2015, the number of walkers and bikers hitting the pavement had more than doubled on the days when temperatures were above 40 degrees.
The group and other sustainable transportation advocates say the data, which was collected by a bike and pedestrian counter, makes a strong argument for these kinds of resources to be expanded beyond stay-at-home orders.
But T im Jackson, the president of the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association, disagrees.
""As transit ridership plummets and (the Regional Transportation District) makes drastic cuts, the need for access to personal vehicles is clearer than ever,"" he told Colorado Politics in an email. ""Exploiting this pandemic to push to keep streets closed after the crisis would deliberately increase traffic congestion, create more pollution and hinder the community's ability to rebound economically.""
The city's transportation department has no new plans to expand open and shared streets, especially as Denver's government prepares to make steep budget cuts due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
However, Denver opened a permanent ""shared street"" on 35th Avenue, barred cars from a oneblock stretch of Bannock Street and plans to rebuild a recreation area with a bicycle path on 39th Avenue later this year. In December, Mayor Michael Hancock announced the city was also speeding up efforts to install 125 miles of bike lanes by 2023.
While stay-at-home orders kept most people off the roadways, the speed of traffic flow during Denver's morning rush hour traffic also increased by an average of 13%, according to an April 28 report from INRIX, a transportation analytics company.
Vehicles moved even more freely during the 5 p.m. rush-hour, with an increase in travel speeds by about a quarter.
""These gains in travel speeds help employees and caretakers continue their essential work without delay and allow local fleets of commercial companies the ability to speed up delivery and achieve a higher number of deliveries,"" the INRIX report stated.
A May 1 analysis of Denver's air quality amid the stay-at-home order found ""significant drops"" in all air pollutants evaluated. The study, conducted by CDPHE, evaluated PM 2.5 and nitrogen dioxide at the air quality monitor at 2105 Broadway in Denver during mid-March through mid-April between 2010 and 2020.
PM 2.5 levels dropped by 10.4%, according to the analysis. Levels of nitrogen dioxide -- a pollutant formed from emissions of motor vehicles, power plants and off-road equipment -- decreased by 28%.
The CDPHE report explained that Denver likely saw smaller decreases in PM 2.5 because of the variability of natural sources that contribute to the pollutant. In dry, windy years, for example, there is likely to be more dust kicked up in the air. During colder years, more smoke blows about from wood- burning .
The state health department estimates that natural sources, like smoke and dust, contribute roughly 10% to particulate matter, but that percentage ""can be much higher"" -- it all depends on the weather.
Still, Robert Spotts, the transportation planning supervisor for the Denver Regional Council of Governments, said impacts shown from the analysis are ""intuitively much less than you might think.
""It points to how much human activity is still kind of happening, even though we're cooped up in our houses. There is still power being generated, there are still delivery trucks traveling all over,"" he said. ""It's not a ghost town out there.""
Ongoing construction in Denver, which went largely unhalted under public health orders -- and for some projects, including those on Interstates 70 and 25, even ramped up due to less people on the roads -- also ""definitely"" has ""an influence"" on air quality, Scott Landes, supervisor of CDPHE's meteorology and prescribed fire unit, said during a virtual Electric Vehicle Coalition meeting in April.
""While there has definitely been some significant air quality improvements, depending on where you live, you might not actually be experiencing the same kind of pollution reduction,"" said Sophia Mayott-Guerrero, an energy and transportation advocate at Conservation Colorado, an environmental advocacy group.
""Everyone's experiencing that benefit differently,"" including people who live along Denver's ""inverted L,"" she said, which is a stretch of precincts that runs northeast along the I-70 corridor and south along Federal Boulevard. Those precincts also include where many of Denver's lowestincome residents live.
""The currenthealth crisis has really pointed out and demonstrated the health outcomes associated with air pollution and some of those disparities,"" Mayott-Guerrero said, ""and it's really critical, as we see several federal rules get rolled back on some air pollution protections, that the state steps up and takes leadership, recognizing that it is something contributing to public health.""
In many cities across the country and around the world, data has shown that traffic and pollution improved while stay-at-home orders kept most cars in park.
For example, The New York T imes reported that major U.S. cities, such as Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle, saw air pollution ""plummet"" between March 2019 and 2020.
However, the data -- which the Descartes Lab compiled from satellites that detect traffic-related emissions in the atmosphere -- has been questioned by some scientists.
Europe's atmosphere monitoring service, for example, said the mapping was ""flawed"" because differences in weather conditions, specifically cloud cover, between the two years weren't taken into account.
Still, there is no doubt that people were driving less under public health orders.
Nationwide, personal vehicle miles traveled dropped by 46% between March 14 and April 17, according to the INRIX report.
Denver's brown cloud
Denver became known for its problematic air more than a century ago. In 1889, The Denver T imes reported that ""disease had started to spread to the entire population"" and ""bad air was hurting the city's reputation.""
By the mid-1950s, health officials ""really became concerned about air quality,"" said Lisa Devore, an environmental engineer at CDPHE. Denver logged 1,250 air pollution complaints in 1956 from residents concerned about excessive smoke and other problems in the air.
Public pressure led to action at both the state and federal level. The Colorado legislature adopted the Air Pollution Control Act in 1970. That same year, Congress amended the Clean Air Act, which authorized the EPA to establish new national standards on air pollution from vehicles and factories.
Not long after this time, Denver's looming air pollution came to be known as the ""brown cloud.""
The brown cloud peaked in the 1970s and '80s before cleaner fuel and sustainable emissions technology had been fully utilized. Although pollution in the air has improved, environmental experts say it still poses a threat as more people, and their cars, continue to make Denver home.
""It's worse in the winter because of something called temperature inversion,"" Devore explained, when cold air gets trapped under a layer of warmer air.
""In Denver, because we're actually in somewhat of a bowl, where we're bounded on one side by the mountains and the Platte River Valley on the other side, which actually rises up a little bit, so we become trapped.""
Those inversions can last between a day, sometimes even a couple of weeks, she said, and when those happen, the air is stagnant.
""You don't have much wind, and the air is circulating within our bowl ... and people continue to operate as usual, so they drive their cars, companies operate as they always would, and all of that pushes stuff inside the bowl until we see a change in weather conditions,"" Devore said.
The term describes the dark haze that hovers over Denver as a result of a mix of various fine particulates and gases. Two types of particles can create haze: primary particles -- think organic and soot particles in smoke plumes or soil dust -- and secondary particles, such as sulfates and nitrates.
Haze was historically worse in the wintertime due to wood-burning and road sanding during construction, as well as in summer, because of road sanding and forest fires .
Usually the haze is local, particularly in winter, although for other seasons it can depend on meteorology and regional weather patterns.
In 1987, CDPHE began implementing a high pollution advisory ""action day"" program for the Denver metro area during the winter months between Oct. 31 and March 31.
""The primary goal of the advisory program is to provide useful information on air quality to area residents during the high pollution season,"" according to the department.
""Action days"" were issued when air quality conditions could lead to air pollution levels above federal and/or state standards. Those days trigger mandatory burning restrictions and voluntary driving reductions. CDPHE also implemented in 1990 visibility metrics directly correlated with the brown cloud.
Data shows that frequency of exceedances over the urban visibility standard are decreasing. From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, exceedances decreased from 70% to about 50%.
In recent years, data from the transmissometer, which had begun being used in the 1990s to
monitor visibility metrics, is no longer being tracked ""due to technical issues,"" according to CDPHE, but the Continuous Air Monitoring Program has since been adopted as a substitute.
Since the late 1990s, there has been an approximate 33% decrease in particulate matter in Denver's air, the department reports.
The improvements reflect control strategies that state and local health departments have established to clean up Denver's air, including reducing street sanding by half, implementing restrictions and standards on wood-burning, installing low-nitrogen oxide burners at power plants, expanding the bus system and more.
Where we stand
Denver's brown cloud issue hasn't gone away, experts say, but rather evolved into a thick smog that's seen when ozone levels spike.
In December, the EPA announced it was changing the Denver area's classification from ""Moderate"" to ""Serious"" under the Clean Air Act for failing to meet federal 2008 ozone standards in a ""timely"" manner.
""EPA is taking this action based on monitoring data showing that ozone remains a challenge in Denver and northern Front Range communities,"" EPA Regional Administrator Gregory Sopkin stated in the December news release. ""We thank our partners at the State of Colorado in working with EPA to strengthen air quality plans and implement these measures to further reduce ozoneforming emissions from sources across the region.""
In 2018, the Denver metro area logged 131 days of degraded air quality, meaning half or more of its monitoring stations reported elevated levels of PM 2.5 and/or elevated ozone.
""We know as ozone levels increase, so does the risk for worsening of asthma and our respiratory diseases,"" said Lisa McKenzie, the researcher from the University of Colorado Denver.
The latest report from the American Lung Association ranked Denver as the 10th-most ozonepolluted city in the country. Los Angeles landed at No. 1.
""Coronavirus is a respiratory disease that is wreaking havoc on the lungs of those infected,"" U.S. Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Denver said in an email. ""Second to eliminating the virus altogether, one of the most important things we can do right now to improve the public health is improve air quality.""
DeGette is preparing to introduce new legislation that would create a federal clean energy standard to help cut carbon emissions from the power sector by 2050. Meanwhile, the T rump administration is working to roll back Obama-era air pollution regulations on toxins provided by oil and coal power plants.
""The science is clear. If we are going to avoid the worst effects of our climate crisis, the U.S. has to take drastic steps now to cut our carbon emissions. The problem is that all of the technology we
need to do that does not yet exist,"" DeGette said. ""By creating a national clean-energy standard that all U.S. power companies will have to adhere to, we will be able to spur the innovation and deployment of the new technologies we'll need to solve this crisis.""
Democratic state Rep. Dominique Jackson of Aurora introduced a bill in January that would significantly increase fines for air and water quality violations, which currently max out at $15,000 per day. If passed, daily fines per violation would be as high as $47,357.
While still an issue, ozone from vehicles has primarily decreased due to new technology and cleaner fuel standards, transportation experts say.
""Even though more people are driving in our region, emissions from vehicles keep going down,"" said Robert Spotts, the transportation planning supervisor for the Denver Regional Council of Governments. ""We estimate that, even though we've had a lot of population growth over the last 10 years, our emissions have reduced by about 50% of what they were in 2010.
""And we anticipate them to continue to decrease all the way up to 2040, which is our current planning horizon here.""
Hancock plans to transition Denver to 100% renewable energy by 2030. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis aims to get the entire state there by 2040.
Air pollution experts agree that we have a ways to go on both the federal and local level.
""I don't think it's a problem that's ever going to be fully solved as long as we're an industrial society,"" CDPHE's Devore said, ""but we continue to make improvements.""

April 13, 2021  Delta County Independent (CO)  Special to Delta County Independent
Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) is partnering with the Colorado Youth Corps Association (CYCA) to hire 33 weeks of conservation service corps to repair trails impacted by wildfire damage and increased visitation in areas that are open to motorized recreation.
As Coloradans and visitors sought solace from the pandemic, Colorado's trails saw explosive growth in visitation in 2020 as people looked for outdoor and socially-distanced activities. Local, state and federal outdoor agencies across the state reported on average a 30% increase in visitation on public lands. In addition to higher visitation, last summer's catastrophic wildfires also posed new challenges for Colorado's trail network, as heavily burned wildfire areas shifted wildlife movements and the connectivity of some trails due to postburn hot spots in forest areas.
""As we monitor how human use and natural disasters impact our outdoor spaces, we have an obligation to work together to protect our trails so that they can be enjoyed for generations to come,"" said CPW's State Trails Program Manager Fletcher Jacobs. ""CPW is very grateful and fortunate to partner with so many wonderful organizations that share our passion to connect people to Colorado's outdoors through educational experiences. We look forward to collaborating with CYCA because it allows us to bond with our outdoor community at a grassroots level, and get our hands dirty together as we work toward rebuilding areas that will enhance recreation opportunities.""
CPW shares the same goal with CYCA -- to inspire young people to connect with the outdoors while helping them understand how to balance outdoor recreation with mindful conservation. This partnership demonstrates the commitment of both entities to work together toward a mutually beneficial stewardship education strategy.
While Colorado's OHV recreators already play a critical role in sustaining motorized trails for the state by annually funding over $4 million in trail opportunities and improvements, this newly-funded project is an innovative way to involve conservation corps to help contribute to trail maintenance in Colorado.
""Spending time in nature helps teach us, inspires us and nourishes our bodies and minds,"" said CYCA's Executive Director Scott Segerstrom. ""Working together with CPW on these trail projects is a wonderful way to empower our youth and young adults and demonstrate that they can make a significant difference to help conserve our public lands. T hrough experiential learning, our corps members are gaining knowledge on how they can transform landscapes and give back to their community .""
CPW staff and CYCA-accredited conservation service corps will be working on the following motorized trail maintenance projects this summer:
Grand Lake / Still Water Fire RehabDue to the devastation of our motorized trail systems by the historical wildfires on the Sulphur Ranger District in 2020 and the critical resource protection
considerations associated with runoff and benched trail tread in burn scars, this project is of the utmost importance to our forest , state and region. There is a need for exceptional OHV riding areas and opportunities like those provided by the Grand Lake Trail System prior to both providing motorized recreation and protection of the sensitive areas buffered by a quality trail system with a consistent presence. Work will include an estimated quantity of OHV routes affected by wildfire in the two areas is 200+ miles.
Alpine Loop Backcountry BywayThe Alpine Loop Backcountry Byway is a destination location for 385,000 visitors annually. The proliferation of vehicle-accessible dispersed campsites, along the Alpine Loop, are becoming a capacity and density issue, affecting visitor experience and impacting natural resources. The BLM is working toward addressing these issues through campsite designation. The work would include obliterating 125 rock fire rings, bagging ash piles containing nails and glass, cleaning up trash, installing 125 metal fire rings and campsite posts and bucking and felling hazard trees. Designating campsites will address issues the proliferation of campsites, trash, soil compaction in fragile locations and vehicle encroachment off of the roadways.
Rainbow Trail MaintenanceThe Rainbow Trail is a 100-mile-long motorized trail that is all singletrack width and open to dirt bikes, horses, hikers, and mountain bikes but due to limited access points, is most popular amongst dirt bikers. With the use of saw crews, hazard tree mitigation will substantially help with user safety as well as trail sustainability.
The increase in visitation proves the importance of outdoor spaces to Coloradans, and a collective need to invest in restoring and expanding a trail network system so increased human use does not overwhelm our state's natural resources. This trail funding provided by OHV users and the physical work by dedicated conservation service corps will provide additional access and recreational opportunities that connect people to the outdoors.

Crews make significant progress on Sylvan Fire despite.txt,"Crews make significant progress on Sylvan Fire despite
containment remaining at zero
June 27, 2021  Sky-Hi News (Granby, CO)
Author: Nate Peterson Vail Daily News Section: News 1730 Words
OpenURL Link
9:30 p.m. update: The rain that has fallen on the Sylvan Fire in recent days has been a blessing. That
said, it has also slowed down firefighting efforts in some of the most treacherous terrain of the burn.
With the help of nearly an inch of rain, on average, across the fire since Thursday, the blaze south of
Eagle in the White River National Forest has hung tight at 3,775 acres  nearly 6 square miles.
But with the rain comes slippery footing, which slowed firefighting efforts Friday and Saturday in the more
troublesome terrain of the blaze, located south and east of LEDE Reservoir.
As of Saturday night, containment on the fire remains at zero, but those numbers should come up in the
coming days, said Michelle Kelly, a public information officer working with the Rocky Mountain Type 1
Incident Management Team assigned to the fire.
""The rain brought slowing of fire behavior and fire growth, but it also provides some slippery conditions
that actually slow down some of the firefighting,"" Kelly said. ""We do expect some of those containment
numbers to come up.""
Kelly said late Saturday night that there are now 318 personnel on the fire, up from 264 at the start of the
day. The fire has been classified the top priority incident in the Rocky Mountain Region as incident
commanders hope additional resources will be deployed to the blaze in the days ahead.
During a Friday evening Facebook community meeting, Rob Powell, the operations section chief for the
fire, noted that the resources at risk  an Xcel Energy transmission line and the Eagle and Gypsum
watersheds  earned the priority designation. And with that title, he said additional resources should be
headed to the fight. But with a fiery summer already started, Western resources are starting to thin.
Rain to the rescue
The fire, on average, received 0.2 inches of rain Friday night and into Saturday morning and saw another
0.2 inches Saturday afternoon and evening. All told, 0.89 inches of rain have fallen on the fire since
Thursday, but the rain has not fallen equally across the fire.
A hot shot crew working the fire Saturday was able to engage directly with the fire in some areas, Kelly
said.
""They're making some really good progress in some really steep terrain,"" she said.
Two branches
The Sylvan Fire has split into two main branches. Crews are attacking one branch along the Eagle
Thomasville Road, which will be the primary fire line.
""We're working really hard on that 400 road and getting that dug in, so that the fire doesn't push harder
and higher when it dries out,"" Kelly said.
Kelly called the fire a ""mosaic fire"" with patches of green and black throughout the forest  and those
green spots could become troublesome in the coming days when it is expected to dry out.
She said fire officials are always cautious about putting containment line on a map, wanting to be
absolutely certain that an ember can't cross a fire line when temperatures dry out or wind kicks up 
which is what happened when the fire had its big blowup earlier in the week.
""We really want to make sure that we're cold trailing, and that there's not something like that could cross
the road,"" she said.
While the fire burned down to Sylvan Lake this week, Powell noted that crews launched a direct attack in
that area. He said crews worked the fire's edge using natural features to corral the spread.
""Things are looking really good there. We are making progress,"" Powell said.
The other branch of the fire is burning in more troublesome terrain. Accessibility is difficult in the area,
located south and east of LEDE Reservoir near Gypsum. Crews have made significant progress lining
the portion of the fire that moved south of the Mount Thomas Trail and ridgeline. The objective of
completing this section of line to prevent further southward fire movement should be met in the next few
days, according to a Saturday morning update. Firefighters will then prepare an indirect fireline extending
westward along Mount Thomas Trail.
Portions of this part of the fire are steep, inaccessible and unsafe to put firefighters into. If an accident or
injury were to happen to a firefighter in this terrain, it would be extremely difficult to get them out for
treatment, fire managers said.
Supervisors will monitor the fire's activity in the area and take action only if necessary to stop the fire at
the indirect line. Natural features, such as scree slopes and aspen stands, will instead be used where
possible to restrict the fire's advancement.
In the northwestern part of the fire, firefighters continue to build direct fireline using UTV's to access the
area over existing primitive roads and trails.
Sylvan Fire at a glance
Location: Eagle County, White River National Forest in Sylvan Lake State Park, 16 miles south of Eagle
Size: 3,775 acres
Fuel: Spruce-fir
Cause: Suspected lightning, still under investigation
Date of Ignition: June 20 around 3:15 PM
Firefighting Personnel: 264 and counting
Containment: 0%
Closures lifted
As fire crews dig into the blaze, evacuations and closures have been lifted in some areas near the
Sylvan Fire.
As another wave of rainstorms soaked the valley Friday afternoon, Eagle County Sheriff James van
Beek announced he modified some of the evacuation orders associated with the Sylvan Fire.
The evacuation orders for the areas of Fulford, Yeoman and Hat Creek have now been downgraded to a
pre-evacuation status. Residents in this area should still be prepared to leave the area immediately with
little to no notice should evacuation orders be reinstated.
The pre-evacuation orders for Salt Creek, Bruce Creek and Frost Creek have been lifted.
The Hardscrabble area will remain under a mandatory evacuation order and is closed at this time. The
Gypsum Creek area remains under a pre-evacuation order.
The Burnt Mountain Road and Woods Lake areas have been downgraded to a pre-evacuation status.
Residents in these areas should still be prepared to leave immediately with little to no notice should
evacuation orders be reinstated.
But while campers can return to the woods, Leanne Veldhuis of the Eagle/Holy Cross Ranger District of
the White River National Forest reminded recreationalists that Stage 2 fire regulations have been enacted
across the forest.
That means no campfires, even in established campgrounds,"" she said.
On Friday, van Beek enacted Stage 2 fire restrictions countywide.
Community welcome
Powell said most of the fire crews are camping out at Sylvan Lake State Park. ""They are happy up there.
It is great camping,"" he said. Future plans include establishing a second base camp at LEDE Reservoir.
""There has been nothing but great hospitality around town,"" added Paul Duarte of the Rocky Mountain
Type I Incident Team. He thanked community members for their support for fire crews.
""We will be here for a little while,"" Duarte said.
During Friday's Facebook community meeting, Van Beek noted there as been some online chatter from
drone pilots about scoping out the burn area.
""Do not, do not, do not fly your drones up in the area,"" Van Beek said. ""You are violating the law and
putting lives at risk.""
Temporary flight restrictions are in place over the Sylvan Fire. Wildfires are a no drone zone. If you fly,
firefighting resources can't. Whenever a drone is spotted near the fire, all aircraft are grounded until the
drone is clear of the area. For more information, visit KnowBeforeYouFly.org.

There is a new Facebook page, Sylvan Fire Information, where updates will be provided.
As with all Eagle County emergencies, the community is coming together to support the first responders
fighting the Sylvan Fire.
The Eagle Valley Community Foundation is currently rallying resources, including food, for the firefighters
as they continue to arrive in Eagle County. As part of its Community Market program, the foundation is
supplying snacks and meals for the fighters with the help of local restaurants and the local MIRA bus.
For Friday morning, Grand Avenue Grill is preparing 400 servings of eggs, bacon, fruit and waffles for the
firefighters.
The foundation is also putting together a relief fund for the firefighters to help them get the resources they
need. Donations can be made at eaglevalleycf.org.
The local Red Cross and Salvation Army are also helping to provide support right now.
Dan Smith, with the Vail Valley Salvation Army, has been on the scene since Sunday in his 4-wheel
drive canteen set-up, providing meals on site for the firefighters.
""It's an art form,"" Smith said. ""They've had a terrible day and we like to be a highlight.""
Friday, Smith and his canteen will be clearing out to allow for other community organizations to provide
meals. However, you can continue to support the Vail Valley Salvation Army as they provide require
volunteers and resources for future efforts with the fire. Smith also noted that the local Salvation Army is
always looking for large commercial kitchens to provide meals during emergencies.
For more information on how to support or volunteer to help the local Salvation Army, call 970-748-0704.
A pre-evacuation order has been issued for Gypsum Creek Road past mile marker 6, Frost Creek, Salt
Creek and Bruce Creek.
People in these areas may be asked to evacuate if the fire worsens.
Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for the areas of Hat Creek, Yeoman State Park, and
Fulford.
Those who have immediate needs for relocating livestock should call 970-379-7731. Now is the time to
prepare to leave and consider precautionary movement of those with special needs, mobile property and
large animals.
Eagle Valley High School in Gypsum may be used as an evacuation center. Both Eagle Valley Middle
and Eagle Valley Elementary have been offered up as staging and camp areas for the Forest Service
and firefighters.
Hardscrabble Road is completely closed, and the town of Eagle has posted information about fire-related

Firefighters contained a grass fire that grew to 9 acres Sunday afternoon near the Rampart Range campus of Pikes Peak Community College, according to the Colorado Springs Fire Department.
The fire, northeast of InterQuest and Voyager parkways on the city's far north side, was started by a malfunctioning hobby drone that crashed, the Fire Department tweeted about 6 p.m.
No buildings were damaged and 33 firefighters remained to watch for hot spots, the Fire Department tweeted about 4 p.m. Firefighters were aided by El Paso County Wildland Fire and the Black Forest Fire Department.

Fire crews worked a small wildland fire Friday in the Roaring Fork Valley near the Lazy Glen community and should have it completely out by Saturday evening, a fire official said Friday night.
The fire is on Bureau of Land Management property and is not easily accessible. A U.S. Forest Service ground crew is on scene but is waiting for weather to pass before they go back up Friday night, Jim Genung, fire management officer with the Upper Colorado River Interagency Fire Management Unit, said about 6 p.m.
He said a lightning strike Thursday night in the area is the cause of the fire, but they could not find it when they went up in the evening. He said the fire ""kicked up with the winds"" that came through Friday afternoon. It has burned about a half-acre but was ""taking on a good rain right now,"" Genung said.
When the weather clears the ground crew will return to the burn area, and another team will join Saturday and there should be 10-12 federal firefighters on the scene, he said.
""Weather permitting, we should have it buttoned by (Saturday) evening,"" Genung said.
Roaring Fork Fire Rescue Chief Scott T hompson said earlier Friday the fire is to the north of the Lazy Glen community (near mile marker 26 on Highway 82), a few hundred yards up the hill and burning in pinon and juniper trees. He said no structures are threatened and there are no evacuations.
""We've used two small air tankers and they've boxed it in, but the fire is going to be visible tonight and most of tomorrow depending on how much moisture we get,"" T hompson said from the scene. ""If you're driving up Holland Hills and Lazy Glen, it's in your face.""
Genung said the two single-engine air tankers were able to each make two drops and form a box around the fire.
The lightning that moved through with Thursday night's storms caused four or five fires in the region, Genung said. He said crews worked Friday morning on a small fire west of the Grizzly Creek burn scar, and then other small fires in western Garfield County and on BLM land.
This is a developing story that will be updated.

The Cameron Peak fire approached Colorado State University's mountain campus west of Fort Collins on Saturday, but prevention efforts have thus far spared any damage.
A host of sprinklers, hoses and pumps throughout the campus have been successful in keeping the fire from burning any structures, said Cass Cairns, spokeswoman for the Cameron Peak fire efforts.
On Friday, CSU President Joyce McConnell told the college community that the fire was expected to move through the mountain campus that day.
But as the fire approached, officials wetted the area through the network of hoses, sprinklers and pumps, as well as dropped retardant and conducted burns to protect structures, Cairns said.
""It is a success story at this point,"" she said.
Yet fire officials are still worried about the satellite campus, as well as other nearby areas such as the Lutheran Sky Ranch Camp and Pingree Park, Cairns said.
Winds are expected to remain relatively light Saturday -- a positive for firefighters -- but temperatures remain above average and the relative humidity is so low that fuels are not retaining much moisture overnight, leaving them ripe for burning.
The Cameron Peak fire, the third largest in state history, has continued to expand in recent days, fueled by low relative humidity and record-high temperatures. As of Saturday morning, it had burned 133,844 acres, 209 square miles, with 44% containment through the Roosevelt National Forest .

Colorado areas scorched by fires are becoming less suitable for sustaining two important species, the ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, two of the most recognizable trees in the state's forests, according to a new University of Colorado Boulder study.
Lead author Kyle Rodman, who conducted the study while he was a doctorate student in the department of geography, explained, ""Two immediate sets of issues that come to mind are social and scientific. The social problem is that what we come to think of when we think of Colorado recreation is changing. With additional warming, many current forests are likely to convert to shrub or grass cover, particularly in places that burn severely and are in dry areas. Scientifically speaking, forests are crucial habitat for many plant and animal species. A loss of forest cover also means more carbon in the atmosphere, which has the potential to further increase fire activity and inhibit forest recovery.""
The area used in the study involved 22 burn sites encompassing more than 700 square miles of forest spreading through southern Wyoming across central and western Colorado down to northern New Mexico.
The research took a few different scenarios into account. The variables were heavily based on how much action is taken to combat climate change. The moderate models considered declining emissions by the year 2040 while others considered no combating of the crisis.
Currently, about half the research area is capable of some post-fire recovery. Under the moderate scenario by 2051, only about 18% of both Douglas fir and ponderosa pine will be recoverable if burned. If nothing is done to stop the emission of greenhouse gases, then as little as 3.5% of the trees will be salvageable, the study said.
Researchers also noted the number of acres burned has almost doubled across the country since the 1990s. The wildfire problem across the region is proving to be its personal climate feedback problem.
Earlier studies conducted were not as large but yielded other results. The burn sites from the 2000 Walker Ranch Fire have hardly or not at all recovered. Fifteen years after the fires and almost 80% of the destroyed areas had no new trees, according to those studies.
Scientists were able to reconstruct what the forest looked like before the blazes and found that forest areas that were ravaged by wildfires in the 19th and 20th centuries had much easier times bouncing back, but now they are struggling to recover in the dryer and warmer conditions.
Higher elevations, lower temperatures seemed to fare better unsurprising to the researchers.
The inverse proved true as well. Lower-elevation forests, such as south of Pueblo or areas such as the Front Range foothills are not as resilient.
""The big takeaway here is that we can expect to have an increase in fire continue for the foreseeable future, and, at the same time, we are going to see much of our land convert from forest to non-forest . Even the moderate model is alarming."" said Veblen, co-author, and professor of geography at CU Boulder.

Dan Gibbs wildland firefighterstate executive.txt,"Dan Gibbs, wildland firefighter/state executive
November 14, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Springs, CO)

In October, Dan Gibbs, whose day job is executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural
Resources, got up close and personal with the Cameron Peak fire as it raged through more than 200,000
acres of the Arapaho-Roosevelt national forests near Glen Haven.
There were times when he stood a foot away from the flames.
Buthe wasn't there to monitor what the fires would do to watersheds. Gibbs was there as a Type 2
certified wildland firefighter, a volunteer job he's held since 2007. He's been on the front lines of the
recent fires, at Cameron Peak and in August at the Grizzly Creek fire near Glenwood Springs.
What does a firefighter think of so close to the flames that can turn in a second ? How to get out.
It's part of the training, Gibbs explained. It's physical labor, all day long, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. many
days. He likened it to doing Crossfit for 16 hours straight.
One of the main jobs is to clear fuels  that's anything flammable, such as brush and trees  away
from the homes they were trying to save.
If the fire was approaching a house, they would go right up to the fire line and dig trenches and clear
vegetation. Homes with a defensible space have a fighting chance, Gibbs said.
Many of the homes are heated with propane tanks, and they would spray the tanks with foam to prevent
them from exploding. They didn't win them all. Once, when they were spray-foaming a tank, they heard a
large boom. It was the tank at the house next to them.
Cameron Peak was unique, Gibbs said. The winds would gust up to 50 or 60 mph, which not only would
blow someone over, but create uncertainty that can be life threatening to firefighters.
""We're constantly thinking, how do I get out of here?"" Gibbs said. At one home, fire burned one side of
the property, and, while they saved the house, the fire went from the northside to the south, and that's
where the propane tank was. There was just one way out, on the driveway, with fire on both sides of it.
In those situations, there are a lot of ""snags""  trees coming down  and firefighters worry that a snag
would come down on that road and block their only escape route.
""That's the reality of a lot of fire situations,"" Gibbs said.
State and federal call-ups
Gibbs went through the Colorado Wildland Fire and Incident Academy in 2007. Minimum qualifications
include a ""red card,"" a federal credential that allows a firefighter to go on federal lands. Everything has a
credential, even the equipment, he said.
The fires he's fought in 2020 have largely been on federal lands. Gibbs is on the state and federal call-up
system. When they call, he goes. He's not part of a regular crew, but gets plugged in with teams when
he shows up at a staging area.
It's not a job that you go home from at the end of the day. Firefighters stay on site, often sleeping on the
ground near areas just extinguished. One night they slept in an area where the fuels had burned away,
Gibbs said. The fire was still all around them but they were in a safe zone. ""At night, the skies looked like
the Fourth of July,"" he said.
On his Facebook page in late October, Gibbs said the week was ""unsettling, exhilarating and emotionally
draining to say the least.  This was perhaps one of my most intense deployments as our team was
directly attacking the fire by digging fire lines, engaging in structure protection and building defensible
space.""
Gibbs added that the ""persistent high winds and intense smoke were some of the worst I have ever
encountered and many of my teammates agreed.
""I can't say enough about my team on the Cameron Peak fire and all the wildland firefighters who are at
this very moment risking their lives to save homes and our communities. Many I served with had no
health insurance or were from seasoned-out Hotshot crews. We must explore ways to give these men
and women the resources they need to be as safe and effective as possible and explore making these
positions permanent because fire season is now no longer seasonal.""
Now that the fires are approaching containment  Cameron Peak is at 92% containment, according to
InciWeb, the federal incident information system  Gibbs has gone back to his day job, which will
involve the aftermath.
Protecting the watershed
Among DNR's first tasks is to protect rivers and other natural resources from the fire impacts.
Fires like Cameron Peak and Grizzly Creek, which ran alongside the Colorado River through Glenwood
Canyon, have huge impacts on water supplies, Gibbs explained. A grant program from DNR's Colorado
Water Conservation Board will deal with watershed restoration and flood mitigation.
That program is designed to help affected communities develop planning and engineering strategies to
mitigate flood and debris flow risks.
Another DNR-managed program: mitigation grants, which help pay to create defensible space around
buildings and infrastructure, including water supplies.
Grant funds supported by DNR also provide forest restoration.
CWCB also has a tool known as FACE, short for ""future avoided cost explorer""  to help educate
counties and local governments on the potential future costs of wildfires, floods and drought as the
climate changes and Colorado's population grows, to encourage long-term, resilient planning.
Another challenge is breaking down ""silos"" that exist between federal, state, tribal agencies and private
landowners in dealing with the aftermath of wildfires and how to deal with them in the future. Gibbs said
fires don't know the difference between those kinds of landscapes. He believes there is better
collaboration on wildfire issues, due in part to a ""shared stewardship"" memorandum of understanding
between the state and the U.S. Forest Service, signed in October 2019.
Climate change and management
The other issue for DNR is climate change. Gibbs pointed out that the 20 largest fires in Colorado have
all happened in the last 20 years. Temperatures are climbing, and on average are higher than during the
1930s Dust Bowl. Then there's drought. The entire state is in drought, and 74% is in the worst drought
conditions.
Gibbs said one of the biggest challenges is that a million Coloradans live in wildland-urban interface
areas. A hundred years ago, you could let the forest in those unpopulated areas burn, but today those
are population centers, he said.
He acknowledged county commissioners are under tremendous pressure to approve new
developments, and he would know, since he spent eight years as a Summit County commissioner.
But when he's out on the fire lines, trying to protect a home that's next to a wilderness boundary, he's
thinking ""who approved this?""
Gibbs said if he had a magic wand, he'd tie community wildfire protection plans  required for
communities with fire risks  to development codes. That would then require county commissioners to
think about the potential wildfire activity that could happen before they approve a development. Many
counties do that, but not all.

In November 2018, Marble Town Manager Ron Leach received a letter thathe said was a wake-up call.
The letter was a notice from the Colorado Division of Water Resources that the town's water rights had
been ""out of priority"" for four weeks the previous August and September because of a call placed by a
senior water-rights holder downstream on the Crystal River.
During drought years  and 2018 was an extreme one, with the Crystal running at less than 5% of
average after peaking in May, several weeks earlier than usual  junior water-rights holders may have
to curtail their water usage until the senior call is satisfied.
""Drought and water supply have been on people's minds for a long time around here, but we've never
gotten a letter like that,"" Leach said.
The letter urged the Marble Water Co.  the private company that delivers water to the town's
approximately 150 residents and a handful of businesses  to create a plan of augmentation, which is
an alternate source of water such as a storage pond. Without augmentation, the letter warned, a call
could subject Marble to a cease-and-desist order on its municipal water wells.
Several other neighborhoods that get their water from the Crystal also narrowly dodged a bullet that
August. The same senior call put more than 40 homes in Carbondale at risk of not having water,
according to Town Manager Jay Harrington.
Noting that Marble's water supply barely exceeds peak summer demand, an engineering firm's
preliminary recommendation was for an 11-acre-foot reservoir, which would require 3 to 4 acres of flat
ground.
""The town of Marble doesn't have cash to do anything like that,"" said Leach, who added that space in the
constrained mountain valley might also be a hurdle. ""There's no easy solution.""
A very dry 2020 has underscored that the water issue is not going away anytime soon. During what's
now widely accepted as a two-decade-long drought in the Colorado River basin, temperatures have
risen, summer rains can't be relied on and streamflows have dropped, with earlier peak flows sometimes
leaving little water in streams by late summer. The state's letter to Marble noted that ""it is reasonable to
assume that this administration scenario could happen more frequently in the future.""
To those who deal with water day to day, there's no question that climate change is here and its impacts
are being increasingly felt in the summer.
""It all starts with climate change  that's the big picture,"" Leach said. ""What's happening in Marble, this
is the micro-example.""
Other Roaring Fork municipalities also are grappling with climate-caused water-supply issues. The city
of Aspen, which provides municipal water from free-flowing Maroon and Castle creeks and has seen
Stage 2 water restrictions enacted two of the past three summers, is creating a 50-year water plan 
driven in part by climate-change impacts  that may include expanded water storage. In Basalt, the

Delta County Commissioners are considering entering fire restrictions at the recommendation of Delta
County Sheriff Mark Taylor and other fire agencies.
Taylor made a brief report to commissioners during the board's regular meeting on June 15. He said last
week fire officials in the region were ready to make a decision. As of Monday the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) made plans to move into fire restrictions Wednesday at midnight.
A second fire meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, June 16. Taylor told the board he anticipates the
consensus of fire officials will be to go into restrictions.
""We all know that it's extremely hot, extremely dry, windy and potential for fires is high right now so, I
anticipate everybody in the region going into some type of restrictions,"" Taylor said. ""We need to be
together for the community as far as being able to be consistent with each county so if you're in and out
of Montrose County and Delta County it's the same restrictions. That's been the basis of these phone
calls so we can all be on the same page.
Taylor said fire restrictions and their timing typically vary among the different Forest Service areas and
BLM.
""It would be much more effective if we could get everybody on the same page, not a matter of just being
across a boundary line and which restriction you need to follow,"" Commissioner Don Suppes said.
Taylor said he plans to meet with the county attorney following Wednesday's meeting to work on a draft
resolution to bring before commissioners. There was discussion on upcoming 4th of July fireworks
throughout the area. County Administrator Robbie LeValley brought up past restrictions on firework
sales. Taylor said he hadn'theard any discussion on the issue this year from Delta County
municipalities.
""As far as I know, they're still moving forward,"" he said, adding that may change depending on the
commissioner's recommendations.
Commissioners stated they will consider holding a special meeting as soon as they need to institute
countywide fire restrictions.

Denver eyes expansion for its water customers  464 million p.txt,"Denver eyes expansion for its water customers - $464 million project
near Boulder will be complicated and doesn't have full support

A few miles north of Coal Creek Canyon, through the pines and gambel oak, and past yards, fences and
hillsides dotted with ""No Trespassing"" signs, the Gross Dam horseshoes against two mountainsides to
collect Colorado's most precious resource: water.
The Denver metro couldn't go a day without it, Denver Water Engineering Manager Doug Raitt said as he
looked across the frozen Gross Reservoir. Other amenities, sure, but not water.
Demand for water in Denver is expected to increase by a third within the next decade, according to the
utility's 2014 study. That could lead to an annual shortfall of more than 34,000 acre-feet of water, enough
to last 225,000 people an entire year.
Wildfires, drought and climate change constantly endanger the state's snowpack, which feeds into the
utility's reservoirs and supply streams and rivers. Long-standing conservation efforts -- perhaps you've
seen the billboards -- can no longer keep pace with Denver's growth, said Greg Fisher, Denver Water's
demand planning manager.
The utility's solution to keep the taps running for 1.5 million customers is expanding Gross Reservoir,
which is southwest of Boulder. But it's a complicated proposal. Not only is the project costly and lengthy
-- $464 million and five years -- it's also not yet a done deal, nor is everyone in support.
The proposal, in the works since 2002, already has sparked one lawsuit. And Denver Water will need
approval this year from commissioners in Boulder County, an area that would receive none of the
increased water security and all of the construction traffic and ecosystem damage.
Those ""no trespassing"" signs even have company in the canyon: ""Stop Gross Reservoir Expansion.""
The project
Gross Dam is 340 feet tall, 1,000 feet long and made from about 800,000 cubic yards of concrete, Raitt
said. It was built in 1954, and for the most part, he added, the glory days of building reservoirs are
decades in the past.
If Gross Reservoir is expanded, it would use another 850,000 cubic yards of concrete to raise it 131 feet
(making it the tallest in the state by a foot) and widening it by 800 feet. Water capacity would increase to
nearly 120,000 acre-feet -- enough for about 800,000 people for an entire year and turning Gross
Reservoir into Denver's second-largest reservoir.
By the time water levels peak in early July, Denver Water's reservoirs will ""recover"" about 180,000 acrefeet of water, Water Resource Engineer Nathan Elder said. About 80% of that will come from snowmelt
and the remaining 20% from rainfall.
At its fullest, Gross Reservoir can currently hold enough water for nearly 300,000 people for a year,
about 6% of the capacity of Denver Water's 11 main reservoirs, Elder said.
But it won't be that full for years, Project Manager Jeff Martin said. If the project gets the green light, the
utility must keep the water level low during construction. Crews will aim to keep the reservoir open to the
public during that time, though, he added, calling the area a ""recreation gem.""
With the lower water level, workers will dig a new, on-site quarry to mine the rock and sand needed for
the extra concrete, Martin said. Tripling the size of the reservoir is no easy feat, and much of that
concrete must be poured at night to keep temperatures cool enough to harden effectively, Raitt said.
Then there's needing to cut about 100 feet into the mountains to the east and west of the reservoir in
order to build it out, Raitt said, calling it ""like building a 40-story building from the side.""
The rationale
Denver Water officials acknowledge they can no longer plan for a constant supply of water year to year
to meet a relatively constant demand.
Ninety percent of the utility's water comes through the South Platte and Roberts Tunnel collection
systems, Elder said, both of which depend heavily on the Colorado River. The remaining 10% comes
from the Moffat collection system, which feeds into the Gross Reservoir and the Ralston Reservoir
northwest of Golden.
It's a lopsided ratio that can be problematic when a drought, wildfire or any other force of nature cuts into
that southern water supply, Elder said. Plus, wildfires can contaminate water and interfere with collection
systems because they burn up underbrush that would otherwise absorb rain and snowmelt.
Denver Water's annual reports show its water collection has remained fairly stable over the past decade,
but Raitt noted humans only have a short glimpse into the state's climatological history. The area has
suffered severe, multiyear droughts in the past.
Colorado State University climatologist Becky Bolinger said even without an obvious local pattern of
drought and climate change, the risk is real. Not to mention, she added, the Colorado River is already
overtaxed by communities in and out of state that rely on it.
Expanding the Gross Reservoir would double Denver Water's reserve capacity in the northern system to
20%, Martin said, a more preferable ratio than the current 90-10 to better safeguard against natural
disasters.
During construction, Martin acknowledged that the system will be more exposed to droughts and fires.
The utility's planning department will likely store more water at the other reservoirs to compensate for
that added risk.
The last disaster, a multiyear drought, started in 2002, Martin said. Utility officials launched into a
conservation campaign with the tagline of ""use only what you need."" It worked.
By 2016, Denver Water customers had reduced their per-person water consumption by 22%, Fisher
said, effectively offsetting demand increases from the new arrivals to the city. In that time, the utility
added 17,035 active taps to its service area and tens of thousands more people moved to the area,
annual reports and U.S. Census Bureau data show.
Conservation just isn't enough to make up for that still-increasing demand. And by 2026, there'll be
70,000 more people in Denver Water's service area, spokesman Todd Hartman estimated.
""The early 2000s rut was our early indication. It really woke the entire state up to growing water scarcity,""
Fisher said. ""Without (the) Gross (expansion), we are taking on, and our customers are taking on, too
much risk. We don't have the water security to meet our customers' needs.""
The opposition
Utility officials began looking into expanding the Gross Reservoir during the multiyear drought, knowing it
was built to be expanded. And the pushback began almost as immediately.
Arguments against the expansion largely fit into two categories: local complaints and big-picture
concerns. Bev Kurtz, president of The Environmental Group, fits into both camps.
Her home rests near the existing reservoir's north shore, and she and her neighbors would undoubtedly
suffer annoyances and more for years from the constant construction. There'll be construction lights all
night, year round, and noise pollution from trucks and helicopters ferrying materials to and from the site.
Kurtz said she fears air pollution and more, too, considering crews must dig the quarry, pour concrete
and cut down tens of thousands of trees.
She is one part of a coalition -- including Wild Earth Guardians and the Sierra Club -- that sued the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers in 2018 in U.S. District Court in Denver to block the project. A federal judge
dismissed that lawsuit in late March, though Kurtz said she wants to appeal.
Raitt acknowledges her concerns and others' are real, but reiterates the project is necessary for the
Denver metro's long-term survival.
Bob Bartusiak, who moved a few miles south of the reservoir in November, said most of the opposition
he's heard about focuses on the traffic along Gross Dam Road. Many people walk the road during the
day, and the quiet nights would be interrupted by hundreds if not thousands of trucks.
That's an argument Jeff Fisher said he's heard repeatedly since moving to his home on Crescent Park
Drive near Gross Dam Road in 2011, but thinks it's selfish to outright oppose the project.
""You've got to look at the greater good,"" he said, ""and from a high level, it seems like a good thing.""
Boulder County would bear the brunt of all of the construction and environmental damage, and receive
none of additional water security from the expanded reservoir. Kurtz is also unconvinced the project will
succeed once it's finished anyway.
""We're in a 20-year drought,"" she said. ""Even if they do build this, they'll never fill it. There simply isn't
enough water.""
Reservoirs are dated, Kurtz added, questioning whether Denver Water could instead look into other
storage options, such as pouring water back into the large underground aquifer that stretches from
Greeley to Colorado Springs and as far east as Limon.
Hartman countered that aquifer storage and recovery isn't a suitable standalone solution to increasing
demand and water insecurity, though the utility is open to the idea in the long run.
The process
After more than 13 years of work, Denver Water already has the necessary permits for the Gross
Reservoir expansion from federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission and the Office of the State Engineer, Greg Fisher said.
What's left is the permitting process with the Boulder County Commission, Kurtz's last hope to stay
Denver Water's hand.
Denver Water needs from Boulder County a 1041 permit -- something that in recent years generated a
headache for Colorado Springs Utilities, which negotiated a similar permit with Pueblo County for the
$829 million Southern Delivery System water project.
Denver Water CEO Jim Lochhead said the utility applied for its 1041 permit earlier this year and
anticipates approval by fall.
Dale Case, Boulder County's director of Community Planning and Permitting, said the county and the
utility are communicating on outstanding issues in the proposal, a number of which still haven't been
addressed by Denver Water, he said, but didn't give specifics.
""This project has tremendous impacts both environmentally and on the folks that live up in that area,""
Case said. ""There are a lot of issues like transportation impacts, hauling routes, road improvements that
would have to be made. Lots of concerns about the environmental impacts, impacts to neighborhoods,
the tree removal plan.""
The negotiation process must be completed before the permit application goes in front of the threeperson Boulder County Commission for consideration and a public hearing, Case said.
Kurtz said she hopes local opposition can sway the commission to vote against the project, though she
acknowledges a no-vote from the group would more than likely spark a lengthy and costly lawsuit
between the utility and Boulder County.
If the commission does approve the project, Project Manager Martin said construction could begin by
July 2022 and end in the summer of 2027.
Denver's population is already about 30% larger than when the utility started talking about the expansion
and two things are certain: the population is only getting bigger and the state's water supply isn't.

February 2, 2021  La Junta Tribune-Democrat (CO)  Article  Pag e A3
DENVER -- Grand Lake Fire Marshal Dan Mayer never thought the East Troublesome Fire would make it to town.
On the morning of Oct. 21, 2020, the fire was still about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away from the vacation spot on the western edge of Rocky Mountain National Park. The perimeter had crept east at a predictable pace for days. In the worst case, Mayer imagined it would lose momentum against Lake Granby, a large reservoir in the area.
Then the winds picked up.
""You had your expectations,"" he said. ""Then, when you saw it coming, it got scary.""
Mayer would soon witness a blow-up, a moment when a fire expands with dangerous force and ferocity. His sense of surprise wasn't unique, either. The rapid growth of the East Troublesome Fire shocked firefighters and scientists, redefining how quickly Colorado wildfires can grow in an era of rapid climate change.
Only now are scientists beginning to understand the forces behind the firestorm. Their insights could help inform a new set of tools to prevent and predict the most severe wildfires, but their overall assessment is bleak.
As Colorado warms and dries, expect more events like the East Troublesome.
Fires don't grow that fast'
The fire started to shift about a week after first being reported north of Kremmling. As wind gusts hit 60 miles per hour, the mushroom cloud above laid out across the county, smothering Grand Lake in a blanket of thick smoke.
The change was critical. Embers rocketed ahead of the fire line, a behavior known as spotting. Mayer saw it play out himself around 8:50 p.m. After hearing radio reports of the blaze working its way up Highway 34 toward Grand Lake, he saw ""what looked like a small meteor"" land in a field on the western edge of town.
Within about half a minute, Mayer said the fire lit treetops and started to run toward Columbine Lakes, a subdivision west of town. He issued an urgent warning to firefighters.
""We need to get everybody out of Columbine They're gonna get flanked from this fire burning in""
The blaze sprinted through parts of the neighborhood, narrowly missing Grand Lake itself. As the evening wore on, it would jump the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National Park despite the
lack of fuels above the tree line.
When the sun rose on Oct. 22, hundreds of structures had burned and one couple was dead after refusing to evacuate. The fire would incinerate 193,812 acres according to the U.S. Forest Service, making it the second-largest in Colorado history. For Mayer, the most remarkable statistic is how quickly the fire grew. In less than a day, the East Troublesome burned more than 120,000 acres, making it by far the most rapid-fire expansion in state history.
""If anyone would have asked me if it was possible for this fire to grow more than a hundred thousand acres in one day, I would have laughed. Fires don't grow that fast.""
In Mayer's mind, Grand Lake only narrowly avoided a calamity on the scale of the 2018 Camp Fire , which killed 85 in and around Paradise, California. The winds pushed the East Troublesome just past the Grand Lake, not through it. He also thinks the smoke served as a sort of early warning system, prompting residents to leave before authorities issued official evacuation orders.
The speed meant residents and firefighters had almost no margin to react.
""The way that thing came through  you couldn't have stopped it,"" he said.
All the factors...are increasing'
Mayer isn't the only person playing back Colorado's 2020 extreme fire events. In the aftermath of the East Troublesome, Chad Hoffman, an associate professor of wildland fire science at Colorado State University, assembled a team to study the causes behind the state's big blow-ups.
""The idea is that can help us predict when they're going to occur and maybe even help us figure out ways to deal with them moving forward,"" Hoffman said.
While the team is just getting started, it's already clear fast fires are a big reason more acres are burning across the state. The team used satellite imagery from 2002 to 2020 to build a database of fires in the Southern Rockies. The region includes all of Colorado's mountains along with parts of Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico.
The results show the fastest-growing fires are also the most destructive. According to the database, 10 percent of all fires which grew the fastest accounted for more than half the total acreage burned.
The basic forces behind blow-ups aren't a mystery. For a fire to get big fast, it needs lots of fuel, lots of oxygen and lots of dry weather.
All of those ingredients were abundant before the East Troublesome Fire.
Colorado's ongoing drought had dried out fuels in the already overgrown forests in Grand County. At the same time, warm temperatures stretched into October, a month when many people in Grand County usually take their first ski runs. The high-wind event on Oct. 21 added the final element. Each of those factors has only become more common and extreme in an era of rapid
climate change.
""Not only is it getting drier and hotter, but it's possibly getting windier, which means all the factors that we believe are influencing fire behavior are increasing,"" Hoffman said.
It's less clear whether Grand County's pine beetle infestations fed the firestorm. Over the last few decades, the rice-sized insects have left entire mountainsides draped in dead, red-needle trees. The stands look ready to burn, but one study found fire activity in Colorado hasn't increased in response to the dieoffs.
Jonathan Coop, a professor in forest ecology at Western Colorado University and another member of Hoffman's team, said that doesn't mean beetle kill wasn't a factor in the East Troublesome Fire or other blow-ups. It just means scientists haven't nailed down a connection.
""To what extent the beetle outbreak influenced either the fire spread rates or intensity is still an open-ended question, where the science kind of needs to keep up,"" said Coop.
The skies started turning dark'
Another open question is the role of plumes above big blow-ups.
On the afternoon of Oct. 21, Hopper Becker, a volunteer fire captain with the Grand Fire Protection District, remembered a remarkable change in the cloud above the East Troublesome Fire. The blaze had started burning with enough intensity to create a pyrocumulus cloud, where intense heat lofts moisture into the upper atmosphere to condense into thunderheads.
From his day job at the county sanitation plant, Becker said the cloud looked like a ""big fluffy pile of lemon meringue."" But as he drove home from work, he said it started to press down to the ground and run with darker colors. When he got home, he climbed onto his roof with a pair of binoculars.
""The skies started turning dark. It was like someone took a grease pen and was just smearing it right above the contour of the earth,"" he said. ""It almost looked like an impressionist painting.""
Brad White, the chief of the Grand Fire Protection District, said he had never seen similar fire behavior, but later thought it could have been what experts call a ""column collapse."" The events occur when a plume above a fire falls under its own weight and cool air, supercharging the flames with a rush of fresh oxygen.
""It just really fit the bill,"" White said.
Hoffman, the CSU fire scientist, later examined the early data around the East Troublesome. He said high winds, unconnected to the fire itself, appear to be the main factor behind the fire's rapid expansion. At the same time, he said it's possible strange plume behavior drove the fire at particular moments.
""What that means for fire behavior is a little tricky,"" he explained. ""We know the formation of those clouds are generally associated with extreme stuff, but they can both promote and hinder fire
spread, depending on other factors.""
Either way, those dynamics make it harder for firefighters to predict wildfires. Almost all computer models used in the field only account for how weather affects fire , not how fire can affect weather. A new round of more advanced computer forecasting tools, known as ""coupled models,"" is currently used in laboratories.
T hrough his upcoming research, Hoffman hopes his team can identify when advanced models could be more helpful to firefighters.
We live in burnable landscapes'
Even if fire scientists learn to predict when blow-ups are likely, they won't be easy to prevent.
Camile Steven-Rumann, a Colorado State University fire ecologist and another member of Hoffman's team, said society needs to shift how it understands the problems presented by fires. Rather than trying to stop it, she said the goal should be to encourage less severe blazes.
""You could have a lot of areas burned, but if all of that is burning at a low severity, you don't see a lot of the forest change,"" she said. ""We have a greater potential for tree survival  and those landscapes we love continuing to be there.""
The shift won't be easy. Stevens-Rumann said authorities would need to conduct far more prescribed burns, which could reduce fuels ahead of a big blow-up. In particular, she said it'd be wise to simply let natural fires burn if they don't present an immediate danger to human life or the environment.
""We live in burnable landscapes,"" said Stevens-Rumann. ""And they're only getting more burnable.""
The East Troublesome Fire has reinforced a similar conclusion for Fire Chief Brad White. It showed him there's often not much a fire department can do when presented with a truly ferocious expansion. Looking out on Elk Mountain, where the fire grew before sprinting toward Grand Lake, he pointed to all the land still primed to ignite.
""We probably need to be looking at prescribed burns that are in the thousands of acres,"" he said. ""Those kinds of efforts are going to be what keeps the bulk of our communities safe.""

Durango plans citywide composting service  Program aims for.txt,"Durango plans citywide composting service - Program aims for
100% resident participation

The city of Durango is digging into a citywide, curbside compost collection program as part of its
environmental sustainability goals.
Durango is trying to meet its benchmarks, set for 2030 and 2050, to reduce its greenhouse gas
emissions and increase use of renewable electricity. The city's effort parallels similar goals around the
world intended to combat climate change. A compost service for city residents is one step toward
meeting those goals, according to the city.
""Ultimately, the goal is to get as close to net zero waste emissions as possible,"" said Imogen Ainsworth,
the city's sustainability coordinator.
In 2019, the city of Durango decided to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030 and 80% by
2050, compared to 2016 levels.
In 2016, solid waste disposal accounted for about 5% of the city's emissions, according to city
documents.
Composting wasted food and other organics, however, significantly reduces methane emissions,
according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Greenhouse gases, like methane and carbon dioxide, trap heat in the atmosphere. The gases lead to
climate change depending on their concentration, longevity in the atmosphere and heat-trapping
characteristics of each gas, the EPA says.
For Southwest Colorado, impacts of climate change are expected to include decreased precipitation,
droughts, increased heat, insect outbreaks, increased wildfires and reduced agricultural yields, according
to NASA.
Greenhouse gases occur naturally and through human activities such as agriculture, fossil fuel use for
transportation and electricity, and waste from homes and businesses.
Anaerobic decomposition of waste, like organic material in landfills and wastewater, produces methane.
The radiation-trapping effect of methane is 25 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period,
according to the EPA.
In Durango, about 20% of residential and 26% of commercial waste in Durango is food waste. About 27%
of residential waste is made up of other organic material, including yard waste, according to a 2015
waste audit.
The city plans a five-year launch of its composting service, which will be operated by a private waste
hauling and composting company.
It has already called for bids from potential companies and selected a winning bidder. The bidder had not
accepted the contract as of Thursday, said Tom Sluis, city spokesman.
It was unclear Thursday if Table to Farm Compost, which already operates in Durango, was the bidder
for the program. Table to Farm offers curbside composting for residences and businesses in the
Durango area.
The public-private partnership would include educational outreach to the community. Once collected,
appropriate waste material would be composted at a certified compost facility.
The service would initially be voluntary for city residents and businesses. The city aims to scale up to
100% participation for residential customers over the first three years of the program.
The program would not be a free service for residents and businesses. However, in its request for bids,
the city emphasized developing an accessible fee and funding structure for low- to moderate-income
households and possibly for independent minority-owned businesses.
""Providing opportunities for food waste diversion while ramping up education around existing recycling
programs and opportunities for waste reduction will be critical to reducing solid waste emissions and
achieving community greenhouse gas emissions goals,"" Ainsworth said.

Thanks to the Colorado Independent Congressional Redistricting Commission, Summit County voters
may have a new representative in the U.S. House in 2022. Most likely, we will not be in the 2nd
Congressional District represented by Democrat Joe Neguse from Boulder. Horror of horrors, our new
representative could be Lauren Boebert, a QAnon Republican from the 3rd Congressional District.
How did this happen? Redistricting happens every 10 years if a state has a shift in population. When a
state's population grows enough, a U.S. congressional seat is added to ensure residents are properly
represented in the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. As many of you know, Colorado
has grown enough to add a new congressional district, which is forcing realignment of current districts to
accommodate the growth or decrease of population in each county. This is normally done by the state
legislature.
However, Colorado's redistricting process is unique. Colorado is one of the first states in the country to
approach redistricting by using an unelected-citizen commission. Previously, Colorado used the same
process as other states when adding or reducing congressional seats. If your political party had control
of the Legislature at the time of redistricting it was wonderful, but there were frequent calls of
gerrymandering on both sides of the aisle. Hoping to eliminate gerrymandering, Colorado voters passed
Amendment Y in 2018. This new law transferred the power to redraw the congressional districts from the
Colorado Legislature to a newly created Independent Congressional Redistricting Commission.
Is this good news or bad news for Democrats in Summit County? Well, it is what it is Per the Colorado
redistricting website, along with having an independent commission the law requires that districts be
contiguous and, along with many other requirements, members cannot protect incumbents, declared
candidates or align with any political party.
Ian Silverii, a redistricting expert who worked on the process in 2011 and is currently working on the
2021 redistricting, said, ""members of the commission are required by the Colorado Constitution to
adhere to the requirements specified by the law when deciding how to draw the congressional districts.
Political party interests cannot influence them.""
During the next year, there will be community meetings for the commission to hear feedback from
residents about the proposed plan. On Saturday, July 31, Summit County residents can participate in a
hearing at the Summit County Community and Senior Center in Frisco. Many experts, including Silverii,
believe these community input meetings will result in the proposed redistricting map looking much
different by next year. Unfortunately, Summit County voters  terrified by the thought of a gun carrying,
climate change denying, self-identified QAnon supporter representing them in the United States
Congress  need to accept the fact that districts must be contiguous. If you look at the proposed
redistricting map, Summit County sits in a location where it can't easily be moved out of the 3rd
Congressional District, even if the voters don't agree with the representative's politics.
Perhaps the smarter argument would be to convince the commission to move the more conservativeleaning, agricultural Fremont County to the 4th District and put the liberal-leaning, tourist county of
Saguache in the 3rd district.
Patti McLaughlin, chair of the Summit Democrats, recently said, ""Summit relies on tourism, not
agriculture. I believe the focus for the 31st is to elevate drawing districts that better reflect communities of
interest.""
In the end, Summit County Democrats may do the entire country a favor by contributing to unseating one
of only two QAnon supporters in Congress. Summit County voters alone could change this situation.
According to the registration numbers provided by the Colorado Secretary of State's Office, Republicans
outnumber Democrats in the new 3rd Congressional District by a little over 10,000 voters, and
unaffiliated voters outnumber Republicans by over 10,000 votes. With Summit County's 6,600 registered
Democrats and over 10,900 registered unaffiliated voters, a well-developed voter registration drive and a
strong candidate like Kerry Donovan, the Democrats can win this seat. Donovan is a Colorado native
and a rancher who currently represents Vail in the Colorado Senate. Best of all, she is not part of a farright conspiracy theory cult, and she is a better representative for our county

Durango survey offers insight into wideranging water issues .txt,"Durango survey offers insight into wide-ranging water issues Questionnaire invites community feedback about numerous topics
March 16, 2021  Durango Herald, The (CO)
Author: Shannon Mullane; Durango and Pine River Valley reporter Section: Local News 955 Words
OpenURL Link
Durango community members have a chance to weigh in on water issues  such as supply, quality and
conservation  as the city of Durango updates its future water plans.
Water is not a guarantee for Durango. Residents spend the winters wondering if the mountains will see
enough snow and the summers gauging river heights and the likelihood of wildfires. The lack of backup
systems and water storage weigh on city leaders and experts.
City staff members aim to complete water master plan revisions in June, and the community has until
April 5 to weigh in on the discussion through an online survey.
""We knew we wanted some public outreach and user sentiments on how people think about water,"" said
Jarrod Biggs, Durango's assistant utilities director. ""This one (survey) is a baseline. ... What do people
think about water? We think we know, but this is an opportunity to actually check with the community.""
The water sentiment survey, found at durangogov.org/vch, dives into some basic and big questions
facing Durango and its residents.
Durango survey offers insight into wide-ranging water issues
As of Monday, 115 community members had offered feedback about issues such as the reliability and
safety of their tap water, water rates, environmental issues facing Durango's water, water conservation
and water shortages.
Those responses will help guide city staff members as they make revisions to the water master plan,
Biggs said.
Only 40 responses, those who are registered for the Virtual City Hall, were visible to the public Monday.
So far, the vast majority were happy with the reliability, safety and quality of their water service 
although they were slightly less enthusiastic about their trust in the government to handle infrastructure
and regulation.
But the majority also said they felt somewhat or very vulnerable about the possibility of shortages.
They're worried about the impacts that environmental factors, such as wildfire ash, mine spills and
drought, might have on the supply.
Those concerns are valid, said Gigi Richard, director of the Four Corners Water Center at Fort Lewis
College. When asked about the biggest issue facing Durango's water supply, she said: climate change.
""There's a critical connection between increased temperatures and decreased supply,"" she said.
""Supplies are being used to their limit already. If temperatures increase, and that results in a decrease in
supply, that stretches the resource even more.""
Evidence is accumulating that increased temperatures are tied to environmental impacts on water, such
as declining stream flows or more prevalent wildfires, the ash from which can affect water quality and
supply, she said.
""As we know in Colorado, we have these crazy extremes in our water years,"" Richard said. ""Designing a
system that is resilient to those kinds of extremes and that kind of variability is critical. One of the ways
to build that resilience is to have storage.""
Stored water allows the city to have more flexibility in the timing of when it distributes water to the public.
But it quickly gets complicated. Durango stores water in a city reservoir and owns water in Lake
Nighthorse. But no pipes connect Lake Nighthorse to the city's drinking water treatment facility at College
Mesa.
That piping would allow Durango to have redundancy, or a duplicate system, in case something goes
wrong, like a serious wildfire.
But all of that water would still flow through one water treatment facility, which would also need to be
addressed for the city's water system to be more resilient, Richard said.
""If something were to happen with that one system, we don't have any redundancies,"" she said.
The city is aware of this issue, said Biggs and Mayor Dean Brookie. City Council and the city's
infrastructure advisory board will meet March 24 to discuss costs and infrastructure plans.
""We know there's less water in the rivers. One of these days, we're going to want to use and need to use
that Lake Nighthorse option,"" Biggs said.
Durango survey offers insight into wide-ranging water issues
Brookie also listed accessing Lake Nighthorse as one of the top issues facing Durango's water system,
alongside environmental factors.
""There is some consideration of not building a new water treatment facility,"" Brookie said. ""I think that
would be incredibly short-sighted for the city of Durango, not only for our current residents but also future
growth opportunities.""
But residents also have a role to play, particularly when it comes to drought, said Brookie and Richard.
Durango's water use quadruples in the summer because of increased irrigation, primarily because of the
city of Durango, the Durango School District 9-R and Fort Lewis College, Brookie said.
""We've really got to figure out ways for the 'Big 3' to do a better job of recycling water and have more
unique drought-resistant landscapes in the future,"" he said.
In urban areas, the biggest water use is for outdoor watering, Richard said. For homeowners, that might
mean different styles of xeriscaping and changing irrigating practices.
According to the survey results so far, community members are supportive of the idea  90% preferred it
over other ways of reducing water use.
""We're all in this together,"" Richard said. ""To achieve a resilient water system, we all need to play our
part.""

Glenwood Springs City Council candidates both want to see change in their city, with incumbent Shelley
Kaup wanting to see more affordable housing while her challenger, Ricky Rodriguez, wants to see more
community events.
That was one of the topics discussed by candidates during Monday evening's virtual candidate forum.
Kaup's seat is the one contested in the April 6 city election. Ward 5 representative Jonathan Godes and
Ward 2 representative Ingrid Wussow are up for reelection but face no challengers on the ballot.
""I think the cost of housing is off the charts,"" Kaup said when asked what change she wants to see
happen.
Kaup noted how prices have only increased while supply has gotten tighter in the city's housing market.
Kaup said she wants to find ways to encourage affordable housing to at least ensure the city's workforce
has a place to live in Glenwood Springs.
""I know not everybody can live here but I would love to see that change,"" Kaup said.
Rodriguez said he would work to bring more community events to Glenwood Springs.
""I want to do more things in the community so people can get out there more, "" Rodriguez said.
""I would like to utilize our mountain bike trails and utilize the airport a little bit more,"" he said adding that
Glenwood Springs is more of an adventure community and he wants to emphasize that.
""One of the best ways of bringing people together is an event. Whether we can sell their food, vendors,
we could bring music,"" Rodriguez said.
When the candidates were asked how they would approach lifting the mask mandate, Rodriquez said his
message would promote healthy life choices overall.
""I wanted to put a different message out there. For individuals to start taking into account that they have a
lot to do with what's going on. I want people to be healthier to feed your body better, move your body
more and just more healthy in general,"" Rodriguez said.
Kaup would have a different approach that would rely on statistical evidence.
""As more and more people get vaccinated throughout the community and certain percentage of people in
the county that have experienced disease, I think if we reach a metric that shows thatherd immunity
number, that's something we certainly could consider,"" Kaup said.
When it comes to wildfire prevention and control, Kaup said that's a tough and challenging topic.
""The state's been in an extended, extreme drought. Our fire department does do work with residents
along the edges of town to do fire mitigation and cut the undergrowth back. Long term for me we need to
address climate change, because it is a driver of this drought,"" Kaup said.
Kaup added addressing wildfire concerns includes ensuring the city's water system is strong and that
the boundary of the city is distinct so the infrastructure is in place to fight a wildfire.
Rodriguez said he would focus on a public campaign that informs travelers of the fine they'll face for
throwing out cigarettes while driving through the area.
""It seems like people are always flicking out cigarettes. I'd make it a priority, so people know if they get
caught throwing a cigarette out they know there'll be a big fine for that,"" Rodriguez said.

With an eye on wildfire risk, Durango City Council is looking into a new fire mitigation funding method  one that received legislative support Tuesday.
The funding strategy essentially borrows money upfront to pay for forest treatment work that can happen on a larger scale, and faster pace, than work funded through traditional means, like government appropriations.
""The 416 Fire is the kind of fire we might've had historically on this landscape, and that caused a lot of turmoil here,"" said William Baker, a research ecologist, during a study session Tuesday with City Council. ""This is the kind of fire we are probably going to experience, even more so in the future. ... I'm worried we'll have to evacuate the whole community .""
The city of Durango and La Plata County could be the first in the state to participate in the local version, called the Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund. But some key issues, like cost and legal authority, need to be resolved.
The impact fund requires intergovernmental agreements and upfront funding
In March, the county was considering the funding model but said it did not have the legal authority to be part of the Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund authority.
The Forest Health Project Financing bill, which gives counties authority to participate, passed the state Legislature and is awaiting signature from the governor.
The city of Durango said its financial commitments need to be further discussed and defined.
""It's a complex idea that has a lot of opinions,"" said City Manager Jos Madrigal during the study session. ""I think it's a great idea, I just think it's going to take a lot of time for council to wrap their arms around it.""
City councilors unanimously supported forming a council subcommittee to explore the idea.
Councilor Melissa Youssef and Mayor Pro T em Barbara Noseworthy said they would be willing to represent the council. City Council plans to officially form the subcommittee in an upcoming regular meeting .
Fire experts and Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund representatives supported the city's efforts, sharing warnings about the need for evacuation plans, watershed protection and forest restoration.
""How do we manage these 100,000-acre, 200,000-acre fires that we never thought we'd be facing?"" said Jason Lawhon with the San Juan National Forest during the study session. ""It really
does take a unified approach, so we just wanted to show support for initiatives that are looking at this in a comprehensive way.""

When the 416 Fire headed south toward Durango in 2018, firefighters knew they had a place where they might be able to make it turn: the Falls Creek community , said Hal Doughty, Durango Fire Protection District fire chief.
Residents there had been mitigating the landscape since 2002, when the Missionary Ridge Fire and the Falls Creek Fire scorched thousands of acres north of Durango, he said.
""That really was the turning point,"" Doughty said. ""Both for turning the 416 Fire and stopping it, we literally made the fire go in a different direction at that neighborhood.""
The city of Durango is gearing up for its next fire season, and this year, the city is focused on 6 miles of high-risk boundary land  areas where fire mitigation could be key to turning back future blazes.
Durango identifies 6 miles around city limits for fire mitigation
On wildfire risk maps, Durango is bordered by seas of reds and oranges indicating higher-thanaverage wildfire risk. It's a longstanding issue, but the 416 Fire in 2018 shook the city and its land management partners into taking collective action.
In 2019, they formed the Fire Adapted Durango Partnership, which says treating the 6-mile boundary area is a complicated but necessary part of protecting Durango from wildfires.
""We have applied for funds, and we are ready to hit the ground running as soon as snow melts,"" said Amy Schwarzbach, the city's natural resources manager. ""... We've been working on this for a year and a half. T hings feel great.""
Durango identifies 6 miles around city limits for fire mitigation
Populated areas in Durango have a greater risk of being impacted by wildfire than 73% of communities in Colorado.
The city is located in the wildland urban interface, or WUI, where wildfire-prone areas intermix with homes and built structures. Over the last few decades, 60% to 80% of wildfires around the United States have started in the WUI. Most of these fires were caused by humans, Schwarzbach said.
The partnership, a collection of eight regional land management, utility and fire agencies coordinated by the city, aims to decrease that risk.
The partners plan to build on past city efforts to mitigate city-owned lands, nurture healthy forests and watersheds, and support communitywide programs.
For example, the Bureau of Land Management, the largest adjacent landowner to city-owned open space, has made a 10-year commitment to treat 23,000 acres in La Plata County.
Similar commitments from private landowners and other agencies are vital, said Ian Barrett, fire management specialist with the BLM in Dolores.
T hrough the partnership, they can share resources and coordinate their fire mitigation efforts.
""The reason it's so critical is because we each have our spheres of influence,"" Barrett said. ""Every single person, and that includes every resident in Durango, needs to be part of this collective to ensure that we have a positive outcome when we have a wildfire.""
The biggest riskAddressing wildfire risk is multifaceted. It involves prevention resources when there is a fire, public education efforts and removing flammable materials through mitigation.
The partnership is focusing on all of that, but one of its first priorities is securing the city's boundaries. That way a fire on city-owned land is less likely to spread elsewhere and vice versa.
In 2019, the partnership's fire experts and public land managers took stock of the city's boundaries, dozens of miles that would take years to fully mitigate.
Durango identifies 6 miles around city limits for fire mitigation
They looked at worst-case scenarios: days when fuels, like trees and plant litter, are particularly dry, the relative humidity is low, temperatures are high and wind is likely. Days like June 1, 2018, when the 416 Fire started, Barrett said.
""That's your framework: Will a certain area be able to survive a fire under the worst conditions?"" he said.
They focused on areas where a fire could impact public infrastructure, like power lines and water infrastructure, or neighborhoods.
About 6 linear miles became the city's first priority, sections of city-owned boundary land generally located at Horse Gulch, Overend Mountain Park and Dalla Mountain Park.
Durango identifies 6 miles around city limits for fire mitigation
In 2020, the city and its partners mitigated 6,000 feet, with most points 100 feet to 130 feet wide. The city is determining how to do the mitigation work  and how much it will cost. It aims to mitigate the full 6 miles by 2022, although it could take longer, Schwarzbach said.
Not if, but whenThe fire experts and land managers said reducing wildfire risk in Durango needs to be a holistic, ongoing process.
""There's no silver bullet for us to have a good outcome when it comes to wildfires,"" Barrett said. ""We need to eliminate the thought process that we're going to eliminate fires. ... We need to focus
on making sure that we have a positive outcome to that wildfire.""
But fire mitigation projects are easier said than done.
Durango identifies 6 miles around city limits for fire mitigation
The ongoing coronavirus pandemic slowed work on two trails, Powerline and Skyline. Grant money was delayed, and sawyer crews were less available. Crews can't start working until the snow melts, Schwarzbach said.
Mitigation is expensive, especially near homes. City staff members often use grants to stretch taxpayer dollars further, she said. Sharing equipment and crews through the partnership can also save costs, and other city efforts, such as noxious weed removal, contribute to fire mitigation efforts, she said.
But grant-funded mitigation might not be the best management plan, said Barbara Noseworthy, a Durango City Council member who has advocated for more mitigation efforts.
""You want to put it in the budget,"" Noseworthy said. Like the fire experts, she said the next fire is ""not a matter of 'if,' but 'when,'"" and the city has a responsibility to prepare.
""Our natural environment is an incredible resource for our community , and we want to make certain it doesn't go up in flames,"" Noseworthy said.
Durango identifies 6 miles around city limits for fire mitigation
The public's reaction to fire mitigation can throw a wrench in the plan. People grow attached to the plant life around them and might be reluctant to remove any of it. Or, the idea of an out-ofcontrol prescribed burn concerns nearby homeowners.
""T ypically, the least worrisome (options) are most expensive. Least expensive are most risky,"" Doughty said. ""Finding a balance there is a critical element, and it's one of the biggest struggles that we have.""
As the fire experts and land managers prepare for the upcoming mitigation work, they are focused on working with nearby landowners and encouraging them to do their own mitigation.
""It's so important to do the community engagement piece so the residents understand what's going on,"" Doughty said.

Durango_La_Plata_County_look_to_new_funding_model__Durango_Herald_The_CO___March_25_2021.txt,"Durango , La Plata County lo o k to ne w funding mo de l - Durango He rald, The (CO ) - March 25, 2021

The city of Durango and La Plata County could be the first participants in a new way to pay for fire mitigation, but only if big questions can be resolved.
As the city and the county work to address the area's wildfire risk, officials are considering an ""intriguing"" option, the Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund, which would pay for large-scale forest treatment work and offer subsidies to private landowners who want to mitigate.
""It's a great idea, but I have hesitancy about the obligation of the city of Durango,"" said Durango Mayor Dean Brookie during a joint city-county meeting Thursday.
T ypically, mitigation work depends on grants and government appropriations. But the SWIF would essentially borrow money up front to complete a larger treatment program in a shorter period of time.
In Southwest Colorado, the SWIF team proposed targeting key water infrastructure, watershed areas, and high-risk and private land in the wildland urban interface.
By collaborating between government partners, the forest treatment would be more cohesive across boundaries, instead of a patchwork approach.
""The Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund is trying to leverage the dollars we have in the area ... so that we're working together as a community to address foresthealth and achieve our maximum impact in protecting our key resources and community members,"" said Aaron Kemple, who manages the SWIF effort through the Mountain Studies Institute.
The SWIF team said the 416 Fire would have been 70% less costly if a large-scale mitigation effort had been done in advance, based on SWIF modeling of the fire's economic impacts.
The first step in making the large-scale projects possible is creating an intergovernmental authority, with Durango and La Plata County as the possible founding members. The members of the authority would approve treatment priorities and expenditures.
The idea was alluring to Durango City Council members during a March 9 study session.
""The concept of being a role model for the entire state is an interesting concept,"" said Councilor Melissa Youssef. ""It's appropriate that we would be given what happened with the 416 Fire.""
Some of the up-front loans would be paid back by private landowners through a cost-share
contribution, potentially about 40% of the treatment cost on their land.
The members of the authority would also be responsible for repaying bonds. That was a significant concern for local officials: The project would be costly.
The member share would be between $350,000 and $500,000, depending on the scale of the mitigation program. That could go down over time if other members join and grants are approved, according to the SWIF team.
""The financing of this is really complex. And we're still honestly trying to get our heads around it and the risk and what we're actually being asked to do,"" said La Plata County Commissioner Marsha Porter-Norton on Thursday. ""We're not there yet to say, 'Yes, let's go forward with this particular structure.'""
Durango Mayor Pro T em Kim Baxter said the cost for a medium-scale mitigation plan is $450,000, and wondered if there are other ways to more efficiently use that amount of money for local mitigation efforts.
The rural Western Slope rarely gets prioritized enough for resources at the state level. That's why going local is better, said Ellen Roberts, a former state legislator, during the March 9 presentation.
""$450,000 is a lot of money, but when you think about the cost of something that would take out Durango potentially ... you have to weigh those things out,"" she said.
City and county officials said Thursday they need more information about the responsibilities and financial commitments for the entities in the authority.
The county also does not have legal authority to agree to be part of the SWIF authority  which is what new legislation, the Forest Health Project Financing bill, aims to fix.
The city and county have unanimously supported the bill, which was passed by the state House of Representatives and was being considered in the state Senate as of Thursday.
""We don't disagree with the goal,"" Porter-Norton said. ""We are in a thought process about are we going to take on too much risk and if that risk is high or not.""

The city of Durango accepted $87,500 in federal funding Tuesday to help pay for fire mitigation efforts this year in the most high-risk areas of the city.
The city, along with its partners in the Fire Adapted Durango Partnership, has taken stock of its wildfire readiness and pinpointed the areas of highest concern: 6 miles of city boundary land. The Bureau of Land Management provided the grant as part of the regional effort to coordinate fire mitigation work around Durango.
""This is an effort that's going to take everyone in our community. It's going to take all of the municipalities. It's going to take the county,"" said Ian Barrett, a BLM fire management specialist, during a City Council meeting this week. ""It's going to take the BLM and other federal partners to really help Durango and the surrounding area have a good outcome from wildfire.""
The grant, which the City Council unanimously accepted Tuesday, has a four-year duration. This year, the city will receive $87,500. The award can be modified each year for up to $250,000, depending on the availability of funding, city staff members said.
In 2021, the grant will support mitigation work along sections of city-owned boundary land generally located at Horse Gulch, Overend Mountain Park and Dalla Mountain Park. The city aims to complete all 6 miles within the year, staff members said.
""Last year was definitely a formation year if you will. There were some hard lessons learned. Those are common when you start these programs,"" Barrett said. ""I do believe they're poised to be able to execute that (project).""
The BLM is also exploring opportunities to develop an agreement with Durango that would allow it to conduct cross-border fire mitigation on city land at no cost to the city.
""Under the good neighbor authority, assuming that we've met all the regulations and federal planning requirements, we can eventually extend treatment across boundaries or vice versa,"" Barrett said. ""It would improve the process and cohesiveness of these improvements.""
The BLM is the largest adjacent landowner to city-owned open space, managing 23,000 acres in La Plata County.
The agency has conducted extensive fuels treatment over the last 20 years, particularly around Animas City Mountain, Grandview Ridge and Perins Peak State Wildlife Area.
In a recent environmental assessment, the BLM identified 5,800 acres of previously treated land that would be eligible for retreatment.
The Colorado State Forest Service, Durango Fire Protection District, Wildfire Adapted Partnership,
La Plata County, La Plata Electric Association, private landowners and San Juan National Forest are also involved in managing lands around Durango.

The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad embarked on an extensive fire mitigation project this spring, selling downed timber to a logging company, but was told to put the effort on hold by the U.S. Forest Service after concerns were raised about the amount of trees being cut down.
John Harper, general manager of American Heritage Railways, which owns the D&SNG, said the railroad took the opportunity of the COVID-19 shutdown to redirect staff to work on the treecutting project.
The project's focus area is the 100-foot right-of-way on each side of the railroad's tracks from the Cascade station to Silverton as the D&SNG cuts through the San Juan National Forest .
Harper said the project started in April, with the railroad cutting down and removing anything that may help fuel a wildfire or cause a derailment within the D&SNG's right-of-way.

Downed trees, Harper said, were sold to the Dolores-based IronWood Mill, which the D&SNG contracted to cut down.
The D&SNG was able to complete 8 miles of the project before the Forest Service learned of the scale of the project and sent the railroad a cease-and-desist order May 27.
""Members of the public and Forest Service resource specialists have raised a number of concerns about ... clearing activities currently being conducted along the railroad right-of-way,"" San Juan National Forest Supervisor Kara Chadwick wrote in the cease-and-desist order.
Harper said people who have been hiking in the area have criticized the railroad's work as a massive logging operation. He said the D&SNG did not inform the Forest Service of its project because the railroad isn't required to notify the agency of work in its right-of-way.
""There's been some misrepresentation because people consider it logging,"" Harper said. ""But any salvageable timber was taken out of the canyon so it could be put to good use rather than be disposed of or wasted.""
But Chadwick maintained that while the D&SNG has authority to maintain its right-of-way, the track crosses and is adjacent to National Forest lands, and federal law requires the railroad to inform the agency of any work that may go beyond routine maintenance.
""The regulation requires you inform the Forest Service in order to obtain a determination that the work is routine ... and is therefore exempt from permit requirements,"" she wrote.

Mark Lambert, with the Forest Service, said the agency has heard reports of large and old trees that were cut down, and that slash piles have been left on the side of the tracks.
""That's one of the things that led us to want to get an idea what happened out there,"" he said. ""We just need to get a better idea.""
Harper, for his part, said the D&SNG's project is for the safety of the railroad, its passengers and the forest in preventing wildfire and derailment. He noted the community has called on the railroad in recent years to do more to prevent fires.
""One of the chief complaints we hear is about fire mitigation,"" he said. ""And now we're actively mitigating and people are concerned and upset about it.""
Selling the timber helps offset the costs of the fire mitigation, and is not intended to make a profit, Harper said. He also noted the D&SNG financial difficulties during the past few years with shutdowns forced by fires and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The D&SNG is also involved in three separate lawsuits that seek to recoup millions of dollars in damages related to the 416 Fire, which the Forest Service says the railroad started in June 2018.
""A project like this costs hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" he said. ""No revenue is being made on removing timber. That timber is being removed for fire mitigation and to prevent derailment.""
In her letter, Chadwick said the Forest Service is generally supportive of any efforts toward fire mitigation, but is concerned it was not notified of the project and that ""not all of the work completed to date is reasonable and necessary to address wildfire concerns.""
She cited one area between the Cascade station and the Needleton stop that is ""arguably more susceptible to ignition and the spread of wildfire than it was before the work started.""
""I understand that there is a plan to deal with the slash and debris left behind eventually, but given the extreme drought conditions ... I am concerned about the new risks that exist in that area.""
Esther Godson, spokeswoman for the Forest Service, said Thursday the situation remains under investigation and the agency has no further comment at this time.
Harper said there are three phases to the project: removing weeds and brush next to the track;
removing large vegetation and trees within the right-of-way; and eliminate fuels piled on the forest floor that present a fire danger. All slash piles will be removed or burned in a controlled manner, he said.
""We're not removing all of the trees, but there are certain areas considered high-hazard areas where we removed a large amount,"" he said. ""We've never done something this big. This is a significant mitigation project.""
Harper said the D&SNG hopes to resume in July.
""We are going to continue north toward Silverton,"" he said.

The city of Durango and its partners will focus 2021 fire mitigation efforts on 10 different areas in Dalla Mountain Park, Horse Gulch and Overend Mountain Park.
The land, totaling 36 acres, makes up key sites where fire mitigation is needed and could help control future fires, according to the Fire Adapted Durango Partnership. The partnership and its mitigation efforts were born out of the 416 Fire  a new, collaborative way to address fire risk around Durango.
""The goal in these zones is to reduce the risk of a wildfirespreading out of control,"" said Amy Schwarzbach, Durango natural resources manager, during a City Council study session Tuesday. ""So in some of these areas, the safest thing to do is reduce how tall flame lengths would be, alter how fire would behave, and then continue our planning over the future years.""
The Fire Adapted Durango Partnership consists of groups that share boundaries with city open space and are trying to coordinate their fire management efforts. Those eight entities include land managers such as the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, utilities, fire agencies and Durango residents.
The partnership zeroed in on 6 linear miles of city boundaries by looking at the vulnerability of plant life, how different landscapes might shape fire behavior and where a fire could affect public infrastructure or neighborhoods.
This year, the partners plan to mitigate 36 acres: 10.2 at Dalla Mountain Park, 13.2 at Overend Mountain Park, 4.7 at Animas City Mountain and 7.9 at Horse Gulch. In 2020, they mitigated 9.6 acres at Horse Gulch.
Durango zeros in on 10 areas for fire mitigation
Part of the reason the partners chose those areas is because they are next to 215 homes, apartment buildings and other structures that would be at risk if a fire were to spread out of control, Schwarzbach said.
Hal Doughty, fire chief of the Durango Fire Protection District, said community members might have concerns that the project will clear-cut all growth, remove privacy screening offered by plant life, diminish wildlife habitat and cut down all the trees.
""That really is not the case,"" Doughty said.
The mitigation teams aim to balance removing fire-prone plant life, or ""fuels,"" with the aesthetic value, privacy screening and erosion control offered by remaining plant life, said Mark Loveall, supervisory forester with the Colorado State Forest Service, another member of the partnership.
""Vegetation for wildfire hazard mitigation is not a one-size-fits-all undertaking,"" he said.
While the city can take on mitigation work on public lands, private landowners have an important role to play, said Charlie Landsman, La Plata County coordinator with another partner, the Wildfire Adapted Partnership.
The Wildfire Adapted Partnership can offer one-on-one consultations to help landowners develop an action plan, Landsman said.
The city plans to ask companies to bid on the 10 projects in March and April so the mitigation work can start as soon as the snow melts and the land is ready.
Interested members of the public can learn more about the city's plans at a virtual meeting from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. March 31. A link to the meeting is available at DurangoGov.org/zoom.

For many of us, the current drought in Western Colorado is the worst we've seen in our lifetimes, and the outlook isn't great for the coming summer.
Joel Lisonbee is the Drought Information Coordinator for the National Integrated Drought Information System, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Lisonbee said drought conditions have been improving in Colorado, but primarily on the eastern side of the Continental Divide. Lisonbee noted that current 90-day outlooks aren't good for temperature, precipitation and drought tendency.
That's going to affect foresthealth, stream health and water supplies.
Eagle River Watershed Council Director Holly Loff said the lower runoff expected this spring may not give local streams enough water to self cleanse as they do during more normal years.
Runoff translates to more water, moving faster than normal. That flow can clean out stream beds, including the small spaces between rocks. That's where insects reproduce. Fewer insects means less food for fish.
Combine that with expected warmer summer temperatures, and local fish populations will strug g le.
Even if local snowpack was normal, soils throughout the region are parched from a dry summer and fall in 2020. Snowmelt will soak into the soil before much of that water reaches local streams.
Fire season could be rugged
Drier-than-normal conditions can also contribute to active fire seasons. Fire officials across the region are gearing up.
Eagle Holy Cross Ranger District District Ranger Leanne Veldhuis said her office has hired a fire prevention officer for this year, and has added two positions to its Front Country Ranger program.
Education is going to be a big part of those employees' jobs.
Velduis said the fire prevention officer will focus on community outreach, patrols and public outreach.
Front Country Rangers, funded in part by local governments, will also work to help forest users understand the rules about fire safety. Forest Service employees in 2020 put out a number of unattended campfires, some of which were wind-whipped into small wildfires.
""We can't be everywhere at all times,"" Veldhuis said, adding she hopes forest users come to understand the role they play preventing wildfires.
While fire is part of a forest ecosystem, Veldhuis noted that the equation changes when wildfires start due to out-of-control campfires or other causes.
Those fires ""continue to change the landscape,"" Veldhuis said.
In preparation for this fire season, Veldhuis said the U.S. Forest Service is adding resources to be available in case of wildfire.
In Vail, the Vail Fire Department's seasonal wildfire team will show up May 3. That's a couple of weeks earlier than normal.
Paul Cada, the department's wildland fire specialist, said public education is a big part of the department's work. In fact, the department recently announced a program asking residents to complete tasks related to preparing for a wildfire. Those tasks range from signing up for community alerts to improving defensible space around homes.
""Preparedness is our big push in May,"" Cada said. ""It's really the time for folks to (act).""
At the Avon-based Eagle River Fire Protection District, community risk manager and public information officer T racy LeClair said local agencies have been conducting prescribed burns and other mitigation through the late winter and early spring.
It's a joint effort
""We've taken a much bigger role in trying to take on mitigation projects,"" LeClair said. Reducing fuel loads won't stop a wildland fire , but LeClair added that mitigation can help ease the spread of those fires.
It's a team effort to work on fire prevention and firefighting, LeClair said.
""Cooperation is the name of the game,"" she said. ""We can't do it alone.""
A warm, dry summer with below-average streamflows is also concerning news for local water providers.
Eagle River Water & Sanitation District Communications and Public Affairs Manager Diane Johnson in a phone conversation was able to quickly rattle off several drought years in the past 20 or so.
""Droughts are getting more frequent and more severe,"" Johnson said. The goal at the district is to ""permanently reduce"" the amount of water customers use.
Most of that reduction has to come from outdoor watering. Much of the district's water supply comes from local streamflows. More than 90% of indoor water use is returned to local streams after treatment. Only about 25% of outdoor water use ends up back in streams.
Johnson urged district customers to work with their landscapers to cut back on outdoor watering. ""Far too many people are over-using water,"" Johnson said, adding that local landscapers can help calculate how much water a yard needs, or come up with plans for attractive, but water efficient landscaping . All this and more is part of what Veldhuis called ""an all out effort to do the right thing."" That effort includes both residents and visitors. By the numbers 47%: April 26 percentage of the median ""snow water equivalent"" on Vail Mountain. 60%: April 1 water supply forecast for the Eagle River. 32%: Portion of Colorado in ""extreme"" to ""exceptional"" drought as of April 20. 90%: Portion of Utah in either extreme or exceptional drought.

October 24, 2020  Aspen Times, The (CO)  Scott Miller Vail Daily
If you've thought Colorado has had an exceptionally fiery fall, you're right. This may be the beginning of years of extreme fire behavior.
When the East Troublesome Fire in Grand, Larimer and Jackson counties exploded into the state's second-largest wildfire within less than 48 hours, Eagle County Wildfire Coordinator Eric Lovgren first thought the news was mistaken. The reality was shocking.
Lovgren has friends in Grand County. One has definitely losther home to the blaze. Others may have.
And no, this isn't normal -- at least right now.
""The whole state is in either extreme or exceptional drought,"" Lovgren said. ""We're beyond dry.""
That dry weather, combined with wind and fuel conditions, have created volatile conditions that led to hyper-fast growth of the East Troublesome and Cameron Peak fires .
Paul Cada, the Vail Fire Department's wildfire coordinator, talked by phone from Fort Collins, where he was helping on the Cameron Peak fire in Larimer County.
Cada worked for the Colorado State Forest Service before coming to Vail. He spent much of that early part of his career in Grand County. He has several friends who have lost their own homes while fighting the fire.
East Troublesome not unique
But the East Troublesome Fire isn't unique, Cada said.
""What happened in Grand County could have happened in Vail, Aspen or Durango,"" Cada said. ""With forest conditions in the state, we should be expecting these events.""
Part of what's driven the growth of the East Troublesome Fire is tens of thousands of acres of beetle-killed timber. Those trees died about 15 years ago, which means their dried, dead needles have spread across the forest floor. The sunlight those dead trees allow to the forest floor have also allowed the growth of grass and brush.
T ake all that potential fuel and combine it with hot, dry weather, along with possible human carelessness and the conditions are ripe for what Lovgren called ""extreme fire behavior"" -- large fires that grow quickly.
Before this year, the 2002 Hayman Fire northwest of Colorado Springs was the largest ever recorded in the state, burning just more than 138,000 acres.
But, Lovgren noted, that fire took weeks to cover that much territory.
This summer's Pine Gulch Fire north of Grand Junction also took weeks to burn 139,000 acres.
The Cameron Peak Fire in Larimer County has been burning for a couple of months, but grew rapidly in the past couple of weeks. That fire, which still isn't contained, has so far burned more than 206,000 acres.
The East Troublesome Fire is a different beast altogether in the speed of its spread -- and the number of communities it has affected.
Cada was hunting in the area when that fire started. A week later, it had turned huge, and dang erous.
""In my opinion, the moon, stars and wind aligned,"" Cada said.
Eagle County is vulnerable
While Eagle County wasn't hit nearly as hard by tree-killing insects, Cada said dead trees can still create a more dangerous fire.
""It's certainly a major concern fighting fire all across Eagle County,"" Cada said. ""It's something we hammer home will all our firefighters locally, as well as anyone who comes in (from out of the area).""
The focus in Vail and other alpine communities has to be on preparing communities, Cada said adding that governments, property owners and others have to be working now on ways to adapt to new, fire-prone conditions.
""It's everybody's responsibility,"" Cada said.
And there are no quick fixes, Lovgren said.
""T hings are out of whack,"" he said, adding that insects, overgrown forests and a change from ""vegetative"" to ""built"" fuels -- homes and other structures -- has created new kinds of fire danger. And it could take years of normal moisture to return the forests to a less-volatile state.
The final piece, Lovgren said, is ""an abundance of people in the woods.""
Many of those people don't understand the need to be careful with fire.
In an email, Eagle Holy Cross District Ranger Leanne Veldhuis wrote that crews on this part of the forest are finding unattended fires on a regular basis. And, since all the local established campgrounds are currently closed, there shouldn't be any fires anywhere.
No excuses
""At this point, it's well past anybody having the excuse they didn't know,"" Cada said. ""I've yet to see a year where we've (put warning signs) any heavier."" Unattended fires , he said, are ""people who are having a blatant disregard for other people.""
Going forward, people are going to have to be smarter about their own communities and how they behave in the woods, Lovgren said.
Perhaps the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires may lead to some greater awareness.
""More and more people are touched by this,"" Lovgren said. ""Once you have a personal stake, it all starts to make sense.""
The possible silver lining, Lovgren added, is that these fires may bring more awareness and, hopefully some ""big action"" regarding creating fire-resilient landscapes and fire-adaptive communities.""
Cada, though, believes we're in an age of extreme fires , with diseased trees playing an ever-larger role.
""I know deep in my heart that the pine beetle epidemic will be driving my entire career,"" he said.

October 15, 2020  Vail Daily (CO)  James Dilzell The Current
Fire is in the headlines these days, with more than 4 million acres burned to date this year on the West Coast. Our fire season here in Colorado has seen the two largest fires in state history with the Cameron Peak Fire on Wednesday surpassing the Pine Gulch Fire in acreage burned.
Locally, the White River National Forest saw its largest fire in history, with the Grizzly Creek fire that has burned more than 32,000 acres in and surrounding Glenwood Canyon. Thanks to the efforts of first responders, fire crews and management teams, I-70 has since reopened, Shoshone Powerplant has been spared and life has resumed to a somewhat normal buzz. Well, as normal as 2020 can be.
As a headwaters community , there's a lot at stake when it comes to our local rivers -- from a multi-billion-dollar impact on the economy to a river that provides water to 40 million people downstream throughout the West. So, how will a fire like Grizzly Creek impact our rivers and beyond?
The basics
Forest ecosystems and fires have a complicated relationship. Fire is a natural process and can provide benefits to watersheds, such as clearing dead materials, sprouting new growth and releasing nutrients into the soils. Some species rely on instances of fire for survival, such as lodgepole pine. But with today's fires burning bigger and hotter than ever, they can pose a threat to the rivers flowing near those forests.
Fires burn inconsistently, leaving a wide range of burn types throughout each area, but it is those areas with severe burns that often prove most detrimental to watershed vitality. Bill Hoblitzell, a watershed scientist with Lotic Hydrological, shared that in those areas, ""you can get a hydrophobic layer on top of the soil that actually repels water for a little while after the fire comes through. And, you're also losing all your vegetation that holds soil in place over time.""
This combination can cause flash floods, debris flows and sedimentation in the rivers and smaller streams, especially when heavy precipitation events occur. They pose large risks to stream health and safety of the community, damaging infrastructure, choking out a stream and harming the aquatic species. These effects do not necessarily occur right after a fire, but can happen years into the future until ground cover can regrow.
Eventually, those areas of larger rivers, such as the Upper Colorado, that were affected by debris and fine ash will experience dilution of the debris, but Hoblitzell says that ""it tends to be a bigger problem for small streams,"" such as Grizzly and No Name Creeks.
In Glenwood Canyon, communities and human infrastructure are threatened by debris flow events, including drinking water intakes for the City of Glenwood Springs. Addressing these concerns can be challenging and costly.
Impacts of fire retardants
Fire retardants, which are often applied via aircraft, are a critical piece of fire fighting and help tremendously to slow and stop the movement of fire. Containing phosphates, sulfates, clay, thickening agents, water and trade-secret performance additives, retardants dilute the combustible gases of the fuels (wood, debris, etc.) and coat them to create a barrier that limits the release of flammable gases.
These chemicals linger in the environment after the fire, but break down with time. T imm Paxson, a retired chemist and past board member for the Watershed Council says that, ""once broken down, these compounds are useful to the plants. Phosphates are essential to plant life.""
However, too many phosphates can cause algae blooms within a river system, depleting the oxygen and sunlight available to other species. T hus, fire retardants are not allowed to be dropped within 300 feet of a body of water, such as a river.
Beyond the fire
Eagle County faced fire recovery in 2018, with the Lake Christine fire in the hills above El Jebel and Basalt. Though much smaller and impacting a different landscape, we can use the post-fire response in that area as a test case for what steps to take with the Grizzly Creek burn area. The successes here were largely from collaboration with many stakeholders -- something local groups, including the Watershed Council, are already working on in the Grizzly Creek area.
A source of hope that Hoblitzell points out is that ""these natural systems are very resilient, they have been operating for millennia ... and they do bounce back.""
After a year like 2020, perhaps that is a lesson we can learn from our local rivers and streams -- resiliency and the ability to rebound.

Since its inception in 1970, Earth Day is observed every year on April 22 to continue to foster global
consciousness around the state of our planet and our natural resources that keep all living things growing
and flourishing.
Today we find ourselves amid a very real urgency to not only talk about things like climate change, clean
energy, ecosystem changes and extinction of species, but we find ourselves living in a now that needs
each one of us to care about the ways in which we live out our daily lives, and to take what steps we can
to work toward a healthier climate for our future generations.
Without a doubt, the past year has brought extraordinary challenges. Adding on individual responsibility
to help save the planet may sound a bit daunting at the present time, but Walking Mountains makes it
easy to locate resources that can enable us to take small actions in our own daily routines, and every
little bit makes a difference.
Walking Mountains first developed a sustainability initiative called the Climate Action Collaborative for the
Eagle County community in 2018. The central aim of the Collaborative is to empower the community to
reduce local carbon emissions by 50% as we reach the year 2030, and to see an 80% reduction by
With community partners in local governments, businesses, utilities, schools and community
organizations, the Collaborative meets regularly to implement recommended action points through the
Climate Action Plan. This plan serves as a detailed guide for each one of us to utilize in determining what
we can do to help our community preserve a healthy climate and keep our natural environments thriving.
Here are a few things we can do to help:
Waste diversion
* Start composting food scraps and yard waste in our homes and businesses.
* Recycle cardboard either at a free recycling drop site or in your curbside bin.
Transportation
* Leave the car behind once or twice each week and instead walk, bike or take the bus if we're able.
TrendswithBenefits.org is available as an online tool to aid organizations in establishing a remote work
policy.
* Consider Colorado's electric vehicle Incentives.
* Take advantage of local rebates for e-bikes for Edwards residents and Holy Cross Energy customers.
Homes and buildings
* Obtain a home energy assessment to learn about your home's energy use and how we can start to
move away from fossil fuels.
* Change our light bulbs to LEDs and get a programmable thermostat.
* Consider all-electric equipment when the old furnace/boiler breaks.
Renewable energy
* Support Holy Cross Energy's commitment to 100% renewable electricity by offsetting our electric use
with renewable power through their PuRE Program.
* Boost the resilience of your home by adding rooftop solar and battery storage.
Water
* Reduce outdoor water use as much as possible this summer. Read up on irrigation efficiency to
understand our water use and how to optimize it.
* Fix or replace leaky water fixtures.
* Add compost to our gardens to improve soil health and water retention for plants.
Even just one or two tweaks made by an individual can go a long way toward helping the community see
an environmentally healthy future. For further information about the Climate Action Collaborative, visit

East_Canyon_Fire_more_than_79_contained_Six__Durango_Herald_The_CO___June_21_2020.txt,"East Canyo n Fire mo re than 79% co ntaine d - Six - Durango He rald, The (CO ) - June 21, 2020
June 21, 2020  Durang o Herald, The (CO)  Patrick Armijo; Education, business & real estate reporter
Lighter winds and quieter fire behavior during the weekend allowed firefighters to increase containment of the East Canyon Fire to 79% by Sunday evening with the fire growing only 5 acres in 24 hours, but firefighters continue to battle three other blazes in Southwest Colorado.
The fire, located about 2 miles southeast of Mancos, had burned through 2,905 acres as of 8 a.m. New areas of containment include the northwest side that faces U.S. Highway 160 and includes two homes in the Elk Springs subdivision as well as most of the eastern side of the fire along the Cherry Creek Road.
No closures of U.S. Highway 160 occurred Sunday, and travelers can check road conditions online at www.COT rip.org or by calling 511 or (303) 639-1111.
The hot, dry weather shows no relief in sight, and on Sunday afternoon a red flag warning about critical weather conditions conducive to the rapid spread of wildfire was issued for Southwest Colorado from 1 p.m. Monday through 8 p.m. Monday by the National Weather Service.
For Sunday, two hand crews have been moved to the northeast side of the fire perimeter to help with extinguishing hot spots and with securing firelines. Dense Gambel oak and brush in this area slowed containment efforts, according to news release from the Rock Mountain Type 2 Fire Incident Team.
Several hand crews are expected to work on the south and southwest sides of the fire . Crews are pulling large logs near the perimeter to more interior locations to allow them to burn out. The public should expect to see smoke within the fire perimeter until significant rain arrives.
Aircraft remain available to support firefighters as needed.
Critical fire weather conditions remain with high temperatures and lower relative humidity dominating the area.
On Saturday, firefighters completed chipping operations along Cherry Creek Road (County Road 105).
Eight engines patrolled the area through the night, and all observed fire activity occurred within the fire perimeter.
The lightning-started fire, which began June 14 on private land that spread to Bureau of Land Management parcels, has 402 firefighters, including 12 20-person hot-shot crews assigned to the blaze.
No structures have been lost.
Equipment assigned to the fire includes, 23 engines and six pieces of heavy equipment, according to a news release issued Sunday morning by the Rocky Mountain Blue Type 2 Fire Incident Team in charge of fighting the blaze.
The news release added that air operations out of the U.S. Forest Service's Durango Airtanker Base at the Durango-La Plata County Airport are available as needed.
Temporary flight restrictions are in place around the fire banning flights of drones that could interfere with fixed-wing and helicopter tankers battling the blaze.
Sand Creek FireThe Sand Creek Fire, burning in the Piedra Special Management Area in the Pagosa Ranger District, was listed at 50 acres on Sunday morning, but a special team using drones was flying over the fire and expected to have a more accurate estimate of the size of the blaze Sunday evening, said Andy Lyon, public information officer for the Type 3 fire Incident Team managing the blaze.
The fire is burning in a remote area within the burn scare of the Little Sand Fire of 2012, and that has left many standing dead trees and many dead trees on the ground to fuel the fire , Lyon said.
Currently a lighthelicopter capable of carrying a 100-gallon water bucket and a larger heavy helicopter, a Chinook, capable of carrying a heavier load are battling the blaze.
Hearing something overhead? The  SandCreekFire is in a hazardous area, creating safety concerns for firefighters to engage on the ground, so large airtankers are being used. You may spot them as they make frequent passes over the Bayfield community.  FireYear2020 pic.twitter.com/V15KAH 7 jyi
Fire officials are considering seeking assistance from additional aerial resources available at the Durango Airtanker Base, Lyon said.
A Rocky Mountain Type 2 Fire Incident Team, led by T roy Hagan, was ordered to take over the Sand Creek Fire on Sunday afternoon, according to the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, which helps coordinate timely responses and coordination of resources to wildland fires in Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas.
A Type 3 Incident Team, led by Brad Pietruszka, is currently managing the fire.
Because the fire is burning in a special management area, permission is required before retardant can be dropped on the fire, he said.
T hree hot-shot 20-person crews are working the fire, joining 40 people already assigned to the blaze.
Lyon said weather Sunday, like Saturday was hot and dry.
The lightning-sparked fire began June 15 and is burning 21 miles northwest of Pagosa Springs, about 5 air miles north of the Piedra River and 2 miles south of Mosca Road in rough terrain unreachable by vehicles.
Smoke can be seen from Bayfield and Pagosa Springs, Lyon said.
Six Shooter FireThe Six Shooter Fire is now 100% contained, according to a news release issued by Lindsay Box, spokeswoman with the Southern Ute Indian T ribe.
Crews spent Saturday strengthening control lines and mopping up the interior. Fire personnel will remain watching the blaze through Monday, Box said in a news release.
The Six Shooter Fire, reported on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation on June 16, was sparked by lightning and is burning on in Six Shooter Canyon.
The Durango Interagency Fire Incident Management Type 3 Team managed the Six Shooter Fire. Multiple agencies assisted fully extinguishing the blaze.
A total of 110 personnel worked the fire . Ground resources included fire personnel, two crews of firefighters, seven fire engines and one bulldozer.
Oil and gas operations are expected to be able to resume normal operations this week, Box said.
Stage 1 fire restrictions were enacted for Southern Ute Indian Reservation on May 11, and remain in place.
Loading Pen FireThe Loading Pen Fire is still listed at 42 acres and 90% contained on Sunday, said Esther Godsend, spokeswoman with the San Juan National Forest .
""It's well-contained, and we have been able to release resources to other fires and for any new starts,"" Godsend said.
On Saturday, management of the fire was returned to the Dolores Ranger District from a Type 3 Fire Incident Management Team, Godsend said.
""You can still see some smoke from (Colorado) Highway 145, but it's smoldering activity that's well-contained within firelines,"" she said.
Smoke was minimal Sunday, but it might get a bit thicker as winds pick up in the afternoon, she said.
About 40 firefighters remain on scene to mop up and put out hot spots within the fire's perimeter, she said.
The lightning-sparked fire is burning in mixed conifer  Douglas fir, ponderosa, spruce  and aspen.

East_Troublesome_fire_becomes_second-largest_in__Gazette_The_Colorado_Springs_CO___October_22_2020.txt,"East Troublesome fire be co me s se co nd-large st in - Gaze tte , The (Colorado Springs, CO ) - O cto be r 22, 20 20
October 22, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Jessica Snouwaert
The East Troublesome fire more than lived up to its name, growing by more than 140,000 acres in the past two days to become the second largest wildfire in state history and forcing thousands more residents to hurriedly flee their homes, authorities said.
Residents of the small town of Grand Lake on the western side of Rocky Mountain National Park were evacuated Wednesday to Granby and through the park over Trail Ridge Road. By Thursday, the western side of Trail Ridge was impassable -- trees felled by the fire blocked the road, officials said.
Rocky Mountain National Park, a treasured destination for Coloradans and out-of-state visitors, was closed Thursday after the fire spread to the park and to allow for some of the evacuees to reach Estes Park. Their safe haven lasted only hours -- the fire jumped the Continental Divide, Stan Hilkey, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety said Thursday, resulting in Estes Park also being evacuated.
T anvir Malik was among those told to leave Estes Park as the fires sent charred pine needles raining down on the town Thursday. From his store, Eastside Groceries, he was watching lines of cars crawling out of town and debating when to leave.
""Now it's getting crazy. Even if I close right now I can't get out,"" he said.
Growing at a rate of 6,000 acres an hour, the East Troublesome fire blew up overnight from around 20,000 acres to 170,000 acres, driven by gale-force winds that have rarely let up since the fire started Oct. 14, fanning flames in beetle-killed timber stands dried out by drought and and extreme heat throughout August.
""The growth we had on this fire is unheard of,"" said Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin said. ""This is the worst of the worst of the worst.""
Officials did not have a firm number of people who are under orders to evacuate. Although there are 6,500 houses in the affected areas, some are second homes and may not be occupied. Officials believe structures may have been lost, but were unable to say how many.
For Bill and Sue Tomasek, that uncertainty was evident as they switched between hope and fear in one sentence.
""T errible, we're hoping we have a home,"" said Sue Tomasek as the Grand Lake couple waited at an
evacuation center in Winter Park. ""Many of our friends aren't going to be able to go back home, and we're not sure what's going to happen, but as of early this morning our home was there, but we don't know if it'll be there when we get back.""
Mike Morgan, the division director for the Department of Public Safety's fire prevention team, said investigators believe the fire was human caused, but have not made a determination yet.
Scott Jalbert, head of the U.S. Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Area Command, said the East Troublesome fire and the Cameron Peak fire, the largest in Colorado history burning west of Fort Collins, continue to grow and threaten towns and mountain communities.
""We are focusing on life,"" Jalbert saidsiad. ""We do not have enough resources to completely envelope those fires. We are in a defensive mode, protecting what we can.""
One of the concerns is that the East Troublesome and the 206,977-acre Cameron Peak fire will combine into one massive conflagration.
""There's certainly the potential (for East Troublesome and Cameron Peak to connect),"" fire incident commander Noel Livingston said Thursday night. ""... We're not seeing that happen right now. It is a potential, and certainly this year has been one of those years, where those low potential events seem to be happening with high frequencies.""
Fire managers are attempting to move resources from fires that are more under control, including the CalWood fire in Boulder County which forced the evacuation Saturday of the town of Jamestown, to the East Troublesome and Cameron Peak wildfires.
Greg Hanson, of the National Weather Service in Boulder, , said it will be a ""tough go of it"" into Thursday evening, with lots of wind and low humidity. Hanson said a light dusting of snow Thursday night will not provide a lot of moisture, but it will ""wet things down a bit"" and reduce some of the more extreme fire behavior.
Hanson said he's optimistic the fire won't reach Estes Park, but advised people to heed the evacuation orders.
""It's going to be close on the western edge of the city,"" he said.
Saturday, however, is another matter. Very strong winds are expected that will push those fires around, Hanson said. On Sunday, a winter blast could bring a foot of snow at higher elevations. This storm will not be a fire-season ender, he said, but it could allow firefighters to get the upper hand. It will be a short reprieve -- Hanson said he doesn't expect more snow until November.
At a midday news conference Gov. Jared Polis said he has activated the Colorado National Guard to assist with the East Troublesome fire.
""It's humbling for humanity in the face of massive fires,"" Polis said.
Polis made a plea for financial assistance for those impacted by the fires. Donations can be made
at coloradoresponds.org, LarimerCountyFires.com or BoulderCountyFires.com, Grandfoundation.com.
Polis thanked ""the men and women who run toward the flames. Some are professionals, some are volunteers with day jobs who drop everything at a moment's notice,"" as well as those working in emergency operations centers.
He also commented on climate change and how it has increased the danger from wildfires in Colorado. ""We've seen drier, hotter conditions in our state"" as well as a statewide drought and those factors have led to climate conditions that are ideal for rapid growth of forest fires, he said.
Kevin Klein, director of the state's Homeland Security Management, said the first priority is life and safety and supporting search and rescue operations, to ensure residents in the affected areas are accounted for. They're also attempting to secure additional firefighters and fire engines. Klein said 278 hotel rooms have been obtained to house those evacuated, making sure those accommodations meet COVID-19 standards for social distancing.
Unfortunately, the Global Supertanker, based in Colorado Springs, is in use in California. ""We have the ability but we don't have the access"" to it, said Morgan. Polis indicated it probably would not have helped, given how quickly the East Troublesome fire went from 10,000 to 100,000 acres. Hilkey added that they are using a heavy air tanker, and have been deploying it throughout the summer.
Damage assessment will start as soon as possible, Klein said, but that will take time. They will be looking at the impact of the fires on watersheds and critical infrastructure. ""Recovery operations will take time...but we're committed to bringing communities back to the best of our ability,"" he said.

DENVER -- Grand Lake Fire Marshal Dan Mayer never thought the East Troublesome Fire would make it to town.
On the morning of Oct. 21, 2020, the fire was still about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away from the vacation spot on the western edge of Rocky Mountain National Park. The perimeter had crept east at a predictable pace for days. In the worst case, Mayer imagined it would lose momentum against Lake Granby, a large reservoir in the area.
Then the winds picked up.
""You had your expectations,"" he said. ""Then, when you saw it coming, it got scary.""
Mayer would soon witness a blow-up, a moment when a fire expands with dangerous force and ferocity. His sense of surprise wasn't unique, either. The rapid growth of the East Troublesome Fire shocked firefighters and scientists, redefining how quickly Colorado wildfires can grow in an era of rapid climate change.
Only now are scientists beginning to understand the forces behind the firestorm. Their insights could help inform a new set of tools to prevent and predict the most severe wildfires, but their overall assessment is bleak.
As Colorado warms and dries, expect more events like the East Troublesome.
Fires don't grow that fast'
The fire started to shift about a week after first being reported north of Kremmling. As wind gusts hit 60 miles per hour, the mushroom cloud above laid out across the county, smothering Grand Lake in a blanket of thick smoke.
The change was critical. Embers rocketed ahead of the fire line, a behavior known as spotting. Mayer saw it play out himself around 8:50 p.m. After hearing radio reports of the blaze working its way up Highway 34 toward Grand Lake, he saw ""what looked like a small meteor"" land in a field on the western edge of town.
Within about half a minute, Mayer said the fire lit treetops and started to run toward Columbine Lakes, a subdivision west of town. He issued an urgent warning to firefighters.
""We need to get everybody out of Columbine They're gonna get flanked from this fire burning in""
The blaze sprinted through parts of the neighborhood, narrowly missing Grand Lake itself. As the evening wore on, it would jump the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National Park despite the
lack of fuels above the tree line.
When the sun rose on Oct. 22, hundreds of structures had burned and one couple was dead after refusing to evacuate. The fire would incinerate 193,812 acres according to the U.S. Forest Service, making it the second-largest in Colorado history. For Mayer, the most remarkable statistic is how quickly the fire grew. In less than a day, the East Troublesome burned more than 120,000 acres, making it by far the most rapid-fire expansion in state history.
""If anyone would have asked me if it was possible for this fire to grow more than a hundred thousand acres in one day, I would have laughed. Fires don't grow that fast.""
In Mayer's mind, Grand Lake only narrowly avoided a calamity on the scale of the 2018 Camp Fire , which killed 85 in and around Paradise, California. The winds pushed the East Troublesome just past the Grand Lake, not through it. He also thinks the smoke served as a sort of early warning system, prompting residents to leave before authorities issued official evacuation orders.
The speed meant residents and firefighters had almost no margin to react.
""The way that thing came through  you couldn't have stopped it,"" he said.
All the factors...are increasing'
Mayer isn't the only person playing back Colorado's 2020 extreme fire events. In the aftermath of the East Troublesome, Chad Hoffman, an associate professor of wildland fire science at Colorado State University, assembled a team to study the causes behind the state's big blow-ups.
""The idea is that can help us predict when they're going to occur and maybe even help us figure out ways to deal with them moving forward,"" Hoffman said.
While the team is just getting started, it's already clear fast fires are a big reason more acres are burning across the state. The team used satellite imagery from 2002 to 2020 to build a database of fires in the Southern Rockies. The region includes all of Colorado's mountains along with parts of Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico.
The results show the fastest-growing fires are also the most destructive. According to the database, 10 percent of all fires which grew the fastest accounted for more than half the total acreage burned.
The basic forces behind blow-ups aren't a mystery. For a fire to get big fast, it needs lots of fuel, lots of oxygen and lots of dry weather.
All of those ingredients were abundant before the East Troublesome Fire.
Colorado's ongoing drought had dried out fuels in the already overgrown forests in Grand County. At the same time, warm temperatures stretched into October, a month when many people in Grand County usually take their first ski runs. The high-wind event on Oct. 21 added the final element. Each of those factors has only become more common and extreme in an era of rapid
climate change.
""Not only is it getting drier and hotter, but it's possibly getting windier, which means all the factors that we believe are influencing fire behavior are increasing,"" Hoffman said.
It's less clear whether Grand County's pine beetle infestations fed the firestorm. Over the last few decades, the rice-sized insects have left entire mountainsides draped in dead, red-needle trees. The stands look ready to burn, but one study found fire activity in Colorado hasn't increased in response to the dieoffs.
Jonathan Coop, a professor in forest ecology at Western Colorado University and another member of Hoffman's team, said that doesn't mean beetle kill wasn't a factor in the East Troublesome Fire or other blow-ups. It just means scientists haven't nailed down a connection.
""To what extent the beetle outbreak influenced either the fire spread rates or intensity is still an open-ended question, where the science kind of needs to keep up,"" said Coop.
The skies started turning dark'
Another open question is the role of plumes above big blow-ups.
On the afternoon of Oct. 21, Hopper Becker, a volunteer fire captain with the Grand Fire Protection District, remembered a remarkable change in the cloud above the East Troublesome Fire. The blaze had started burning with enough intensity to create a pyrocumulus cloud, where intense heat lofts moisture into the upper atmosphere to condense into thunderheads.
From his day job at the county sanitation plant, Becker said the cloud looked like a ""big fluffy pile of lemon meringue."" But as he drove home from work, he said it started to press down to the ground and run with darker colors. When he got home, he climbed onto his roof with a pair of binoculars.
""The skies started turning dark. It was like someone took a grease pen and was just smearing it right above the contour of the earth,"" he said. ""It almost looked like an impressionist painting.""
Brad White, the chief of the Grand Fire Protection District, said he had never seen similar fire behavior, but later thought it could have been what experts call a ""column collapse."" The events occur when a plume above a fire falls under its own weight and cool air, supercharging the flames with a rush of fresh oxygen.
""It just really fit the bill,"" White said.
Hoffman, the CSU fire scientist, later examined the early data around the East Troublesome. He said high winds, unconnected to the fire itself, appear to be the main factor behind the fire's rapid expansion. At the same time, he said it's possible strange plume behavior drove the fire at particular moments.
""What that means for fire behavior is a little tricky,"" he explained. ""We know the formation of those clouds are generally associated with extreme stuff, but they can both promote and hinder fire
spread, depending on other factors.""
Either way, those dynamics make it harder for firefighters to predict wildfires. Almost all computer models used in the field only account for how weather affects fire , not how fire can affect weather. A new round of more advanced computer forecasting tools, known as ""coupled models,"" is currently used in laboratories.
T hrough his upcoming research, Hoffman hopes his team can identify when advanced models could be more helpful to firefighters.
We live in burnable landscapes'
Even if fire scientists learn to predict when blow-ups are likely, they won't be easy to prevent.
Camile Steven-Rumann, a Colorado State University fire ecologist and another member of Hoffman's team, said society needs to shift how it understands the problems presented by fires. Rather than trying to stop it, she said the goal should be to encourage less severe blazes.
""You could have a lot of areas burned, but if all of that is burning at a low severity, you don't see a lot of the forest change,"" she said. ""We have a greater potential for tree survival  and those landscapes we love continuing to be there.""
The shift won't be easy. Stevens-Rumann said authorities would need to conduct far more prescribed burns, which could reduce fuels ahead of a big blow-up. In particular, she said it'd be wise to simply let natural fires burn if they don't present an immediate danger to human life or the environment.
""We live in burnable landscapes,"" said Stevens-Rumann. ""And they're only getting more burnable.""
The East Troublesome Fire has reinforced a similar conclusion for Fire Chief Brad White. It showed him there's often not much a fire department can do when presented with a truly ferocious expansion. Looking out on Elk Mountain, where the fire grew before sprinting toward Grand Lake, he pointed to all the land still primed to ignite.
""We probably need to be looking at prescribed burns that are in the thousands of acres,"" he said. ""Those kinds of efforts are going to be what keeps the bulk of our communities safe.""

March 11, 2021  Eag le Valley Enterprise (CO)  Vail Daily Staff Report
Crews from Vail Fire and Emergency Services will be conducting prescribed fire operations in late March or early April as conditions allow. The prescribed fire will take place in the Katsos Ranch area of East Vail on approximately 20 acres of town of Vail land and 1 acre, pending approval, of Colorado Department of Transportation right of way.
This project will involve the burning of grasses and scattered brush to improve winter range for the East Vail bighorn sheep herd. The project will additionally reduce wildfire fuels adjacent to the community. Approximately 20 acres of grass on town property above the Booth Creek berm and to the north of the Booth Falls neighborhood will be burned to stimulate new growth and improve forage, plus 1 acre of grass adjacent to the North Frontage Road.
A burn plan has been developed for this project following national interagency fire standards. The plan has been reviewed by a third-party evaluator to ensure all standards are addressed including safety and environmental considerations. The prescribed fire will be conducted in accordance to the written plan.
Prescribed fire operations are dependent on environmental conditions that allow smoke to rise and disperse rather than settling onto Interstate 70 and into residential areas. Operations will occur when there are adequate weather conditions to minimize risks while meeting project objectives. Smoke and flames will be visible from I-70 and some smoke may settle into lower elevations in the evening hours.
The project may temporarily impact traffic on North Frontage Road between Katsos Ranch Road and the East Vail interchange. T raffic is anticipated to be impacted for less than four hours on the day of the burn. Community members are asked to observe the operations from a safe distance and not impede traffic on the frontage road or interstate. A safe viewing location will be at the East Vail interchange parking lot.
The Booth Creek prescribed fire is part of a larger effort to reduce wildfire risks and improve winter habitat for the bighorn sheep herd. Additional work will include mechanical treatment of shrubs and removal of downed logs on nearby Town of Vail lands. A prescribed fire was conducted by Vail Fire and Emergency Services and the U.S. Forest Service in this general area in 2003.
If you would like to be included on future communications related to the Booth Creek burn, please sign up at www.vailgov.com/prescribedfire.
Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health. For more information, go to www.colorado.gov/cdphe/wood-smoke-and-health. Anyone who may have health problems that may be ag g ravated by smoke production should notify Paul Cada with Vail Fire and Emerg ency Services, 970-477-3475.

October 3, 2020  Estes Park Trail-Gazette (CO)  Judi Smith
My grandmother taught me to search for the benefits in every disaster. Sometimes they are difficult to find, but she truly believed in the balance of all things and found a bright side to disaster and a negative inherent in the good things in life. T ry as I might, I cannot find any advantage, for anyone, in the current political circumstances. On the other hand, there are silver linings buried deep within other clouds.
Benefit  1 -- The coronavirus has convinced the world to take a serious look at the causes and effects of what we call ""climate change."" While cities may be great places to interact and may offer a more diversified social landscape, they are, overall, not the best place to live. Most greenhouse gases (GHGs) are produced by the actions of people. Cities have more people. People living in cities have more debilitating respiratory conditions and these have now been, without a doubt, linked to the carbon monoxide, the nitrous dioxide, and the methane that comes from more cars, more buildings (heat and power), more factories, and more trash.
A strange, only mildly expected, experience occurred in connection with sequestering during the early months of COVID-19. The air quality improved Multiple studies during that time period determined that emissions levels fell as much as 75% in some locations. The air over China and India cleared to allow visibility of mountain ranges that had not (at that distance) been viewed for years More recently, an evaluation by the European Space Agency (using satellite photos) has eliminated other possible causes, proving irrefutably that the decrease in GHGs was the direct result of a lack of contributions by mankind. (To see more, try ""Covid-19's Effect on Air Quality Can Be Seen from Space"").
While the GHGs did not create the virus, the air pollution makes the virus more dangerous. While the response of various countries can mitigate the severity, we must also consider ecological endeavors already existing in many foreign countries  and the increase, worldwide, of asthma, COPD, and similar health issues over years of ignoring the problems. The beneficial part of this discovery, and the acceptance thereof: No longer must we sit and watch worsening health issues and wonder why this is happening T O us. We are capable of doing something about the underlying causes of this trend.
While the climate is not the trigger for the current wildfires across the West, all of us listening to the evacuation notices over the last few weeks know that the dry tinder of the forest and the hefty winds common today DO contribute to the level of destruction. The question now is what are we willing to do? Do we pursue economic recovery by changing our habits? Will we invest NOW in renewable energy and replacements for the garbage created by single-use containers? OR will we continue to pay, year after year, for the health and property losses that result?
Benefit  2 -- Another interesting phenomenon may be on the horizon. For the first time in decades, the population in California (and also New York) decreased from the prior year. Now the property values and resulting high rent are beginning to deflate. Is this the result of the oceans encroaching more and more upon the land? Or of constant danger during ""fire season""? Or of too
many power outages? Or of the air pollution in the more populated coastal communities? Possibly. Or it could be a simple result of, ""No job? No home? Let's relocate."" (Still an indirect result of current disasters). Whatever the motivation, this is an economic advantage to the smaller communities welcoming new, often very talented, citizens into their midst.
Benefit  3  It is amazing how clear I can keep my office when everything MUST be packed and ready for evacuation. No more leaving my desk ""as is."" No more starting a new project in the midst of one not yet completed. I wonder if I can make this last  AFT ER the emergency
Benefit  4  I know I am not the only one looking into projects and boxes too long left waiting ""until there is time."" Stating with what MOST should be secured from fire and how, we are reorganizing storage areas and planning for future preparations of fire and flood security. Providing all goes well, this warning could result in advantageous renovations.

The city of Aspen is driven by a noble sense of ""leading the way."" Be it environmental stewardship,
subsidized housing or simply the art of virtue-signaling, the belief that other communities look to Aspen
as a shining example to be emulated is a driving force in local governmental decision-making. As our
new electeds prepare for their goal-setting retreat, the city's department of environmental health and
sustainability recently presented them with some food for thought, specifically appealing to their appetites
for more policies, codes and regulations.
According to staff, despite Aspen's notable efforts to address climate change and reduce waste, our
voluntary climate and waste reduction programs to date have been deemed insufficient to achieve the
community's and council's ambitious goals. While we have reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions 20% since 2004, this is less than the average decrease compared to ""other leading cities."" A
more renewable electricity grid, the result of Aspen Electric becoming 100% renewable and Holy Cross
Energy becoming 40% renewable with the commitment to get to 100% by 2030, has driven this decline,
however, local voluntary programs have kept things stable but have not yielded the necessary
reductions. Apparently the community is set to fall dramatically short of its 2050 GHG reduction targets,
even if our electricity supply becomes entirely renewable.
The next eight years have been deemed critical to reducing GHG emissions globally, and in the same
timeframe, Aspen must reduce waste to close to zero in order to prolong the life of the Pitkin County
landfill. At current rates, we're told the landfill will be full and unusable by 2030. Given that 58% of the
material in the landfill comes from construction activity and 79% of that is generated within the city of
Aspen, clearly diversion, deconstruction and recycling of such materials must be stepped up. But
ostensibly this alone will not get it done. Aspen now needs an additional, bold commitment to ""increased
organics diversion"" to meet its GHG reduction goals.
Today, approximately 5% of Aspen residents and 20% of restaurants choose to divert compost, which is
comparable to what was happening in Fort Collins, Boulder, San Francisco and Portland before they
enacted composting mandates. This is exactly what the city has in mind, and staff is pressing council to
transition our long-standing voluntary programs into ""high impact solutions"" through stringent new
policies and regulations. Goodbye carrot, hello stick. The belief is that a more aggressive and mandated
approach to composting will ""prevent the catastrophic consequences of climate change"" while protecting
the health and quality of life of all residents, reduce methane emissions from the landfill and divert food
waste from trash dumpsters that attracts wildlife.
Enter SCRAPS, the city of Aspen's program to assist residents and businesses in compost collection.
Any Aspen resident can pick up a free 6.5 gallon bucket at the Old Powerhouse building or at the landfill.
Then, through a $18/month subscription with a dedicated compost hauler, organic household waste
including egg shells, coffee grounds and food scraps will be taken to the solid waste center at the county
dump, added to the steaming piles of compost there and eventually sold as a soil amendment.
Assuming that environmental health gets its way and council enacts the bold environmental actions
including mandated composting for both the commercial and residential sectors, you too will need to
master the basics. According to Forbes, even if you live in a small apartment you can easily create a
compost pile. Start with the container. I recommend using the free one from the city, but you can also do
it yourself. Use a large plastic container. Poke holes in it for water to drain. Place a tray beneath the
container to catch the drainage. Keep the compost pile inside or outside of your apartment in a cool place
where it gets plenty of sun. Prep the container by soaking strips of newspaper in water and coating the
bottom. Pour soil over the paper and add worms, one pound of worms for every square foot of container
space. Then toss in your scraps. Each time you add scraps, cover the mlange with more soaked paper
strips. This will help trap odors. Over time, the contents will decompose and you can use the soil in your
garden. But theoretically, you'll be sending it off weekly to the landfill. Either way, sounds exactly like
what you want in your kitchen, right?
I get it. We have to address our aging landfill. But our aggressive GHG emission goals might warrant
revisiting if we are serious about meeting them. The city should absolutely target GHG reductions
through electric vehicles in its fleet as well as with incentives for transit and school buses and consumer
electric vehicles. Improved construction and demolition waste diversion will substantively impact our
shrinking landfill capacity. And the time may be right for building code improvements that support
electrification and energy efficiency. However, mandated residential composting is simply a step too far.
It's one thing to do it voluntarily, or to offer incentives, but something else entirely to compel residents
and tourists alike to ferment food waste in their own homes.
The worst GHG emissions are coming from the unprecedented traffic into and out of Aspen. Why aren't
we addressing that first? Contact TheRedAntEM@comcast.net

Elk_Fire_was_caused_by_underestimation_of_weather__Daily_Reporter-Herald_The_Loveland_CO___March_6_2020.txt,"Elk Fire was cause d by unde re stimatio n o f we athe r - Daily Re p o rte r-He rald, The (Lo ve land, CO ) - March 6, 2020
March 6, 2020  Daily Reporter-Herald, The (Loveland, CO)  Carina Julig
The Elk Fire that burned over 600 acres in Larimer County in October was largely caused by underestimation of weather conditions -- temperatures that were too hot and dry, according to a review of the fire that was published on Monday.
The Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control is required by law to conduct a formal review into the escape of any prescribed fire . On Monday, it released an executive summary of its review into the Elk Fire .
""What we found was that this escape was the result of a variety of complex factors -- some factors that are probably common at a lot of prescribed fires, but which compounded over a very short matter of time on Oct. 16 to lead to this wildfire,"" Colorado Department of Public Safety officer Bobbie Mooney said in a statement.
The fire, officially referred to as the Elkhorn Creek Unit No. 4 Prescribed Fire, began as a prescribed burn on Tuesday, Oct. 15, at the Ben Delatour Scout Ranch in Larimer County. The controlled burn was led by The Nature Conservancy as part of a forest restoration project.
The weather was drier, warmer and windier on the Oct. 16 than it had been the day before, and cloud cover moved off the area in the afternoon, the review said. Several spot fires broke out, two of which began heading toward the Glacier View community.
In the afternoon of Oct. 16, the fire escaped the boundaries of the burn and was declared a wildfire. The Nature Conservancy contacted the Larimer County Sheriff's Office around 4 p.m. and units from multiple agencies responded to the scene. About 50 homes were threatened, and evacuation orders were placed on parts of Glacier View.
The fire burned 628 acres in total, 118 of which were outside the planned boundary of the burn and 82 out of the Scout Ranch property, the report said. One outbuilding was destroyed by the fire, the report said. No injuries were reported. The fire was fully contained by the evening of Friday, Oct. 18.
Many interrelated factors came together to cause the fire's escape, the report said.
An ""inadequate analysis of weather information"" during the prescribed burn led to fire personnel having an inadequate understanding of the weather conditions on the ground. That led to the burn being conducted ""under weather and fuel moisture conditions that exceeded reasonable limits for prescribed fire in the project area,"" the report said.
A lack of involvement from the Division of Fire Prevention and Control could also have been a factor, the report said. Since the division is required by state law to prioritize wildfiresuppression over more proactive activities, it did not contribute to planning or implementing the burn.
In the recommendations section of the report, it suggested that the division's focus may need to change in order to better reduce wildfire risk.
""In the face of an increasingly complex wildland fire environment, the ability to implement proactive measures must be part of a holistic strategy to reduce risk,"" the report said.
The review team commended the project for quickly declaring the burn to be a wildfire once it escaped its bounds and working to suppress it.
A lack of experience among junior personnel working on the prescribed burn led to some delays in the project, the report said. It recommended that The Nature Conservancy develop stronger partnerships with fire agencies in order to have a greater number of experienced people working on prescribed burns.

COLORADO SPRINGS The El Pomar Foundation on Friday announced that its Wildland Fire Fund has granted a combined $50,000 to support the American Red Cross chapters of Southeastern, Northern, Western Colorado and the Mile High Area in their efforts to shelter, feed and otherwise provide volunteer support to people displaced by the state's recent wildfires.
Currently, 14% of the national Red Cross shelter population resides in Colorado, displaced by the Cameron Peak, CalWood, Lefthand Canyon and East Troublesome Fires. Nearly 200 Red Cross personnel across the state are supporting these individuals and helping shelter them in hotels, evacuation centers and non-congregate shelters. As of Friday afternoon, the fires are not contained, and additional evacuations may be necessary.
The Red Cross efforts include providing travel, meals and shelter for disaster relief workers, food, shelter and sleeping/comfort kits for displaced families, and vital support systems such as an online Volunteer Connection portal and emergency vehicle deployment to aid in support operations.
""Since the Wildland Fire Fund was established, El Pomar has been pleased to be able to deploy emergency funding in a number of critical situations,"" said President and CEO Kyle Hybl. ""2020 has presented an unprecedented challenge to those assisting firefighting efforts, which are exacerbated by the pandemic, and we're gratified to be able to provide support to affected individuals where it's so urgently needed.""
Started in 2002, El Pomar Foundation's Wildland Fire Fund assists with the immediate emergency needs of volunteer fire fighting agencies and first responders throughout the Colorado. Since the Fund's inception, it has addressed the needs of volunteer firefighters and first responders across the state, including during the Black Forest , South Fork and Lake George fires, and more recently supported the National Forest Foundation with reforestation efforts following the Grizzly Creek Fire . More information about the Wildland Fire Fund can be found at elpomar.org/grantmaking /el- pomars- funds/.
Donations to American Red Cross for western wildfire relief can be made at redcross.org /donate/western- wildfires- donations.html/.
El Pomar Foundation is one of the largest and oldest private foundations in Colorado. El Pomar contributes approximately $22 million annually through grants and Co mmunit y Stewardship programs to support Colorado nonprofit organizations involved in health, human services, education, arts and humanities and civic and community initiatives. Spencer and Julie Penrose founded El Pomar in 1937.

I would like to invite you to join me in voting for John Hickenlooper for U.S. Senate. I have known John
personally for over 30 years. He was one of the founders of the Chinook Fund, which I had the pleasure
of serving as executive director for ten years. During that time, I got to know John well, and I saw his
devotion to social justice and many of the causes that I hold dear.
I also worked for John when he became mayor of Denver. We created the Denver Office of Strategic
Partnerships to build on his strong nonprofit background and give a voice to nonprofits in the city and
build strategic partnerships between nonprofits, for-profits and the city.
I have not always agreed with John on every issue. However, I know he will represent all of Colorado in
the U.S. Senate. I feel very strongly that we must do everything possible to support him in winning his bid
against the Republican incumbent, Cory Gardner.
John Hickenlooper is ready to take on this position and fight for all of Colorado, including standing up to
President Trump.
I have a fear Trump will once again lose the popular vote but win the election. If this happens, the only
way to put a check on him is for the Democrats to take control of the Senate. Hickenlooper's success
will play a pivotal role in ensuring we are not in this position after the election.
Please join me in voting for John Hickenlooper.

In the debate for U.S. Senate, when the question of integrity came up, I thought of a conversation I had
with John Hickenlooper several years ago. I had testified as an ordinary citizen on a criminal justice bill
and was invited to the bill signing in the governor's office. As I was leaving after the ceremony, Gov.
Hickenlooper stopped me to explain why he opposed my position on another criminal justice issue. We
disagreed then and still do, buthe was honest and straightforward. I had no doubt that his heart was on
the side of ordinary Colorado citizens. Our country will benefit from having a pragmatic non-politician like
John Hickenlooper in the U.S. Senate.

Denver residents should clear the air and vote yes on 2A
This summer, Denver experienced record-breaking heat, smoke, and poor air quality. The western
United States has been on fire and the South is flooding. The impact of climate change is now right in our
backyard.
A Climate Action Task Force, created by Mayor Michael Hancock, spent January through May of 2020
doing research and gathering community input in order to make recommendations to the Denver City
Council and mayor. The work of the task force revealed that if we do nothing, it will cost over $20 billion
over the next 20 years to respond to the impact of climate change in Denver. However, if we spend $3
billion up front, we can mitigate those impacts.
To that end, the city council referred 2A to the ballot. It is a 2.5 cents sales tax on every $10 spent in
Denver to fund this vital work. The advantage of a sales tax is that Denver realizes $6.5 billion from
tourism in an average year, which will spread the cost.
The work of the task force has positioned Denver to take bold climate action. It is estimated that 70% of
carbon is emitted by cities, so cities have a central role to play in the work to mitigate greenhouse gas
emissions. To read the report and recommendations, google Denver Climate Task Force Report.
Join me in support a greener, healthier future for us all and vote yes on 2A.

Enforcing fire restrictions Does the punishment fit the crim.txt,"Enforcing fire restrictions: Does the punishment fit the crime?
July 1, 2021  Aspen Times, The (CO)
Author: Kelli Duncan Vail Daily Section: News 1606 Words
OpenURL Link
The early arrival of Eagle County's first large wildfire of the season last week and, with it, Stage 2 fire
restrictions has resurfaced an inevitable question: What should happen to those who don't do their part to
prevent fires?
The Eagle County Sheriff's Office typically takes an education-forward approach to dealing with people
who violate the county's fire mitigation restrictions, but there are a few criminal charges that can be
utilized in more extreme cases, Sheriff James van Beek said.
""We wrote the (fire restriction) ordinance in such a way as that it's more of an education piece  but it
gives us a set of teeth should we need it,"" van Beek said. ""We approach it from the community policing
standpoint of we need everyone to do their part because we're all part of this community and if everyone
does their part, then that lowers the risk.""
The criminal trial of the two individuals who started the 2018 Lake Christine Fire, which cost over $30
million to contain and destroyed the homes of three couples, was an outlier to how fire restriction
violations are typically handled because of the damages incurred, van Beek said.
In that case, Richard Miller and Allison Marcus each were charged with three counts of fourth-degree
arson, a Class 4 felony, and one count of setting fire to woods or prairie, a Class 6 felony. One charge of
arson was brought against them for each home destroyed.
District Attorney for the 5th Judicial District Heidi McCollum, who was one of the prosecutors on that
case, said prosecutors considered a few key things when determining the charges to bring forward: the
evidence behind what occurred, the intent of the individuals and, finally, the damage that was done as a
result of the alleged crime.
An arson charge is used for crimes that ""have the potential to completely devastate,"" McCollum said.
Ultimately, Marcus and Miller both took plea deals, bargaining the setting fire to woods or prairie charge
down to a Class 2 misdemeanor and pleading guilty in exchange for the dismissal of the three felony
arson charges.
What justice looks like
Arson charges are not a good fit for wildfire cases as arson is typically used to prosecute people who set
fire to houses or cars, often intentionally, Stan Garnett, defense attorney for Marcus, said Tuesday.
The ""setting fire to woods or prairie"" charge is a relatively new concept, passed through the Colorado
state Legislature to provide another option for prosecuting instances when fires are set and then spread
beyond one's own property, said Garnett, who alsois the former district attorney for Boulder County's
20th Judicial District.
In response to the growing threat of wildfires, the state Legislature amended the statute in 2013 to give
prosecutors the option to raise the charge to a Class 6 felony if the situation involves the violation of a fire
mitigation ordinance, Garnett said.
The Lake Christine Fire was a landmark trial in many ways, van Beek said.
It significantly changed public sentiment around what justice looks like when it comes to wildfires. The
destruction and fear caused by increasingly severe wildfires has left the question of a suitable
punishment supercharged with emotion and trauma.
During the trial of Marcus and Miller, Kara Williams, a local resident who was forced to evacuate during
the fire and ultimately losther home, asked the question on the minds of many in the room.
""Is the proposed 45-day jail sentence and hundred thousand dollars in restitution fair for the crimes they
committed?"" Williams asked. ""Honestly, that's a hard question for me to answer. I do appreciate that
these specific punishments represent, in part, some of the suffering my family has endured. When they
go to jail, they'll be forced from their homes like we were.""
""Public sentiment matters to every community,"" McCollum said, but the District Attorney's Office files
charges based on interpretation of state statute, not based on what the public wants.
That being said, McCollum said she experiences an added level of passion and controlled anger when
prosecuting arson cases.
""It's all-consuming for so many people, and it's devastating on a community,"" she said. ""That can
make someone a better prosecutor if it is personal because it matters to them. What can't happen is that
that emotion takes over or that that emotion drives it.""
Warnings, education and fines
The reality is that most people who violate the county's fire restrictions will see no charges at all, even if
they make the exact same mistake as Miller and Marcus did which, in their case, was using incendiary
ammunition while shooting at a shooting range in Basalt.
Most first-time offenders are let off with a warning and educated on the risk of violating restrictions, van
Beek said. Other times, fines may be imposed of $500 for the first offense, $750 for the second and
$1,000 for subsequent offenses.
Eagle County law enforcement responded to at least 59 reports of campfire-related fire restriction
violations between May 1, 2020, and the present day, said Amber Mulson-Barrett, a public information
officer for the Sheriff's Office. Of these, 36 resulted in a fire being found and extinguished, but only a
""handful"" of citations were issued, she said.
This does not include calls received by other regional agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management
or the U.S. Forest Service or violations of other restrictions such as the ban on recreational shooting,
welding or traffic violations like dragging chains.
Focusing on education rather than being overly punitive is the best way to get more community
members to think critically and altruistically about their responsibility in preventing wildfires, van Beek
said.
The U.S. Forest Service, on the other hand, seems to give out fines a bit more readily. The agency
issued 37 citations and 35 warnings related to fire restrictions last year, spokesperson David Boyd said.
Fines on National Forest System lands are strong and become stronger depending on the stage of fire
restrictions in effect, Boyd said.
A first-time offender is charged $500 when Stage 1 restrictions are in effect and double that during Stage
2 restrictions. Repeat offenders are required to appear before a federal magistrate that can impose fines
of up to $5,000 and/or a sentence of up to six months in jail, he said.
""We do hope that as the frequency and severity of wildfires increases, so too will the public's awareness
of how to minimize the risks of starting a wildfire,"" Boyd said in a written statement Wednesday.
A speeding ticket approach?
Garnett said he agrees that educating the public on the risks of violating fire restrictions is hugely
important but said the disparity in how law enforcement responds depending on the outcome of the
violation does not always make sense.
In short, why should some violators receive no punishment just because they got lucky and didn't cause
a fire?
Garnett argued that law enforcement officials should be given more discretion and should use that
discretion to issue more tickets and fines, which would create a stronger deterrent similar to the
effectiveness of speeding tickets. This approach would be clear and consistent rather than some people
receiving heavy criminal charges while others walk off scot-free.
""My view is if you had law enforcement empowered to impose clear, but low-level consequences like
fines by issuing a ticket, in most of these cases you would accomplish what you really want to, which is
to stop the dangerous behavior,"" he said.
Arson cases aren't the only instances where two people can make the same poor decision but receive
very different penalties based on what the outcome happened to be, McCollum said.
She gave the example of two people who may decide to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
The person who gets pulled over for speeding will receive different charges than the person who crashes
into another car and kills two people, even if they have the same amount of alcohol or drugs in their
system, she said.
The devastation of losing one's home to a wildfire cannot be understated, McCollum said, and, in order to
fulfill her duty of bringing about justice, this devastating outcome must be weighed heavily in prosecuting
people like Marcus and Miller.
The damage done by a wildfire is often used as a determinant in deciding how to charge the people that
allegedly started it, but Garnett said the damage often has more to do with the ""foolishness of the victim.""
As climate change brings more frequent and more severe natural disasters from wildfires to hurricanes,
there simply are places that are no longer suitable for construction, residential or otherwise, he said.
Moving forward, homeowners must also be educated about the risks associated with purchasing homes
far from town in wildfire-prone areas, Garnett said.
""They need to take responsibility for that,"" he said.
Garnett, McCollum and van Beek all seemed to agree that, in the case of the Lake Christine Fire, the
system worked as it should, and justice was served as well as it could have been given the situation.
Marcus and Miller served 60 days in jail, were ordered to pay $100,000 each in restitution and were
required to complete six months of full-time community service related to damage caused by the fire.
While the combined $200,000 in restitution doesn't come close to the more than $30 million it took to
contain the fire, McCollum said that there would have been no point in slapping Marcus and Miller with
obscene fees that they could never pay.
Ultimately, no amount of money will replace the personal belongings and family photos of the three
couples who lost their homes, she said.
""You can't give back someone their home,"" McCollum said. ""You can't give back the picturesque
mountainside that's now scarred, you can't give that back. So what they can give back is their time to the
community.""

Engineering  Sustainability in Denver Each of the six sector.txt,"Engineering & Sustainability in Denver. Each of the six sectors for climate change mitigation efforts have
three or four strategies with up to eight recommended actions per strategy.
During a hybrid online and in-person meeting Monday afternoon with approximately 40 attendees,
Newman explained the CAP process began in March 2020 in collaboration with a local four-person
project management team and a larger oversight committee, including an elected official or key staff
member from each partnering agency.
Despite COVID-19 pandemic complications barring in-person charrettes, the consultants conducted an
initial survey to gather insight on community priorities and hosted various online stakeholder focus
groups.
Scott Cowman, Routt County environmental health director and spokesman for the CAP, said organizers
moved the CAP forward to take advantage of state and federal funds for climate action plans.
""We are well positioned to take advantage of state and federal resources that are anticipated to become
increasingly available in the near future,"" Cowman said. ""There will be proposed financial commitments
on the part of the county and municipalities that will be considered on an annual basis by elected officials
as a part of the budget process.""
Routt County and the municipalities of Steamboat Springs, Hayden, Oak Creek and Yampa are all
partners in the CAP.
Cowman said the impacts of climate change are apparent in Routt County, ranging from diminished
stream flows to high intensity wildfires affecting air quality to the 2-degree average increase in
temperature in Colorado in the past 30 years.
""All have the potential to affect our health, economy and way of life,"" Cowman said.
Steamboat Springs City Council and the Routt County Board of Commissioners will discuss the CAP's
final draft during a joint workshop at 5 p.m. May 18 with both online Zoom and limited in-person
attendance available. The final plan will be released in June. Then the CAP will need to be approved this
summer by the commissioners and the municipal councils, according to Winnie DelliQuadri, CAP lead
for the city of Steamboat Springs. Other partners assisting with the CAP include Steamboat Springs
Chamber and Steamboat Ski & Resort Corp.
A significant portion of the greenhouse gas emission reductions modeled through 2050 in the CAP come
from the energy sector, with key contributions via the clean energy transition goals of Xcel Energy, which
sells power to Yampa Valley Electric Association. Statewide goals for a majority switch to electric
vehicles by 2050 also play a strong role. But strides would need to be made in a variety of other action
areas, which are rated in the CAP by priority and complexity.
In the energy sector, some high priority actions include adopting a strategic action plan to improve the
energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings and industrial processes in the community;
reducing barriers to deployment of renewable energy through review and modification of codes and
policies; and developing or supporting renewable energy projects that benefit the whole community, such
as community solar arrays.
In the accountability sector, some high priorities include identifying and developing funding sources for
climate action work; developing a collaborative program to share resources and jointly fund projects; and
updating the greenhouse gas inventory every five years.
For the land use sector, high priorities include protecting and enhancing wetlands and riparian corridors;
creating a public-private partnership to expand forest treatments and reintroducing healthy fire into the
landscape; protecting natural resources that promote carbon mitigation; and enhancing policies,
guidelines and incentives for Smart Growth and compact development.
In the economics sector, high priority examples include expanding green and energy-certified building
stock and transitioning to clean power for government, commercial and residential sectors.
""The CAP provides a menu of strategies, actions and tactics that each entity, as well as other
stakeholders and partners, can select from for their climate action work,"" Cowman said.
The 10-minute community survey can be found at RouttClimateAction.com/get-involved.
Completion of the CAP was funded by $20,000 each from Routt County and the city of Steamboat, as
well as a $25,000 technical assistance grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

Environment Colorado wants solar panels on every new home.txt,"Environment Colorado wants solar panels on every new home
June 25, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Springs, CO)
Author: Joey Bunch Section: Colorado Politics 557 Words
OpenURL Link
Environment Colorado wants every new home equipped with solar panels, and it's in violation of the law.
The organization said this week it's launching a campaign to get there, following California's lead.
Renewable energy advocates are backing similar construction proposals in Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.
Builders in California argued the mandate would add $8,000 to $10,000 in cost per home, worsening the
state's housing affordability crisis, while advocates countered that the higher home prices would be offset
by lower bills for all, including renters, in addition to the environmental benefits.
The Colorado proposal is a continuation of the groundwork laid by Colorado Democrats this year, when
the legislature passed House Bill 1155. The legislation awaiting the governor's signature requires
homebuilders to provide buyers the option of a solar panel or solar thermal system or to prewire or preplumb the home for the systems to be added later.
The bill passed the House on a party-line vote on Feb. 21 and passed the Senate with one Republican
vote, Sen. Kevin Priola of Henderson, who was a co-sponsor.
""In order for Colorado to be a leader on clean, renewable energy, change can and must start at home,""
Hannah Collazo, Environment Colorado's state director, said in a statement. ""Americans have made it
clear that they want solar power, and by creating a direct path for every new home to include this
essential resource, Colorado will make a big contribution toward combating climate change and making
our state healthier and cleaner.""
The group cites momentum in the Colorado legislature, when Democratic majorities in the House and
Senate have embraced Gov. Jared Polis' push to move the the state to 100% renewable energy by
Environment Colorado called mandating solar panels a ""game-changer,"" alleging that doing so
nationwide from 2020 to 2026 would result in more solar energy capacity than the entire U.S. currently
has. Across the country, the move would cutting enough carbon dioxide  a greenhouse gas the fuels
climate change  to equal to 34 million fewer gas-burning vehicles by 2045.
""Solar power is supported by a majority of Coloradans and building all new homes with solar panels is
achievable,"" Collazo stated. ""We cannot miss the opportunity to generate the renewable energy that
comes with powering every new home with solar. The most efficient time to install solar panels is when
workers are already on the roof, and by making homes solar, it will lead to healthier and safer
communities for years to come.""
The California solar mandate is a statewide building code for new single-family and multi-unit
construction that took effect Jan. 1. The California Building Standards Commission approved a mandate
in 2018.
The law allows developers to build community solar projects in lieu of individual rooftop solar panel
systems to power each property approved by the California Clean Energy Commission and the local
utility company.
The mandate encouraged but did not require battery storage, heat pump water heaters and other energystingy technology in newly built homes.
California also banned the use of natural gas in new construction.
To further reduce climate change, at least 13 California cities and one county have banned the
installation of natural gas in new homes.
A proposed ballot initiative for this November would prohibit such bans in Colorado.
Protect Colorado, the group collecting petition signatures, declined to comment on the solar panel
proposal backed by Environment Colorado.

Most Coloradans are concerned about the extreme heat, but even more are worried about the wildfires generated by the changing climate , according to a Morning Consult poll released Thursday by the Environmental Defense Fund.
The poll indicates 86% of respondents are concerned about extreme heat, while 88% cited wildfires.
As for solutions, Morning Consult found:
85% favor more funding for the U.S. Forest Service for wildfire prevention.86% favor removing vegetation at risk of starting wildfires, including dead trees, and selling or recycling the byproducts to help pay for restoration.81% favored expanding energy efficiency programs to reduce the strain on electrical, gas and water systems, as well as generate savings money for consumers.74% favored adopting stronger pollution limits for vehicles and power plants.71% supported implementing policy and technical solutions ""that even the burden among citizens during power outage crisis,"" according to pollsters.67% want candidates running for the U.S. Senate to support aggressive steps to address wildfires.59% want Senate candidates who favor addressing extreme heat.77% said it's important for federal lawmakers to pass legislation to address the underlying causes of droughts.81% said state government should address droughts.79% think local government should adopt drought policies.
As for responsibility to invest in better forest management:
83% named the federal government.90% cited state government88% said local government88% identified private landowners

""It's only a few weeks into the official start of summer and Colorado is already suffering through extreme heat and out-of-control wildfires,"" Dan Grossman, the former Colorado legislator who is the senior director of regulatory and legislative affairs for EDF Action, said in a statement. ""The public is concerned about this extreme weather and wants leaders to take action on climate change, fire prevention, improving air quality and tackling the drought. We have no time to waste, we must act now to protect our environment, safeguard lives and the health of our communities.""
The poll that included interviews and online responses from 300 Colorado adults was conducted between June 17 and June 26 with a margin of error of plus or minus 6%.
The findings reflect 111 people who identify as Democrats, 73 who are Republicans and 116 who are unaffiliated, with a weighted balance of urban, suburban and rural residents.

Estes Valley Land T rust Supports Preserving 30% of Colorado's Lands by 2030
Colorado is known for its scenic beauty, but the loss of nature threatens the quality of life we all share. Since 2001, half-million acres of open space have been lost in Colorado.
T hankfully, there is an international goal to conserve at least 30% of the Earth's lands and waters by 2030. Conserving private lands is a natural solution to help address the climate crises and slow the rate of extinction. To deliver on this deal, the Estes Valley Land T rust is working with other conservation organizations to accelerate the pace and scale of conservation by protecting at least 30 percent of Colorado by 2030.
""Natural climate solutions, such as preserving land, are a proven way to store and reduce carbon emissions,"" said Boring. ""Our local effort to conserve another 5,000 acres in the next 10 years is exactly what communities across the state should be doing to help meet the international goal.""
About the Estes Valley Land T rust  Founded in 1987 by Estes Park residents, the Estes Valley Land T rust is a nationally recognized land conservation organization that has preserved nearly 10,000 acres of land and some of the most iconic landscapes in the Estes Valley. More than 400 members support the Estes Valley Land T rust annually and additional information can be found at evlandtrust.org .

The Estes Valley Fire Protection District would like to recognize community member Mr. Dennis Pettitt,
President of the Lodges at Black Canyon Homeowners' Association, for his exceptional commitment to
improving fire and life-safety in his neighborhood and for those who visit our community.
The Black Canyon Inn complex consisted of multiple buildings which shared a single address number,
and this presented a real challenge for first responders should a timely response be needed. Mr. Pettitt
worked directly with the Estes Valley Fire Prevention Division and the Town of Estes Park Community
Development Department to successfully correct and improve the addressing for this complex and to
meet requirements of the adopted Fire Code. This project included a private street name and sign,
installation of wayfinding signage, and correct unit and building identification.
Coincidentally, Estes Valley Fire crews responded to an incident shortly after this project was completed,
and we were immediately able to find the building and unit in need due to the good work of Mr. Pettitt.
We champion community members like Dennis Pettitt who collaborate in a partnership approach to
improve community safety and to help us achieve our mission of providing the residents and guests to
the Estes Valley with superior fire protection, fire prevention, and emergency services in a safe and

Exhausted firefighters seek fix to low pay.txt,"'Exhausted' firefighters seek fix to low pay

Right now across Colorado, more than a thousand federal firefighters are working to contain blazes
burning through tens of thousands of acres of brush, grass and timber.
None of the Forest Service workers battling these fires are actually considered firefighters  on paper.
Their job titles are forestry or range technicians.
Most of these kinds of firefighters are temporary employees who only work through the summer. Their
starting pay is around $13 an hour, much lower than they'd make at a local, state or private fire
department.
Just as climate change is making fire seasons longer  with more intense blazes  the federal
firefighting force faces staffing shortages and low morale. These problems have lingered for years, but
there is some brewing momentum to increase pay and make other changes to address the shortages.
""It's just a convenient bureaucratic sidestep of just labeling us forestry technicians so that they don't
have to give us the same benefits,"" said Chris Ives, a squad leader for a hotshot crew in the San Juan
National Forest near Durango in southwestern Colorado.
This is Ives' 10th season with the Forest Service. It took him six years to get a permanent job that
comes with year-round health insurance. Despite not carrying the label and pay of a firefighter, Ives
estimates he spends 80% of his time fighting fires or on duties directly related to firefighting.
President Joe Biden has called federal firefighter pay ""ridiculously low"" and pledged to increase it. But
some say it would still be too low.
At a video meeting with governors on June 30, he said the U.S. is late to the game and must act fast.
""We're remembering the horrific scenes from last year,"" he said. ""Orange skies that looked like end of
days. Smoke and ash that made the air dangerous to breathe. More than 10 million acres burned.
Billions of dollars in economic damage.""
The Biden administration announced it will use bonuses and incentives to boost firefighter pay to at least
$15 an hour. Administration officials say they will also allow seasonal employees to work longer and train
and equip more federal workers and military personnel to allow for surge capacity when needed.
Biden also pledged to work with lawmakers to create a permanent federal firefighting force.
Some firefighters say $15 an hour is still too low. Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group
representing federal firefighters, said the moves were a good first step but they want lawmakers to make
long-term fixes.
CPR News spoke to a half-dozen U.S. Forest Service employees like Ives who have helped fight some
of the country's largest, most dangerous fires.
They say low pay and other labor issues have led to the staffing shortages in Colorado and other wildfireprone states like California, Oregon and Washington. A search on USA Jobs, the federal government's
primary job site, regularly shows about 150 openings for forestry and range technicians across the
country.
The shortage means firefighters are exhausted, and their mental health is suffering.
Ives said the gaps have to be filled by existing forestry workers who are feeling exhausted and
overwhelmed. The extra strain takes a toll on their mental health and personal lives.
""Not being able to take time off unless it's a funeral or a wedding and just having that every year just gets
a little more and more tiring and taxing on your psyche,"" he said.
Many local and state fire departments have mental health programs designed to address stressors
specific to a career in firefighting. The Forest Service doesn't, said Ben Elkind, a smokejumper stationed
in Oregon.
""You have real trauma and they're not addressing that in any meaningful way,"" he said.
Forest Service officials declined an interview request. In a written statement, a spokesperson said the
service maintains a ""robust and highly capable workforce,"" but acknowledged that uncompetitive federal
wages have led to high turnover and low recruitment.
Firefighters say the low pay is worsened by high housing costs in fire-prone areas where they're often
stationed.
That includes tourist spots and resort towns near national forests with million-dollar homes.
""I'd say maybe a quarter of our crew are living out of the backs of their trucks or camping out,"" Ives said.
Ben McClane, who leads a wildfire crew based in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwest
Washington, said firefighters who aren't camping or living out of their vehicles often find housing in other
residents' basements.
""It's almost like you're hoping for charity from the local community,"" McClane said.
All of the firefighters CPR News spoke to said similar things. Most had spent time living in their cars or
trucks. One woman working for the U.S. Forest Service in southwestern Colorado, who didn't want to
use her name out of fear it would upsether supervisors, said she lives in an insulated shed because it's
the only shelter she can afford.
Stephen Pyne, a former wildland firefighter who teaches courses on fire and fire history at Arizona State
University, said the Forest Service has long struggled with staffing for what used to be a seasonal-only
occupation.
""They didn't want to hire people full-time and they only wanted them when they needed them,"" he said.
These days, the U.S. wildfireseason is nearly year-long. Pyne said it's like the federal government is
fighting 2021 fires with a 1951 staffing mindset.
He says the Forest Service and other federal land agencies face many of the same labor challenges in
other sectors.
""It's the gig economy,' he said. ""You've got people who are working for relatively low wages, seasonal,
very little career advancement for many of them. That sounds like a lot of unhappy workers in today's
economy.""
Many people whose lives and property are at risk count on federal firefighters.
David Schulman has lived in the forested area near Vail and Eagle, Colorado, for 20 years. On a recent
weekday, he and a friend fixed a gate in the front of his ranch. It was one of the last houses accessible
before emergency vehicles blocked the road, because in the forest near his ranch, the Sylvan fire was
burning.
Schulman's experience could be a sign of the increased need for firefighters during an era of climate
change.
""None of this is new for me,"" he said,"" but having your house under imminent threat to where you could
see the flames? That's something I can do without.""
Most of the firefighters battling the blazes in the national forest behind Shulman's ranch would make
more money if they took an entry-level job with the local fire department in Eagle, population 6,500.
If the federal workers left for the fire department in Denver, most would more than double their pay.

Exhibit in Grand Lake tells tales from Troublesome wildfire.txt,"Exhibit in Grand Lake tells tales from Troublesome wildfire

The East Troublesome Fire that sparked the evacuation of the entire town of Estes Park in October 2020
ravaged areas west of the Continental Divide near Grand Lake. As a nod to the devastation to nature and
people, Grand Lake is hosting a new exhibit called ""Troublesome Stories.""
Filled with stunning photographs, stories of local residents and charred artifacts from the burn, the exhibit
serves as an elevated and respectful documentation of the second largest wildfire in recorded Colorado
history.
""It was the scariest thing I've ever seen,"" said Emily Hagen, executive director of the Grand Lake
Chamber whose seed of an idea turned into the exhibit.
""Immediately after the fire I knew that we would be experiencing a lot of guests this summer once we
figured out we still had a town. I knew that people would want to support us. That's just how people who
visit Grand Lake are,"" she said. ""I started thinking about how we could educate guests about the impact
of the fire  not necessarily the impact to our forest  but the impact on our people.""
The exhibit starts with a map that shows the progression of the fire which started on October 14, 2020.
""It traveled 40 miles in seven days,"" explained Chamber bookkeeper and volunteer Judy Tumblin.
As Tumblin pointed out where the fire jumped the Continental Divide, she explained it was a mile-and-ahalf at 13,200 feet. ""The fact that it could jump over tundra and rock like that is just not comprehensible.
In places, the fire got so hot, that if you touched a granite boulder, it just fell apart. In some places, the fire
hit 3,000 degrees. Some winds were at 120 miles per hour, equivalent to a category 5 hurricane.""
Between the cases with charred artifacts are stories of people impacted by the East Troublesome Fire.
Those stories have names like ""The fire didn't burn my memories"" and ""All that is left.""
The exhibit is surrounded by extraordinary photographs of the fire itself, which are printed on metal.
Grand Lake lost 580 structures and 36 homes, 200 of which were primary residences.
""When you take a town that has 442 people in the winter and you lose a lot of homes, it's been
catastrophic for us,"" Tumblin said.
Hagen said she has 70 friends who lost their single-family residences in the East Troublesome Fire.
""It is really important to me that guests know that our community is still going through this hardship,""
Hagen stressed. ""This is new for us still. This is a recurring reality. We want guests to be here because
they are a massive part of our recovery from this. This exhibit is one of our ways to lay a foundation of
empathy so that they know we're all still a bit raw.""
Larry and Cheryl Pickett of Morrison near Denver recently toured ""Troublesome Stories.""
""We have visited Grand Lake often,"" Cheryl Pickett said. ""It was very scary as we saw it unfold on
television. It was devastating to watch. I think the exhibit is very touching. It kind of brings it more to life.""
Larry Pickett added, ""It's unbelievable.""
Photographer Thomas Cooper
Littleton, Colo., resident Thomas Cooper is the talented photographer whose work defines the
""Troublesome Stories"" exhibit. His company is Lightbox Images.
""I've been covering wildfires in Colorado since the early 2000s,"" Cooper said.  went through a basic
wildland fire training course to learn about the ins and outs of wildfiresafety and firefighting.""
He noted he has covered about 100 wildfires in the last two decades.
""I was heading toward the Cameron Peak Fire from the CalWood Fire when East Troublesome cropped
up,"" Cooper explained. ""Because of the way the fire was moving rapidly, I headed to it because I knew
this was becoming something out of the ordinary. I threw on my fire gear and prepared myself for what
might happen. Then I started shooting pictures.
Cooper captured 9,000 images.
""It was surreal,"" Cooper recalled. ""It was kind of an eerie thing having the landscape completely dark at
noon. Day becomes night. You get disoriented because you don't know which way the sun is going. To
see 30 foot flames and 100 foot trees on fire was incredible. The radiantheat that came from the East
Troublesome Fire is indescribable.""
Over the years, Cooper has had many photographs published in articles and magazines. He has never
been involved in an exhibit like ""Troublesome Stories.""
When he was approached by Grand Lake, Cooper agreed to the project.
""It's definitely something different and I'm happy they reached out to me,"" he mentioned. ""Some people
couldn't enter because it was so intense. To see locals come through the gallery is very moving. I saw
people break down and cry or stare in awe at the images.""
Cooper is hopeful the exhibit will get to travel so that other Coloradans can see it.
""I hope it can bring some attention to fire safety,"" Cooper stressed. ""We need to inform and educate
people that this is real. I was very happy with how everything turned out. The metal gives a real HD

High temperatures and an early snowmelt are causing growing drought worries in Colorado and have firefighters bracing for an unpredictable summer already complicated by the coronavirus.
At least 76% of Colorado now is experiencing drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, with 11% of the state, mostly in southeast and south-central regions, under extreme drought conditions that bring increased wildfire risk and low reservoir levels. This time last year, just 15.7% of the state was abnormally dry.
""If you look at what the drought looks like, especially along the Front Range, we are doing OK today, but that quickly changes,"" said Don Lombardi, fire chief for the West Metro Fire Protection District. ""If you look at the bulk of Colorado, it's anywhere from dry to extreme in terms of fire risk.""
April is typically one of Colorado's wettest months, but much of western and southern Colorado experienced one of the driest Aprils on record. With little precipitation last month, and abnormally high temperatures statewide, Colorado's snowpack is melting faster than usual.
""So some of the state is still doing pretty well,"" said Peter Bennett Goble, climatologist for the Colorado Climate Center at Colorado State University. ""But the farmer's perspective is going to be key with this drought because one of the things that makes this one interesting is that, at least for northern Colorado, we had near normal snowpack.""
Bennett Goble said that most of the winter and spring storms didn't reach the plains, which has contributed to the extreme drought in southeast Colorado. Instead, these areas experienced a lot of windy, dry conditions. Summit County, which supplies most of the water for the metro Denver region, saw an average snowpack this year, he said.
Though every season is different, Bennett Goble is concerned that Colorado is experiencing a trend of increased temperatures without increases in precipitation. As temperatures rise, plants use up their stored water faster  a process called evapotranspiration. Less precipitation coupled with plants using more water creates a challenging situation for farmers already pressured by Colorado's arid climate .

""So we typically see soil moisture build up in the winter and spring months and then in the summer it goes down as the plants use that water, which is being occasionally replenished by thunderstorms,"" Bennett Goble said. ""But during warmer conditions, they use that moisture more quickly, meaning that they're reliant on more precipitation to stay in balance.""
The higher temperatures have also caused Colorado's snowpack, which acts as nature's reservoir, to melt quicker. ""We're past 50% of the snow being melted off in the Southern Rockies and I believe not quite there in the Northern Rockies, but the melt is well underway,"" Bennett Goble said.
MORE: As forests burn in Colorado and around the world, drinking water is at risk
Early snowmelt usually means drier conditions in the summer, which increases the risk for wildfire, he said. ""And I would say that the next four to five or six weeks or so are critical because if we stay dry during that period it becomes really hard to undo the damage.""
The CWCB and Division of Water Resources meet monthly with climate and water experts to plan for extreme drought, mitigate water supply concerns, and monitor related hazards such as wildfire, Holcomb said.
Some fire districts feel more prepared than others for the drought conditions.
""Fortunately for our fire district, we're at a little lower elevation. And the majority of our fire protection district encompasses irrigated agricultural land and the city,"" Montrose Fire Rescue Chief T ad Rowan said. ""So we don't have a whole lot of wildland-urban interface.""
Montrose County is currently experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions. Rowan's department works closely with the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to manage wildfires in surrounding areas.
MORE: Climate change is transforming Western forests. And that could have big consequences far beyond wildfires.
He said the biggest challenge for this wildfireseason will be navigating the coronavirus. T ypically, firefighters gather in large groups in fire camps when working to manage a wildfire, which will increase the risk of exposure or spread of the coronavirus throughout the firefighting corps.
""So there's a lot of planning and effort going into that, not only at the local level but at the state and federal level as well,"" Rowan said.
That's also a big concern for Lombardi.
""We're gonna always think it's the worst and prepare for that. And now with COVID-19 happening, it's changed things around for us dramatically, at least from a response perspective,"" Lombardi said.
Lombardi said some of his staff have the coronavirus, and that the ones who don't are coming in contact with individuals who have the virus on a daily basis because they are responding to calls. ""So far, we've done really well with having not very many folks get COVID-19.""
Buthe said he's worried about the increased risk for his first responders as the state opens up and Coloradans resume activities such as camping and hiking.
""They talk about the second wave in the fall and, well, I'm concerned that it may be sooner than that,"" Lombardi said. ""But again, I'm not an epidemiologist. I'm not a doctor. I'm just telling you what my gut tells me.""
""We think our call volume is going to go up and in turn, that community risk or that community spread could be greater,"" he said. ""So I'm concerned that we won't have enough healthy firefighters to be able to respond, and I think all the fellow fire chiefs that I talked to are in that same boat.""
In mid-April, fire chiefs across the state sent a letter to Gov. Jared Polis asking him to issue a statewide fire ban to reduce the risk of wildfire and unnecessary coronavirus exposure for firefighters. Though he did not issue a statewide fire ban, the governor did give counties expanded authority to ban fires in their districts, regardless of wildfire risk.
""We recognize that if any of our first responders were to become sick, our efforts to respond to fires and other emergencies would be significantly hampered which is why we are in constant contact with emergency management professionals to determine whether additional action is necessary,"" Polis' spokesman Conor Cahill said in an email.
Lombardi said his firefighters often are deployed throughout the state to assist other districts with fires and emergencies. He said the coronavirus will make lending his staff out more challenging.
""I'm not saying that we won't, but it's going to be very difficult and it might not be the amount of people we might typically send and it might not be the timeliness that we've done before,"" said Lombardi, whose team is made up of close to 400 firefighters. ""I have to think twice about that, to make sure that I have enough folks here to respond to what happens here in my community.""
He said the general public needs to understand that it won't be business as usual when the state fully opens up. And that the response from firefighters is not going to be as quick as usual if fires occur in multiple places because firefighters are also responding to coronavirus-related calls.
""It could be catastrophic, depending on how dry it gets and how hot it gets,"" Lombardi said. ""And people just have to know that our response is going to be impacted because of the COVID virus. We probably won't be able to send as many people as we had before.""

Faith-based activists, 'rebel' group ring climate change alarm in
Boulder

When the clock struck 11 a.m. Saturday, close to 100 climate activists solemnly rang bells and banged
on gongs and drums in front of the Boulder County Courthouse.
As the sounds resonated across Pearl Street Mall, red-robbed protesters donned clock masks and
letters that spelled out the words: out of time. Others joining in the movement carried signs picturing the
planet.
The display, which brought pause to some curious shoppers, who stopped to snap pictures on their
cellphones, was a collaboration between 11th Hour Calling, a group of interfaith activists and Extinction
Rebellion, a nonviolent rebellion team protesting government inaction on the climate crisis. While they
demanded action from county and world leaders, their message also sought to show that saving the
planet is everybody's problem.
Mary Beth Downing, a co-founder of the 11th Hour Calling , said if people don't associate the faith
community with climate activism, they should. Downing, a Christian, quoted Genesis 2:15 in the Bible,
which talks about God placing man in the garden to serve and protect it.
""We need to do that,"" Downing said. ""Every faith organization has a wing of creation care. We need to
push (other faith organizations) to be louder because the timing is urgent. Climate issues are foundational
for social justice and economic justice. It resonates spiritually and morally.""
Michael Denslow, with Extinction Rebellion , spoke into a megaphone Saturday reiterating the group's
four demands, which include advocating for the government to be truthful about the climate crisis and
create policies to reduce carbon emissions by 2025.
In 2016, Boulder created a climate commitment, outlining goals such as reaching 100% renewable
energy by 2030 and reducing 80% of city organization emissions by 2030, to name a few. Though worthy
initiatives, Downing said Saturday's message was also about encouraging individual action.
""To really make the change we need, it has to be a personal change,"" Downing said. ""It has to be a
community change and a national and global change.""
Dressed in red and holding a clock face mask, Margot Iseman , of Boulder, stood on the corner of 14th
and Spruce streets, as protesters prepared to march to Pearl Street. When asked why she was there,
she said, ""It's obvious.""
""(The message) is for people to do what they can personally and legislatively to mitigate the issue,""
Iseman said.
Lisa Verdon, of Boulder , sat in front of protesters with a sign that read: ""Many paths one planet.""
""(I'm outhere) because of the impact of the looming climate crisis, especially with what's going on in
Australia,"" Verdon said.
Wildfires in Australia have decimated large swaths of land, leaving people and animals without a place to
call home. Brett Melbourne, an ecology associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder,
termed the infernos an ecological disaster.
Wearing flowing scarlet gowns, a crown of red flowers and carrying pine boughs, the Red Rebel Brigade,
a performance art element of Extinction Rebellion, also marched with protesters. The brigade, in its
vibrant costumes, has been seen across the globe protesting climate change.
As the ringing bells ceased shortly after 11:15 a.m. Downing called on protesters to continue to spread
the message.To make their own strides in protecting the climate, Downing encouraged people to visit
online resources, like 52climateactions.com, that can provide tips about living more sustainability.
While the participants struck a somber chord Saturday, Downing said the toll of the bell, and fighting for
their planet, could also be joyous.
""We always leave empowered,"" she said.

ST EAMBOAT SPRINGS -- A large wildfire erupted in a remote area south of Hayden in what appears to be the first major blaze of the year in Routt County.
Multiple firefighting agencies responded to the fire near the Indian Run area. It had grown to about 375 acres as of 5:45 p.m., according to firefighters on scene. Plumes of smoke were visible from Hayden.
At 4:05 p.m., Routt County Emergency Management sent a message alerting residents in the Williams Fork and Motherwell Ranch area to be prepared to evacuate due to the fire .
High winds fed the flames, with gusts reaching 30 mph, according to Routt County Emergency Operations Director David ""Mo"" DeMorat. The burn site consists of brush and some trees.
As of Thursday evening, officials believed the fire to be human caused.
Fighting fires and a pandemic
This comes after three smaller fires broke out in different areas of the county Wednesday, putting officials on high alert as they try to manage already stressed resources amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Wednesday wildfires started from what were supposed to be controlled burns. The first fire of the day, an out-of-control agricultural burn, was called in just after 11 a.m. along Routt County Road 8 west of Yampa. Then around noon, another agricultural burn near Hayden grew beyond the farmer's control.
In both cases, firefighters quickly were able to extinguish the flames without damage to any structures, according to fire chiefs in those areas.
At 2:40 p.m., firefighters received the third report of a wildfire on a ranch along C.R. 24 near the Haymaker Golf Course. That blaze, which grew to about 2 acres, was the result of an illegal burn pile, according to Steamboat Springs Fire Rescue Interim Fire Chief Chuck Cerasoli. Burn piles are not allowed after April 15, he said.
The farmer responsible received a citation and a court summons for the illegal burn, Cerasoli said.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cerasoli said it is more important than ever for people to obey fire restrictions and to be careful when conducting legal burns. Extinguishing even smaller fires requires a large crew, he said, which takes resources away from potential medical emergencies.
""With this pandemic going on, anything that takes our entire staff away to be working on something else limits their availability to emergency response and ambulance response,"" Cerasoli
said.
It is difficult for firefighters to practice health guidelines while they are battling blazes, he added, which poses concerns over disease transmission.
""It puts our entire staff at risk,"" Cerasoli said.
Fires also could harm the general public's health. Studies have shown a link between poor air quality, which includes pollutants from smoke, and worsened symptoms for COVID-19 patients.
Though it is early in the fire season, much of the vegetation in the area, such as sagebrush and oak brush, is still in its dormant stage, meaning it is very dry, according to Oak Creek Fire Chief Chuck Wisecup. The dry vegetation can cause fires to spread quickly, even if the ground is moist.
Before starting a fire, you should understand:
* Firefighting resources may not be able to respond to your aid, and you may be solely responsible for extinguishing the fire and any associated liability.
* Out-of-control fires may result in criminal charges if the fire moves onto private property of others.
* You can be civilly and criminally responsible for out of control fires due to negligence or unsafe burning practices.
DO NOT :
* Intentionally start an open burn without a signed permit. Violators will be issued a citation with fines ranging from $500 up to $1,500 for violations under state statute C.R.S 25-7-123.
* Start an agriculture burn or controlled burn without first calling Routt County Communications and advising that you are conducting a burn. Please provide the time and location prior to starting the burn.
* Start any type of burn unless conditions are safe and personal resources are readily available to attack fires that may become out of control, even if you have a permit. Know your limitations.
* Violate any current fire restriction in place. If you have a question, call your fire district.

To reduce the number of fires during the pandemic, the U.S. Forest Service has banned all recreational fires on Forest Service land in the Rocky Mountain region, which includes the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests. The restrictions apply to campfires, charcoal grills and barbecues, coal and wood-burning stoves and sheepherders' stoves, according to a news release from the Forest Service.
In a separate news release, the Routt County Sheriff's Office said it is considering tightening fire restrictions across the county. For now, agricultural burns and other controlled burns are allowed with proper permits. To obtain a permit, call the local fire district or visit co.routt.co.us/164/openburning .
People who violate these rules could get a fine ranging from $500 to $1,500 under Colorado revised statutes, according to the Sheriff's Office.
If calls for fires continue to raise concerns, officials said they would tighten restrictions even further.
""We ask the community to consider how stressed local county and municipal government resources are at this time due to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Sheriff Garrett Wiggins, who also acts as the county's fire warden, said in the release.
Wildfire mitigation
During an average year, about 4,500 wildfires are reported across the state, burning around 168,000 acres, according to data from the Colorado State Forest Service. Fire seasons have grown more intense and damaging in the last decade for a number of reasons, from drought to past forest management.
In response to the worsening effects of fires, local agencies have prioritized mitigation efforts to prevent large blazes that can cost millions of dollars to extinguish. Last year marked the first Routt County Mitigation Conference that aimed to help to educate residents on how to prepare their homes for fire season.
On Thursday, Gov. Jared Polis designated May as Wildfire Awareness Month. It presents an opportunity for residents to reduce the risk of fires around their houses. T aking simple steps, such as removing dry, dead debris from around structures and devising an evacuation plan among family members, could save homes and lives.
Wildfire mitigation tips
* Rake and remove pine needles and dry leaves 5 feet from the home, as well as under decks, porches, sheds and play structures.
* Remove leaves and needles from roofs and gutters.
* Sweep porches and decks clear of any burnable plant material.
* Move firewood piles at least 30 feet from the house, preferably uphill.
* T ransfer items under decks or porches to a storage area.
* Cover any exposed eave or attic vents with 1/8-inch metal mesh screening.
* Ensure home address signs are clearly visible from the street.
* Confirm at least one alternate path out of your neighborhood other than the one most commonly used and be prepared for potential evacuation requiring the alternative route.
* Sign up for Routt County Alerts

Residents also can sign up for Routt County Alerts, which sends out notifications of any emergencies in the area. To sign up, follow the link on the county's website: co.routt.co.us/144/communications.

On June 8, 2002 the Hayman Fire introduced the state of Colorado to a new era of political concern: wildfireseasons that threaten the life, lifestyle and livelihood of statewide residents.
The Hayman Fire burned through 138,116 acres in southern Colorado and cost the state and federal government an estimated $238 million (paling in comparison to smaller, more recent fires ). The 10 largest wildfires in Colorado history have occurred since the Hayman Fire.
A post-fire study of the Hayman Fire completed by the American Planning Association presented the state of Colorado as lacking political will for creating wildfire regulation. The assessment is right: years of minimal government funding, limited government intervention, and lack of a clear vision for forest care in our legislature is destroying our state. Our legislators have led us into negligence by failing to fund the one office assigned to care for this problem.
The Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control is woefully underfunded -- allocated a miniscule $30 million for the 2021 fiscal year (less that 10% of the Colorado Department of Public Safety budget).
We have a problem that costs hundreds of millions of dollars each year and our state budget allocates tens of millions to create farfetched solutions.
These solutions appear most notably in the Colorado Department of Public Safety's annual performance planning. The FY 2019 Performance Plan notes reducing large wildland fires as a key strategic policy initiative. The 2021 plan replaces the initiative with ""increasing live-fire training for firefighters across Colorado."" The language shift is understandable: it's hard to reduce the occurrence of wildfires when there is no funding to create solutions. The rhetoric also represents something more nefarious: an inability to imagine meaningful prevention strategies.
The underfunded offices and replaced objectives consign the Colorado community to a future filled with smoke.
Simply put: we need better plans and we need more money to implement those plans.
T hroughout Colorado, we are spending the first two weeks of September praying for a freak snowstorm to make up for a legislature incapable of securing funding for meaningful wildfire mitig ation.

ST EAMBOAT SPRINGS -- September marks Mathew Ridge's fourth month living in Routt County -- a month he will not soon forget.
The Clark Store where he works as a manager is just 5 miles from the Middle Fork Fire, which has been burning north of Steamboat Springs since Sept. 6. It has grown to 6,760 acres in size, according to the latest update from the U.S. Forest Service.
On Friday morning, four white trucks with Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management badges on the doors were parked outside the Clark Store in North Routt. About 15 firefighters typically come in each day to grab a breakfast burrito, a soda or some snacks for their long days on the job. It's good for business, Ridge said.
A few hundred feet down the road, at the North Routt Fire Protection District, more trucks with government insignias filled the parking lot and lined the side roads. Routt County's mobile emergency operations center was stationed outside the fire department with a large map of the blaze taped to the outside. Two men looked at it, gesturing and discussing wind direction.
The scene was reminiscent of a battlefield headquarters, and in many ways there is a war going on. Firefighting crews, vehicles and aircraft have been deployed from across the country to try to stop the inferno from spreading.
For now, it is restricted to the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area, a remote zone that makes it too dangerous for on-the-ground personnel to fight it directly. Instead, ground crews have been clearing trails and preparing to protect any structures that could fall within the fire 's path. With no moisture in the forecast for the next week, Mother Nature does not have much firefighting power of its own.
Though Ridge is no fire expert and is new to the valley, even he recognizes how unusually dry this summer has been.
""It's like a big tinderbox out there,"" he said.
The new abnormal
A front-page article in the New York T imes on Wednesday served as a sobering summary of just how disastrous the effects of climate change have become. Colorado, California, Oregon and Washington have lost entire towns to historic wildfires, sending smoke all the way to the East Coast.
What is worse, according to the scientists quoted in the T imes article, the consequences of climate change, from rising sea levels and more extreme natural disasters, are now locked into the global ecosystem and cannot be reversed.
The Middle Fork Fire is burning in an area with a lot of dead and downed timber, primarily from beetle kill and the 1997 Routt Divide Blowdown that toppled millions of trees. After a record-arid summer, those trees have record-low moisture content, according to Maribeth Pecotte, a spokesperson for the Forest Service. She called such dry timber ""1,000-hour fuels,"" referring to the fuel moisture index, a way to understand fire potential.
T housand-hour fuels do not burn as easily, but once they do start burning they generate extreme heat and often cause the most dangerous fire conditions. They also are harder to extinguish, largely uninhibited by cooler temperatures or bouts of rain.
That is part of the reason why the Middle Fork Fire continues to rage, even this late in the year when wildfires typically dwindle, Pecotte said.
This is indicative of a wider trend in fire behavior. As Jesse McCarty, another spokesperson and former firefighter with the Forest Service explained, wildfires historically were frequent but smaller and less intense. A combination of poor fire management over the last century and the effects of climate change have created a new, disturbing reality. Fires are getting more intense, burning hotter and lasting longer, McCarty said.
Forecasts to evaluate fire risk are becoming increasingly unreliable as the abnormal becomes the new normal, making it harder for scientists and government agencies to know what to expect.
""We used to have a fire season. Now there is talk of fire years,"" McCarty explained. ""That's unheard of.""
Faces fighting the flames
As wildfires worsen, agencies like the Forest Service and local fire departments have spent more money and resources to fight them. There currently are four helicopters and a fixed-wing airplane dedicated to the Middle Fork Fire .
Heli-base manager Eric Panebaker took this reporter on a personal tour of the aircraft on Thursday at the Steamboat Springs Airport where the air was intermittently pungent with the stench of gasoline.
One of the helicopters, known as a sky crane, originally was designed for the Navy. It has twin engines below the rotor, packing 4,600 of horsepower each. They look like cannons. This type of helicopter was designed for one thing, Panebaker said, lifting heavy things.
When fighting fires, its primary luggage is water. The sky crane is capable of lugging 2,400 gallons, but at Routt County's higher elevation, it usually carries up to 1,500 gallons. Attached to the storage tank is a long snorkel that resembles an elephant's trunk but four times as wide.
The snorkel is capable of sucking water fast enough to fill the tank in just a minute, Panebaker said. Really any body of water will do for a fill-up as long as it is at least 3 feet deep. Some helicopter pilots have even used people's backyard pools. Around here, pilots usually opt for a mountain lake
or a river.
The other large helicopter in use for the Middle Fork Fire, a Chinook, uses a 2,500-gallon bucket attached to a cable to drop water on the flames. Getting a precise drop while also manning the flight controls and accounting for the pendulum swing of the bucket makes one of those claw games at arcades look like a stroll on the beach.
The pilot of the chopper, Ryan O'Herron, compared the process to chess, a mental game that requires always being a step ahead.
""Plus a lot of practice,"" he added.
'If drones fly, we can't'
A quick but important note to the public: do not fly drones near a wildfire. A temporary flight restriction is in effect around the Middle Fork Fire making it illegal to do so.
There have been at least 15 incidents across the country this year in which a drone endangered or delayed firefighting efforts, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. If one is detected in the area, it forces firefighting crews to ground their air operations, costing valuable time and resources. Even small drones can cause a fatal crash if it hits an aircraft.
""If we spot one, we're done. We can't risk the lives of a flight crew,"" O'Herron said.
Smoke on the horizon
Friday morning was refreshingly clear in North Routt after weeks of intermittentheavy smoke. The Middle Fork Fire has calmed considerably over the last few days, according to McCarty, the Forest Service spokesperson.
But by the afternoon, gusting winds fanned the flames, sending plumes of thick smoke rising above the horizon. Ridge, the Clark Store manager, has noticed the smoke most at sunset and sunrise when the sky turns a hazy, apocalyptic orange.
Officials are bracing for warmer, drier conditions and strong winds to sweep through the forest and escalate fire activity over the weekend, according to the latest update from the federal agency. Fires on the West Coast show no sign of disappearing anytime soon.
""A lot of these fires will have folks fighting them until you and I are skiing,"" Panebaker said.
This is a hard truth to swallow for outdoor enthusiasts, ranchers, environmentalists and anyone who feels a fondness for the world as it was.
If nations do not take immediate and significant action to combat climate change, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the consequences will get exponentially worse, scientists warn. Achieving effective solutions is no easy task. Doing so requires reorienting the entire global economy that has become dependent on fossil fuels. In places like Routt and neighboring Moffat
County, it means people will lose high-paying jobs, and communities will have to look for new industries in order to survive.
But when it comes to survival, doing nothing would be much, much worse.

In Colorado Springs, the fire danger in the summer of 2021 is higher than it would be in an average year
even though the community is not currently in a drought, Fire Marshal Brett Lacey said.
The tall green grasses that flourished after a wet spring will likely pose a risk as they go dormant or die
and dry out during the predicted hot and dry summer, he said.
When the grass catches fire they can produce flame lengths, up to triple the height of their own height, he
said.
Above-average temperatures and scant rain could replicate conditions similar to those seen in 2012,
when the Waldo Canyon fire burned more than 18,000 acres, 347 homes and killed two people in
western Colorado Springs.
""The indications are still pretty strong that we will get there,"" Lacey said.
Statewide, three consecutive years largely without monsoons, record-low soil moistures in the fall and
below average winter snowpack have set the stage for the giant smoke plumes rising over Colorado.
""It's sad, sad when anything burns,"" said Bob Nock, owner of Eagle River Anglers, who's been watching
the Sylvan fire blaze through thousands of acres this week about 16 miles south of Eagle in thick partially
beetle-killed forest.

An occasional series of conversations with experts on the science and policies regarding fires.
Last month, Dan Gibbs, whose day job is as executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural
Resources, got up close and personal with the Cameron Peak fire as it raged through more than 200,000
acres of the Arapaho-Roosevelt national forests near Glen Haven.
There were times when he stood a foot away from the flames.
Buthe wasn't there to monitor what the fires would do to watersheds. Gibbs was there as a Type 2
Certified Wildland firefighter, a volunteer job he's held since 2007. He's been on the front lines of the
recent fires, both at Cameron Peak and in August at the Grizzly Creek fire near Glenwood Springs.
What does a firefighter think of, so close to the flames that can turn in a second from the winds?
How to get out.
It's part of the training, Gibbs explained. It's physical labor, all day long, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. many
days. He likened it to doing Crossfit for 16 hours straight. ""You're digging fire lines with tools with names
like Pulaskis, chainsaws and rabbits,"" he said.
One of the main jobs is to clear fuels  that's anything flammable, such as brush and trees  away
from the homes they were trying to save.
If the fire was approaching a house, they would go right up to the fire line and dig trenches and clear
vegetation. Homes with a defensible space have a fighting chance, Gibbs said.
Many of the homes are heated with propane tanks, and they would spray the tanks with foam to prevent
them from exploding. They didn't win them all. Once, when they were spray-foaming a tank, they heard a
large boom. It was the tank at the house next to them.
Cameron Peak was unique, Gibbs said. The winds would gust up to 50 or 60 miles per hour, which not
only would blow someone over, but create uncertainty that can be life-threatening to firefighters.
""We're constantly thinking, how do I get out of here?"" Gibbs said. At one home, fire burned one side of
the property, and while they saved the house, the fire went from the northside to the south, and that's
where the propane tank was. There was just one way out, on the driveway, with fire on both sides of it.
In those situations, there are a lot of ""snags""  trees coming down  and firefighters worry that a snag
would come down on that road and block their only escape route.
""That's the reality of a lot of fire situations,"" Gibbs said.
State and federal call-ups
Gibbs went through the Colorado Wildland Fire and Incident Academy in 2007. Minimum qualifications
include a ""red card,"" a federal credential that allows a firefighter to go on federal lands. Everything has a
credential, even the equipment, he said.
The fires he's fought in 2020 have largely been on federal lands. Gibbs is on both the state and federal
call-up system. When they call, he goes. He's not part of a regular crew, but gets plugged in with teams
when he shows up to a staging area.
It's not a job that you go home from at the end of the day. Firefighters stay on site, often sleeping on the
ground near the areas that they had just extinguished. One night they slept in an area where the fuels
had burned away, Gibbs said. The fire was still all around them but they were in a safe zone. ""At night,
the skies looked like the Fourth of July,"" he said.
He was also the oldest member of the crew he was on at Cameron Peak. ""This is a young person's
sport,"" he said.
On his Facebook page in late October, Gibbs said the week was ""unsettling, exhilarating and emotionally
draining to say the least ... This was perhaps one of my most intense deployments as our team was
directly attacking the fire by digging fire lines, engaging in structure protection and building defensible
space.""
Gibbs added that the ""persistent high winds and intense smoke were some of the worst I have ever
encountered and many of my teammates agreed.
""I can't say enough about my team on the Cameron Peak Fire and all the wildland firefighters who are at
this very moment risking their lives to save homes and our communities. Many I served with had no
health insurance or were from seasoned out hotshot crews. We must explore ways to give these men
and women the resources they need to be as safe and effective as possible and explore making these
positions permanent because fire season is now no longer seasonal.""
Now that the fires are approaching containment  Cameron Peak is now at 92% containment, according
to InciWeb, the federal incident information system  Gibbs has gone back to his day job, which will
involve the aftermath.
Protecting the watershed
Among DNR's first tasks is to protect rivers and other natural resources from the fire impacts.
Fires like Cameron Peak and Grizzly Creek, which ran alongside the Colorado River through Glenwood
Canyon, have huge impacts on water supplies, Gibbs explained. A grant program from DNR's Colorado
Water Conservation Board will deal with watershed restoration and flood mitigation. (A watershed is a
surface area from which runoff from rainfall drains to a common point, ranging in size from streams to
lakes, rivers and oceans. Virtually all lands are technically part of a watershed.) That program is
designed to help affected communities develop planning and engineering strategies to mitigate flood and
debris flow risks post-fire.
Another DNR-managed program: mitigation grants, which help pay to create defensible space around
buildings and infrastructure, including water supplies. Grant funds supported by DNR also provide forest
restoration.
CWCB also has a tool known as FACE, short for ""future avoided cost explorer""  to help educate
counties and local governments on the potential future costs of wildfires, floods, and drought as the
climate changes and Colorado's population grows, to encourage long-term, resilient planning.
Another challenge is breaking down ""silos"" that exist between federal, state, tribal agencies and private
landowners in dealing with the aftermath of wildfires and how to deal with them in the future. Gibbs said
fires don't know the difference between those kinds of landscapes. He believes there is better
collaboration on wildfire issues, due in part to a ""shared stewardship"" memorandum of understanding
between the state and the U.S. Forest Service, signed in October, 2019.
Part of that MOU will involve creating a map inventory. ""We don't know exactly"" what counties are doing
about forest thinning on their open space, or what the feds, state and tribal lands have done, he said. ""No
one has ever coordinated a mapping exercise."" That map will identify the gaps and where the partners
can get the most bang for the buck through collaboration. Restoration and mitigation efforts are
something of a patchwork quilt right now, Gibbs said. The MOU will help everyone figure out what to
collaborate on.
Climate change and management
The other issue for DNR is climate change. Gibbs pointed out that the 20 largest fires in Colorado have
all happened in the last 20 years. Temperatures are climbing, and on average are higher than during the
1930s dust bowl. Then there's drought. The entire state is in drought, and 74% is in D3 and D4 drought,
the worst drought conditions.
Angela Boag, DNR's policy advisor on climate change and forest management, said what's on her mind
is the implications fires have both for wildlife and forests. Fires cause reductions in streamflows in
summer and fall, and that affects wildlife and fish habitats.
That means working with researchers in the division of parks and wildlife to see how wildlife adapt to
climate change.
""Climate change amplifies the problems we already have,"" Boag said. Those problems include 100 years
of suppressing fires, which has led to a ton of fuel ready to burn. Hotter temperatures contribute to more
extreme drought, and then add in the challenges from people moving into the wildland-urban interface, or
recreating in forest areas.
Climate change adds fuel to that perfect storm, Boag explained, making those forests more likely to
burn. ""We have to be more strategic in managing the forest ... We need to know where we're doing
vegetation treatments, forest thinning"" and how to connect those treatments. Prescribed burns is also
another tool, she added. ""We need to remember that fire is a natural part of ecosystems,"" so long as key
values, such as homes and infrastructure, including water supplies, are not at risk.
Gibbs said one of the biggest challenges is that a million Coloradans live in wildland-urban interface
areas. A hundred years ago, you could let the forest in those unpopulated areas burn, but today those
are population centers, he said.
He acknowledged that county commissioners are under tremendous pressure to approve new
developments, and he would know, since he spent eight years as a Summit County commissioner.
But when he's out on the fire lines, trying to protect a home that's next to a wilderness boundary, he's
thinking ""who approved this?""
Gibbs said if he had a magic wand, he'd tie community wildfire protection plans  required for
communities with fire risks  to development codes. That would then require county commissioners to
think about the potential wildfire activity that could happen before they approve a development, and many
counties do that, but not all.
Until that happens, Gibbs urges people who live in that wildland-urban interface to take responsible
actions for their own lands and create defensible spaces.
Gibbs has been working on these issues for years. It isn't only his interest as a wildland firefighter. He
spent three years in the General Assembly, one in the House and two in the Senate, and even then the
fires called him. He missed Opening Day of the 2009 session when he was called up to help fight a fire in
Boulder County. Shortly after, he traveled to Washington, D.C., to advocate for funding to fight the
mountain pine beetle epidemic.
The beetle has been one of Gibbs' constant companions, sometimes literally. He once brought a bark
beetle prop  a small log  to the state Capitol to show the devastation the beetle can create.
Unfortunately, the log got left sitting on a window ledge, and heat warmed it, as well as the beetle larva
inside. They hatched.
That led to a beetle infestation on the southwest wing of the Capitol's third floor and a visit by fumigators.
""It's one way to bring the issue of foresthealth to the Capitol,"" Gibbs quipped.

Firefighters seek fix to low pay lacking benefits.txt,"Firefighters seek fix to low pay, lacking benefits

Right now across Colorado, more than a thousand federal firefighters are working to contain blazes
burning through tens of thousands of acres of brush, grass and timber.
None of the Forest Service workers battling these fires are actually considered firefighters  on paper.
Their job titles are forestry or range technicians.
Most of these kinds of firefighters are temporary employees who only work through the summer. Their
starting pay is around $13 an hour, much lower than they'd make at a local, state or private fire
department.
Just as climate change is making fire seasons longer  with more intense blazes  the federal
firefighting force faces staffing shortages and low morale. These problems have lingered for years, but
there is some brewing momentum to increase pay and make other changes to address the shortages.
""It's just a convenient bureaucratic sidestep of just labeling us forestry technicians so that they don't
have to give us the same benefits,"" said Chris Ives, a squad leader for a hotshot crew in the San Juan
National Forest near Durango in southwestern Colorado.
This is Ives' 10th season with the Forest Service. It took him six years to get a permanent job that
comes with year-round health insurance. Despite not carrying the label and pay of a firefighter, Ives
estimates he spends 80% of his time fighting fires or on duties directly related to firefighting.
President Joe Biden has called federal firefighter pay ""ridiculously low"" and pledged to increase it. But
some say it would still be too low.
At a video meeting with governors on June 30, he said the U.S. is late to the game and must act fast.
The Biden administration announced it will use bonuses and incentives to boost firefighter pay to at least
$15 an hour. Administration officials say they will also allow seasonal employees to work longer and train
and equip more federal workers and military personnel to allow for surge capacity when needed.
Biden also pledged to work with lawmakers to create a permanent federal firefighting force.
Some firefighters say $15 an hour is still too low. Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group
representing federal firefighters, said the moves were a good first step but they want lawmakers to make
long-term fixes.
CPR News spoke to a half-dozen U.S. Forest Service employees like Ives who have helped fight some
of the country's largest, most dangerous fires.
They say low pay and other labor issues have led to the staffing shortages in Colorado and other wildfireprone states like California, Oregon and Washington. A search on USA Jobs, the federal government's
primary job site, regularly shows about 150 openings for forestry and range technicians across the
country.
The shortage means firefighters are exhausted, and their mental health is suffering.
Ives said the gaps have to be filled by existing forestry workers who are feeling exhausted and
overwhelmed. The extra strain takes a toll on their mental health and personal lives.
""Not being able to take time off unless it's a funeral or a wedding and just having that every year just gets
a little more and more tiring and taxing on your psyche,"" he said.
Many local and state fire departments have mental health programs designed to address stressors
specific to a career in firefighting. The Forest Service doesn't, said Ben Elkind, a smokejumper stationed
in Oregon.
""You have real trauma and they're not addressing that in any meaningful way,"" he said.
Forest Service officials declined an interview request. In a written statement, a spokesperson said the
service maintains a ""robust and highly capable workforce,"" but acknowledged that uncompetitive federal
wages have led to high turnover and low recruitment.
Firefighters say the low pay is worsened by high housing costs in fire-prone areas where they're often
stationed.
""I'd say maybe a quarter of our crew are living out of the backs of their trucks or camping out,"" Ives said.
Ben McClane, who leads a wildfire crew based in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in southwest
Washington, said firefighters who aren't camping or living out of their vehicles often find housing in other
residents' basements.
""It's almost like you're hoping for charity from the local community,"" McClane said.
All of the firefighters CPR News spoke to said similar things. Most had spent time living in their cars or
trucks. One woman working for the U.S. Forest Service in southwestern Colorado, who didn't want to
use her name out of fear it would upsether supervisors, said she lives in an insulated shed because it's
the only shelter she can afford.
Stephen Pyne, a former wildland firefighter who teaches courses on fire and fire history at Arizona State
University, said the Forest Service has long struggled with staffing for what used to be a seasonal-only
occupation.
""They didn't want to hire people full-time and they only wanted them when they needed them,"" he said.
These days, the U.S. wildfireseason is nearly year-long. Pyne said it's like the federal government is
fighting 2021 fires with a 1951 staffing mindset.
He says the Forest Service and other federal land agencies face many of the same labor challenges in
other sectors.
""It's the gig economy,' he said. ""You've got people who are working for relatively low wages, seasonal,
very little career advancement for many of them. That sounds like a lot of unhappy workers in today's
economy.""

ST EAMBOAT SPRINGS  Firefighters have begun containing the Middle Fork Fire around the southwest border, and it is now 1% contained, as of Sunday. The fire is now 19,938 acres.
Strong winds from the weekend, which are expected to continue Sunday, have weakened trees and caused torching and flanking in the fire, making containment more challenging for firefighters.
Firefighters will continue to build containment lines and extinguish hot spots along the fire perimeter ""where safe to insert crews,"" a report from the U.S. Forest Service states.
Helicopters will get crews to parts of the fire inaccessible by foot, the report says.
There are no evacuation or pre-evacuation orders in effect for Routt County. Pre-evacuations are in place in Jackson County for Rainbow Lakes, Aqua Fria, as well as T eal and T iago Lakes areas. This is not intended for the Rainbow Lakes Community. That notification from Jackson County was primarily made for hunters and ranchers with cattle in those areas. Not all management action points stimulate evacuations; however, if the fire were to reach any pre-identified management action points that are evacuation related, it would trigger Routt and Jackson counties.

Update at 4:25 p.m.: Firefighters have successfully doused the flames, but fuels continue to smolder in the area, according to Summit Fire & EMS spokesperson Steve Lipsher.
""We have crews on scene to keep it from spreading further,"" Lipsher said. ""We expect to get a handle on this thing.""
Lipsher said about 25 firefighters responded to the blaze in total, including crews from Summit Fire, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Red, White & Blue Fire Protection District.
Update at 3:04 p.m.: The fire is in the trees above the shooting range, according to Summit Fire & EMS spokesperson Steve Lipsher.
""It is up in the trees a little bit,"" Lipsher said. ""We're hesitant to put firefighters up there because with the wind, the trees have been falling. So we have an air attack on its way.""
Lipsher said the cause of the fire hasn't been determined.
Community members are being asked to avoid the area.
Original story:
Firefighters are working to douse a fire at the Summit County Shooting Range near U.S. Highway 6, according to Summit County Sheriff Jaime FitzSimons.
FitzSimons said the blaze reached about 2.5 acres in size. He added that it would take an estimated eight hours before the fire would be fully contained.
The shooting range is closed until further notice, FitzSimons said. Drivers should expect delays along Highway 6 near the shooting range, according to the Colorado State Patrol.

Fire crews and their air resources are working around the Grizzly Creek Fire perimeter to slow the blaze's progress, but containment remained at 0% Monday evening, an incident management team spokesperson said.
""It doesn't sound like we're making much progress, saying zero percent containment,"" said Brian Scott, a Great Basin National Incident Type 1 Management Team spokesperson. ""But we really are making progress. We just can't call any part of the fire line solid enough to count it as contained.""
Now the largest wildfire in the history of the White River National Forest , the Grizzly Creek Fire started Aug. 10 along Interstate 70 and has since grown to about 25,000 acres.
""The severity of the terrain in the area is part of the reason we haven't been able to put a lot of boots on the ground in some of the spots around the perimeter,"" Scott said. ""Instead, we've had to back off to better terrain to put our fire lines in.""
Resources such as hand crews, engines, firefighting equipment and air support are streaming in each day. As of Monday morning, 647 personnel were combatting the flames with support of more than 50 vehicles and 17 helicopters, according to a Great Basin news release.
""We've had no injuries so far, which is extremely fortunate on a fire this size,"" Scott said. ""But three structures were lost: a cabin and two out-buildings.""
Later in the week, potential thunderstorms won't likely bring much precipitation, Scott said, but the management team is concerned about the possibility of lightning and high winds brought by the storms.
""For the last couple of days, we've had winds come in from the north,"" he explained. ""Which is good, because they've been slowing the fire's progress by folding it back on itself.""
Fire crews worked Monday with dozers to build containment lines in several locations around the fire, but a primary focus was west of No Name Creek.
""They've been putting indirect line -- line ahead of the fire,"" Scott said. ""If the fire comes up out of No Name Creek, they're working to ensure we can stop it on the ridge before it progresses further west.""
FROM ABOVE
As firefighters toil on the ground, helicopters and planes -- large and small -- buzz the fire area, dropping buckets of water or fire retardant on the blaze or monitoring the situation from the birds-eye view.
As seen with many of the smaller fires leading up to the Grizzly Creek Fire , Garfield County has access to several quick-acting air resources.
Measured by ""type"" from 1 to 3, with 3 being the smallest resource, the Rife Garfield County airport is home to a Type 1 helicopter, Type 3 helicopter and several Single Engine Air Tankers (SEAT ), U.S. Forest Service Spokesperson David Boyd said.
""We have a lot of people and urban interface in this area, which plays a role in where air resources are stationed,"" Boyd explained. ""But Rifle is also centrally located in the region.""
Boyd works with the Upper Colorado River Interagency Fire and Aviation Management Unit (UCR Fire), which is a partnership between the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service based in the Garfield County area.
The Type 3 helicopter based in Rifle is a UCR Fire resource, which can be assigned to fires in the group's coverage area, but the Type 1 and SEAT s are national resources.
""National resources may be based here, but they can be sent around the country to fight fires,"" Boyd said. ""So, it's not always a guarantee they're available if something pops up around here.""
Additionally, several heavy air tankers are based in Grand Junction and a group of very large air tankers is temporarily based in Colorado Springs, he said.
""T ypically, the helicopters are dropping water on the fire,"" Boyd said. ""And the air tankers drop the retardant, which slows the fire.""
All of these nearby aircraft grant local fire crews access to a pool of air resources for expedient response to wildfires around the region.
""We work really closely with the local fire departments in the county,"" Boyd said. ""So, they know what's available and can call in for support immediately.""
Even so, with the right conditions, fires can spread quicker than crews -- aerial or otherwise -- can establish containment, leading to fires like Grizzly Creek.
In response, the call goes out for more firefighters and more air resources.
As of Monday, 17 helicopters were combating the Grizzly Creek Fire. Nine Type 1's, one Type 2 and seven Type 3's, Scott said.
NO WORD YET ON I-70 REOPENING
As recent photographs of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon document, currently I-70 features impassible conditions with large boulders strewn around the roadway.
I-70 continues to be closed between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum, with no estimated time for
reopening. Forest Service Road 400, Eagle-Thomasville Road, is closed due to excessive traffic and accidents resulting from drivers attempting to use this primarily dirt road as an alternate to the I-70 closure. Cottonwood Pass Road in Garfield and Eagle counties, Coffee Pot Road, T ransfer Trail and Clinetop Mesa roads and areas of the Flattops accessed by those roads also are closed, as well as many surrounding White River National Forest and BLM roads. For more information regarding road closure, visit cotrip.org.
For more information, go to the Grizzly Creek Fire Facebook page, the Garfield County website at Garfield-county.com or ecemergency.org. The next Grizzly Creek Fire community meeting will be held virtually today at 6 p.m. To tune into the meeting in English, go to the Grizzly Creek Fire Facebook page.

June 20, 2020  Durang o Herald, The (CO)  Shannon Mullane; Pine River Valley reporter
While fire crews work to contain three wildfires in Southwest Colorado, one small fire, north of Pagosa Springs, has grown more complex.
The Sand Creek Fire, in a remote area on the Pagosa Ranger District, has grown to 25 acres, a significant growth from Friday when it covered 12 acres, said Esther Godson, San Juan National Forest spokesperson. Because of standing dead trees and heavy downed tree hazards, responding to the fire is difficult and dangerous for fire crews. In response, the U.S. Forest Service will increase its response to the fire Sunday.
""It's in such a remote and difficult to access area. That means it's going to become a longerduration fire ,"" Godson said. ""Given the safety hazards and the limited access available, we're bringing in a Type 3 incident management team.""
The local San Juan National Forest Type 3 Incident Management Team will assume command. Type 3 IMT s are deployed when more personnel are required to respond as a fire grows larger, when more resources are required and/or as the response to the fire grows more complex, for example when multiple agencies are involved.
The Sand Creek Fire was started by a lightning storm last weekend. It is burning in the 2012 Little Sand Fire scar and located 5 air miles north of the Piedra River and 2.5 miles south of Mosca Road.
Red Flag conditions, including wind and hot weather, contributed to the fire's growth. Helicopters have been providing water bucket drops on the incident daily. Smoke is visible from Piedra Road, Williams Reservoir and U.S. Highway 160 between Bayfield and Pagosa looking north.
The Forest Service also received smoke reports from community members Saturday and deployed firefighters to see if those are actual fires or smoke from existing fires, Godson said.
Fire restrictions are still in place.
""It's extreme fire danger this weekend. It's a really good thing we're getting reports of smoke from community members. That means we can get to the fire fast,"" she said.
East Canyon FireFire crews held steady in their effort to contain the East Canyon Fire near Mancos from Friday to Saturday morning. As of 8 a.m., the fire covered 2,900 acres with 21% containment. A total of 402 fire personnel were working the East Canyon Fire , which broke out Sunday on the La Plata-Montezuma County line as a result of a lightning strike from a lightning storm that passed through the region June 13.
Six Shooter FireThe Durango Interagency IMT 3 team maintained the Six Shooter Fire near Bondad at 75% containment and 224 acres, as of Saturday afternoon. The fire, located in Six Shooter Canyon on the Southern Ute Reservation, flared up Tuesday after a lightning strike from
the same storm.
Smoke from the fire has improved, according to a Southern Ute Indian T ribe news release. Stage 1 fire restrictions, which prohibit open burning, agricultural burning, campfires and fireworks, will remain in effect until conditions improve.
Loading Pen FireThe Loading Pen Fire, northwest of Durango in the Dolores River Valley, is about 90% contained as of Friday. The fire covers about 42 acres, and fire agencies estimate it will be fully contained by Monday. Smoke will continue to be visible to travelers along Colorado Highway 145.

Fire burning near Custer/Huerfano County line
WEST CLIFFE -- Crews were battling a 20-acre fire near the Custer/Huerfano County line just east of Custer County Road 458 in the Greenhorn Mountain area on Wednesday.
The fire, dubbed the ""Horse Ranch Fire,"" is burning in grass, aspen and standing dead trees near the 2019 Reveille Fire burn area on U.S. Forest Service Land, said Ralph Bella, fire information officer.
The fire was reported late Tuesday evening and a five-person engine crew is battling the blaze. Bella said the cause of the fire is under investigation.
There are no road closures or threatened structures.

In his final address to those following the Grizzly Creek Fire , Jeff Surber with the Great Basin Incident Management Team said there has been much success containing the fire in recent days.
Surber and the Great Basin team facilitated a routine transfer of management on the fire to the Alaska Interagency Incident Management Team on Tuesday; Surber said as that team takes command Wednesday, they expect containment levels will be near 50%.
The Grizzly Creek Fire, which started Aug. 10 and has burned 32,060 acres, now appears to be ""in mighty good shape,"" Alaska team Incident Commander Tom Kurth told the community in a Facebook live broadcast Tuesday.
""Our job is to organize the nearly 800 individuals here, and then we build them into a daily plan, keep them and you safe, protect your homes and community , your utility infrastructure, keep the roads and highways open, assist initial attack, and then build upon the work that this Great Basin team has left us with,"" Kurth said.
The Great Basin team ""has built certain expectations here,"" Kurth added. ""Work-wise, informationwise, and certainly working with cooperators here. So if we overlook something, let us know and we'll provide corrective behavior here.""
Dangerous areas remain
Surber said as the Alaska team attempts to wrap up the fire, challenges could occur in containing certain areas where the risk of standing dead trees, or snags, make it dangerous for firefighters to fight the fire on the ground. The Great Basin team has set up alternative plans to deal with those areas.
""We're kind of letting things take their own course in there, keeping people watching it, so if it tries to escape, we can jump on it and take action,"" Surber said.
For these areas, where wildfires can smolder for weeks before popping up again, Surber offered a warning .
""My understanding is they've had fires here that they've considered contained, or that they've pretty much laid down for a month, and then the fuel continues to dry out into September or even October, and an edge like that will have one tree fall over and then what happens is that fuel that's not ready to burn now -- we can't light it on fire because there's just enough fuel moisture not to carry fire well, but in another month, if you don't get rain, it will burn readily.""
Surber said a pre-constructed contingency fire line farther up the slope, from where fighters can keep tabs on the snag-heavy areas, will prove helpful in those areas in the coming weeks.
""It's a watching game,"" Surber said. ""Or, if you get to the point where you have a big wind storm -- 50 mile-per-hour winds -- and everything blows down, and they start feeling comfortable that the weak trees all blew over already, they might walk in there.""
Rain possible
Surber said rain also could affect the outcome of certain areas of the fire in the days to come.
While the fire burned on the west side of Eagle County on Tuesday, the east side of the county enjoyed downpour conditions for about an hour.
Meteorologist Kris Sanders with the National Weather Service in Grand Junction said similar rainstorms could pop up over the next few days, but areas of higher elevation than the Grizzly Creek Fire are likely to see more rain.
""We've had a lot of moisture, some of this high pressure that's been meandering around the Four Corners region, so we just happened to be in a good fetch over the past couple of days, where moisture has been moving into the area,"" said Kris Sanders with the National Weather Service.
The storms have been accompanied by lightning, which has created spot fires in the area in recent days. The most recent suspected lightning fire occurred Tuesday northeast of Rifle, said White River National Forest Deputy Forest Supervisor Lisa Stoeffler.
Stoeffler said the new fire is roughly 5 to 10 acres in size.
""We have ground crews on it, and helicopters on it, and expect that they are going to pay attention to that through the evening,"" she said. ""We'll chase after those lightning fires as they pop up, and use the team as available to help us with that.""
Stoeffler also urged locals and visitors to be extra cautious with fire .
""T hings are tinder dry and resources are stretched way too tight to be dealing with another fire,"" she said.

Fire_damage_to_Rocky_Mountain_National_Parks__Sky-Hi_News_Granby_CO___June_18_2021.txt,"Fire damage to Ro cky M o untain Natio nal Park's - Sky-Hi Ne ws (Granby, CO ) - June 18, 2021
Green Mountain Trail lost most of its green in the East Troublesome Fire.
The Rocky Mountain National Park trail -- which saw up to 10,000 visitors per month in the summer -- is currently closed due to fire hazards. The burn scar and accompanying wind event left the once-dense lodgepole pine forest wrecked and ravaged.
""This is some of the hottest, most destroyed sections of trails we have here on the west side of the park,"" said Doug Parker, trails program supervisor at Rocky, during a guided tour on Thursday. ""It is a really good (representation) of the damage that we see throughout the backcountry.""
Green Mountain Trail is 1.8 of the 54 miles of trails that burned at Rocky Mountain National Park last summer. Of those burned, 33 miles are on the west side of the park. Rocky has a total of 350 miles of trail in the park system.
The forest that once framed the steep trail is now a scattered scar across the hillsides. According to Koren Nydick, Rocky Mountain National Park's chief of resource stewardship, those dead trees are actually helping ""keep the hillside on the hillside.""
Digging into the exposed dirt along the trail, Nydick demonstrated the variation in soil damage that occurred during the fast-moving fire leading to an increased flooding risk. Root structures remain in some areas along the trail but not others.
""Over here where you had a smoldering log, there's not soil structure in here,"" Nydick said. ""There are little bits of roots, but they're not really connected. They're burned up.""
Nydick explained that the area is not as devastated as some watersheds in other fires because the flames didn't take all the organic matter. That's visible in the black charcoal that was left behind -- if there was less organic matter, which makes it harder for plants to regrow, more white ash would be visible.
There are a couple hypotheses as to why the burn intensity wasn't as severe.
""You've heard how the fire was a very fast moving fire in most areas -- that means that there's less time for it to really cook the soil in one spot,"" Nydick said. ""Also, the soils were very dry when it happened, so you didn't have the steaming action that can happen where you're actually cooking the soils from within ... Also, as you know, snow fell on the fire. There was the cooling effect from the snow.""
Much of the soil is not going to be hydrophobic, or unable to absorb water. Even so, post-flooding events and debris movement are a worry along the trail.
Green Mountain's watershed is small but steep. In a post fire assessment, a modeled storm could
cause runoff that is 2,000% more than the pre-fire runoff for a similar storm.
The culvert at the bottom of the trail is high up on the park's list of worries during rain, as it could blow out the road if blocked. Luckily, there are no structures near the bottom of the Green Mountain Trail that would be at elevated risk of flooding.
To get the trail up and running is another issue. It sits in between two steep hillsides, which means water flows continue to damage the already wrecked trail.
""If you hike further up the trail, you're going to see a lot of old bridges that burned and you're going to see a lot of nails, spikes sticking out of the ground, debris,"" Parker said. ""The trail has been cleared for the most part, but there's still a lot of downed material up there. It's really hazardous to hike in right now.""
The steep trail had been built using extensive infrastructure, including bridges and retainer bars. With most of that to be replaced, Parker and trails staff are considering whether rerouting the trail could improve its longevity and reduce its reliance on infrastructure.
""This is an area we're really going to consider -- can we make this a better trail for the next 10, 20, 30 years from now?"" Parker said. ""... What we can do now is take this opportunity to see if there's a better alignment that doesn't require as many bridges and infrastructure materials, so if the next fire or next flood comes through, then we have a trail that's more resilient going forward.""
He added that there is no specific timeline to reopen Green Mountain Trail.
""It's going to be closed for as long as it takes us to lay it out and rebuild it, so it could be years,"" Parker said.
The creek that flows alongside Green Mountain Trail was babbling through the burn scar Thursday. In the flatter, riparian areas green plants have sprouted and a few mountain lupines have already bloomed among the ashes.
Nydick said that its possible that the lodgepole forest could come back, depending on if the seed bank survived the fire -- something she thinks could still be viable. Rocky has no plans to remove the burned trees or reseed the wilderness areas, so how it recovers will be up to Mother Nature.
The forest that stood before the East Troublesome Fire was nearly 200 years old, so it's uncertain whether Green Mountain Trail will ever look the same again.
""Under the conditions that this forest originally grew, the climate was different,"" Nydick said. ""Now the seedlings that are able to start coming up from seeds, they're going to experience a different climate . It will depend, are we going to get another droughty summer? What's going to happen in the next five, 10 years with climate change on top of natural variability?
""I think that's going to affect how well the current vegetation does here -- whether it's able to come back as a lodgepole pine forest or if we're having other species move in. To be honest, I can't tell you that.""
Further research is necessary to understand the post-fire impacts, and a study is already underway at Rocky Mountain National Park. Nydick added that the mosaic of burned and unburned habitat, which increases the variety of ages and types of forest throughout Rocky, helps to support biodiversity.
Looking at the black hillside of fallen trees, Nydick said she mostly felt curious to see how the area will recover.
""I'm not feeling very sad because this is a lodgepole forest and this is what lodgepole forests do,"" Nydick said. ""They have stand-replacing fires. That's been the natural fire regime in these forests for thousands of years.""

Fire_educators_are_urging_Routt_County_residents__Steamboat_Pilot_Today_CO___May_7_2021.txt,"Fire e ducato rs are urging Ro utt County re side nts - Ste ambo at Pilo t & To day (CO ) - May 7, 2021
Local homeowners, property owners and agricultural businesses should prepare their properties' defenses.
Defensive space, home ignition zones and structural ignitability were the key educational messages Thursday evening during the second webinar of the 2021 Routt County Wildfire Conference presented by the nonprofit Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Council.
Presenter Dan Beveridge, wildfire mitigation program specialist with the Colorado State Forest Service, stressed that of the three factors that shape wildfires in the fire behavior triangle -- topography, weather and fuel -- the only factor that property owners can control is fuel. Those fire fuels include structures, trees, shrubs, pine needles, grasses, timber understory and litter, slash and blowdown.
Beveridge said the home ignition zone, or the area around and on the home that determines ignition potential, includes layers up to 100 feet from a home. Structures can ignite from embers, surface fire or radiantheat.
The first 5 feet surrounding a home are the most important and should not have any flammable materials present, such as stacked firewood, tall grasses, overhanging branches or wood chips. Class A fire -rated roofs and metal siding on the lower perimeter of a house are good techniques to improve ""structural ignitability"" or ""home hardening,"" Beveridge said.
""Anything done to harden the home reduces the chance for damage or loss. Every single thing you do really improves the odds,"" Beveridge said.
The next zone, 5 to 30 feet from a home, should be free of horizontal or vertical linkages of flammable materials, such as tightly spaced trees and contiguous plantings. Plantings can be in clumps, but those groupings should be 10 feet apart. High grasses should be mowed to 4 inches, he said.
Presenter Todd Hagenbuch, Routt County CSU Extension director and agriculture agent, asked agricultural property owners to consider, ""Are you and your property ready for a wildfire?"" Hagenbuch said the reality for most farmers and ranchers is, ""No, you are not.""
""Having plans and mitigation efforts in place now can help ensure you make it through a wildfire event with less damages. That ultimately saves you time and money in a business where time and money are scarce commodities,"" Hagenbuch said.
The extension agent encouraged land owners to contact the local office of the Colorado State Forest Service to request further information on how to lower a property's wildfire risk. He said fire mitigation planning should be done in coordination with adjacent neighbors.
When preparing for potential wildfires, Hagenbuch asked people to consider, ""What would be the worst thing for you to have damaged or lose from a personal perspective, from a business perspective and an ethical perspective?""
He encouraged agricultural operators to consider which outbuilding would be most important to save, what is important or hazardous that is stored in each building, can heavy firefighting trucks safely make it onto the property and turn around, and what equipment is insured. For example, if a $100,000 tractor is insured, focusing on moving the most precious livestock could be more important, Hagenbuch said.
After formal presentations, viewers asked about concerns ranging from, ""Should propane tanks be buried?"" to ""Where do I start at home that is most important to reduce ember ignition?""
Beveridge said buried propane tanks are safer from fire danger. If not buried, propane tanks should be 30 feet away from structures with no flammable materials within 10 feet of the tanks.
Speaking from experience from his years as a wildland firefighter, Beveridge said a home's roof and deck are the first areas to address with fire wise construction and maintenance as they are large horizontal surfaces where embers can land from a fire a mile away. He warned against storing combustible materials or debris piles under decks. Any place that pine needles could blow into and collect, such as in gutters and roof junctures, should be cleaned out regularly or protected with metal flashing as embers can collect in those same places.
""Embers are the leading cause of home ignition and damage or loss,"" he said.
Beveridge stressed that creating a defensive space around a home or structure does not mean clearcutting, and it does mean fire personnel would use the space to defend the home.
""Defensive space should be thought of as a means of minimizing fire behavior so the home can defend itself"" and withstand a fire on its own, he said.

Grand Fire Protection District No. 1 Assistant Fire Chief Schelly Olson has devoted the past 13 years of her professional life to fighting, learning, teaching and educating the public about fires.
Still, her family's home northwest of Grand Lake burned completely last October during the East Troublesome Fire. Nothing was left but the concrete foundation and some metal items. Even toilets were pulverized, Olson said, an indication of the extreme heat that consumed the 4,100square-foot custom log home.
""It's crazy. You spend your career working on wildfire preparedness, then it happens to you,"" Olson said. ""It's the most devastating thing I've ever gone through professionally and personally.""
The East Troublesome Fire, which grew to become the second largest wildfire in Colorado history, started 15 miles northeast of Kremmling late in the fire season Oct. 14, 2020. Of the 366 homes burned, eight belonged to first responders, Olson said.
Considering her extensive training, Olson wondered if she could have done something different to save her family's home, built in 2004. But, unfortunately, fire conditions the evening of Oct. 21 were extraordinary for the Colorado high country, where her home was located at 8,600 feet in elevation. The nearby weather station reported at 10 p.m. that winds were 100 miles per hour, relative humidity was at 10%, and it was 72 degrees.
Olson will share her fire lessons learned as a presenter at the final session of this year's Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Conference on Thursday. The webinar titled ""Community Lessons Learned -- Preparedness and Recovery"" starts at 5 p.m. Attendees can preregister at RouttWildfire.org, which also links to recordings of the first three webinars and other resources.
""My message to Routt and Grand counties is that, although not all fires are like the East Troublesome Fire, we still need to be both vigilant and diligent about doing mitigation around our homes if we choose to live in the wildland-urban interface,"" said Olson, who serves as chair of the nonprofit Grand County Wildfire Council started in 2013.
When the East Troublesome Fire blew up by some 100,000 acres and swept through neighborhoods, Olson was taking a well-deserved break on a short vacation to Florida with a friend after serving 50 days straight as a public information officer and planning section chief on the Williams Fork Fire , also in Grand County. Her husband, Jeff, at home with the family dog, had not signed up for CodeRED emergency alerts on his cellphone. Family members called to tell him of the preevacuation order.
Then Schelly Olson received a call from a fire captain on scene monitoring the severity of the situation who said, ""T ell Jeff to get out now."" She called her husband, who was outside with smoke all around frantically trying to remove flammable items from the home's deck. He jumped in the family SUV, driving away south toward Granby as he could see an orange glow in the distance. The
sound of the fire was roaring like a speeding freight train.
""Everyone thought they had more time,"" Schelly said. ""People just did not realize how quickly the fire was going to move, how extreme it was going to be and how hot it was going to get.""
The fire educator urges all residents to register all phone lines with local emergency notification systems. For Routt County, registration is not automatic for any phone except for CenturyLink and Comcast landlines, according to Routt County Emergency Management officials. All residents are urged to opt-in their cell numbers at RouttCountyAlerts.com.
Schelly said her most precious losses in the fire were her great-grandparents' heirlooms and her scrapbooks filled with family memories and childhood drawings from her two now-grown daughters. On the positive side, the family home was well insured, and the Grand County Wildfire Emergency Fund established at the Grand Foundation provided significant assistance in the community .
Aaron Voos, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Forest Service, noted of the East Troublesome Fire ignition, ""We cannot say that it was human caused due to the ongoing investigation."" Schelly said the Grand County Sheriff is seeking approval to increase the fines for illegal fires from $100 to $500 for the first offense.
Olson urges residents to be thorough with fire mitigation efforts in the home ignition zone, such as cleaning out dead leaves and dried pine needles from house gutters, ""because even the smallest thing could be an ignition point.""
""You can't control where the embers from the wildfire will land, but you can control what will happen when they do land,"" Schelly said.

FIRE_LINES_Dan_Gibbs_wildland_firefighter_state__Gazette_The_Colorado_Springs_CO___November_11_2020.txt,"FIRE LINES: Dan Gibbs, wildland fire fighte r/state - Gaze tte , The (Colorado Springs, CO ) - No ve mbe r 11, 20 20
November 11, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Marianne Goodland
An occasional series of conversations with experts on the science and policies regarding fires.
Last month, Dan Gibbs, whose day job is as executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, got up close and personal with the Cameron Peak fire as it raged through more than 200,000 acres of the Arapaho-Roosevelt national forests near Glen Haven.
There were times when he stood a foot away from the flames.
Buthe wasn't there to monitor what the fires would do to watersheds. Gibbs was there as a Type 2 Certified Wildland firefighter, a volunteer job he's held since 2007. He's been on the front lines of the recent fires, both at Cameron Peak and in August at the Grizzly Creek fire near Glenwood Spring s.
What does a firefighter think of, so close to the flames that can turn in a second from the winds?
How to get out.
It's part of the training, Gibbs explained. It's physical labor, all day long, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. many days. He likened it to doing Crossfit for 16 hours straight. ""You're digging fire lines with tools with names like Pulaskis, chainsaws and rabbits,"" he said.
One of the main jobs is to clear fuels -- that's anything flammable, such as brush and trees -- away from the homes they were trying to save.
If the fire was approaching a house, they would go right up to the fire line and dig trenches and clear vegetation. Homes with a defensible space have a fighting chance, Gibbs said.
Many of the homes are heated with propane tanks, and they would spray the tanks with foam to prevent them from exploding. They didn't win them all. Once, when they were spray-foaming a tank, they heard a large boom. It was the tank at the house next to them.
Cameron Peak was unique, Gibbs said. The winds would gust up to 50 or 60 miles per hour, which not only would blow someone over, but create uncertainty that can be life-threatening to firefig hters.
""We're constantly thinking, how do I get out of here?"" Gibbs said. At one home, fire burned one side of the property, and while they saved the house, the fire went from the northside to the south, and that's where the propane tank was. There was just one way out, on the driveway, with fire on both sides of it.
In those situations, there are a lot of ""snags"" -- trees coming down -- and firefighters worry that
a snag would come down on that road and block their only escape route.
""That's the reality of a lot of fire situations,"" Gibbs said.
State and federal call-ups
Gibbs went through the Colorado Wildland Fire and Incident Academy in 2007. Minimum qualifications include a ""red card,"" a federal credential that allows a firefighter to go on federal lands. Everything has a credential, even the equipment, he said.
The fires he's fought in 2020 have largely been on federal lands. Gibbs is on both the state and federal call-up system. When they call, he goes. He's not part of a regular crew, but gets plugged in with teams when he shows up to a staging area.
It's not a job that you go home from at the end of the day. Firefighters stay on site, often sleeping on the ground near the areas that they had just extinguished. One night they slept in an area where the fuels had burned away, Gibbs said. The fire was still all around them but they were in a safe zone. ""At night, the skies looked like the Fourth of July,"" he said.
He was also the oldest member of the crew he was on at Cameron Peak. ""This is a young person's sport,"" he said.
On his Facebook page in late October, Gibbs said the week was ""unsettling, exhilarating and emotionally draining to say the least ... This was perhaps one of my most intense deployments as our team was directly attacking the fire by digging fire lines, engaging in structure protection and building defensible space.""
Gibbs added that the ""persistent high winds and intense smoke were some of the worst I have ever encountered and many of my teammates agreed.
""I can't say enough about my team on the Cameron Peak Fire and all the wildland firefighters who are at this very moment risking their lives to save homes and our communities. Many I served with had no health insurance or were from seasoned out hotshot crews. We must explore ways to give these men and women the resources they need to be as safe and effective as possible and explore making these positions permanent because fire season is now no longer seasonal.""
Now that the fires are approaching containment -- Cameron Peak is now at 92% containment, according to InciWeb, the federal incident information system -- Gibbs has gone back to his day job, which will involve the aftermath.
Protecting the watershed
Among DNR's first tasks is to protect rivers and other natural resources from the fire impacts.
Fires like Cameron Peak and Grizzly Creek, which ran alongside the Colorado River through Glenwood Canyon, have huge impacts on water supplies, Gibbs explained. A grant program from DNR's Colorado Water Conservation Board will deal with watershed restoration and flood
mitigation. (A watershed is a surface area from which runoff from rainfall drains to a common point, ranging in size from streams to lakes, rivers and oceans. Virtually all lands are technically part of a watershed.) That program is designed to help affected communities develop planning and engineering strategies to mitigate flood and debris flow risks post-fire.
Another DNR-managed program: mitigation grants, which help pay to create defensible space around buildings and infrastructure, including water supplies. Grant funds supported by DNR also provide forest restoration.
CWCB also has a tool known as FACE, short for ""future avoided cost explorer"" -- to help educate counties and local governments on the potential future costs of wildfires, floods, and drought as the climate changes and Colorado's population grows, to encourage long-term, resilient planning.
Another challenge is breaking down ""silos"" that exist between federal, state, tribal agencies and private landowners in dealing with the aftermath of wildfires and how to deal with them in the future. Gibbs said fires don't know the difference between those kinds of landscapes. He believes there is better collaboration on wildfire issues, due in part to a ""shared stewardship"" memorandum of understanding between the state and the U.S. Forest Service, signed in October, 2019.
Part of that MOU will involve creating a map inventory. ""We don't know exactly"" what counties are doing about forest thinning on their open space, or what the feds, state and tribal lands have done, he said. ""No one has ever coordinated a mapping exercise."" That map will identify the gaps and where the partners can get the most bang for the buck through collaboration. Restoration and mitigation efforts are something of a patchwork quilt right now, Gibbs said. The MOU will help everyone figure out what to collaborate on.
Climate change and management
The other issue for DNR is climate change. Gibbs pointed out that the 20 largest fires in Colorado have all happened in the last 20 years. T emperatures are climbing, and on average are higher than during the 1930s dust bowl. Then there's drought. The entire state is in drought, and 74% is in D3 and D4 drought, the worst drought conditions.
Angela Boag, DNR's policy advisor on climate change and forest management, said what's on her mind is the implications fires have both for wildlife and forests. Fires cause reductions in streamflows in summer and fall, and that affects wildlife and fish habitats.
That means working with researchers in the division of parks and wildlife to see how wildlife adapt to climate change.
""Climate change amplifies the problems we already have,"" Boag said. Those problems include 100 years of suppressing fires, which has led to a ton of fuel ready to burn. Hotter temperatures contribute to more extreme drought, and then add in the challenges from people moving into the wildland-urban interface, or recreating in forest areas.
Climate change adds fuel to that perfect storm, Boag explained, making those forests more likely to burn. ""We have to be more strategic in managing the forest ... We need to know where
we're doing vegetation treatments, forest thinning"" and how to connect those treatments. Prescribed burns is also another tool, she added. ""We need to remember that fire is a natural part of ecosystems,"" so long as key values, such as homes and infrastructure, including water supplies, are not at risk.
Gibbs said one of the biggest challenges is that a million Coloradans live in wildland-urban interface areas. A hundred years ago, you could let the forest in those unpopulated areas burn, but today those are population centers, he said.
He acknowledged that county commissioners are under tremendous pressure to approve new developments, and he would know, since he spent eight years as a Summit County commissioner.
But when he's out on the fire lines, trying to protect a home that's next to a wilderness boundary, he's thinking ""who approved this?""
Gibbs said if he had a magic wand, he'd tie community wildfire protection plans -- required for communities with fire risks -- to development codes. That would then require county commissioners to think about the potential wildfire activity that could happen before they approve a development, and many counties do that, but not all.
Until that happens, Gibbs urges people who live in that wildland-urban interface to take responsible actions for their own lands and create defensible spaces.
Gibbs has been working on these issues for years. It isn't only his interest as a wildland firefighter. He spent three years in the General Assembly, one in the House and two in the Senate, and even then the fires called him. He missed Opening Day of the 2009 session when he was called up to help fight a fire in Boulder County. Shortly after, he traveled to Washington, D.C., to advocate for funding to fight the mountain pine beetle epidemic.
The beetle has been one of Gibbs' constant companions, sometimes literally. He once brought a bark beetle prop -- a small log -- to the state Capitol to show the devastation the beetle can create. Unfortunately, the log got left sitting on a window ledge, and heat warmed it, as well as the beetle larva inside. They hatched.
That led to a beetle infestation on the southwest wing of the Capitol's third floor and a visit by fumig ators.
""It's one way to bring the issue of foresthealth to the Capitol,"" Gibbs quipped.

October 28, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Marianne Goodland
This is the first in a series of conversations with experts on the policies regarding fires.
Mike Lester, Colorado's state forester and director of the Colorado State Forest Service at Colorado State University, views the East Troublesome fire and the others that have devastated Colorado this fall as an investment.
""We need to invest in our forests,"" he recently told Colorado Politics. ""When we total up the bill for this fire season, that's an investment,"" but maybe not the kind most people would want to make.
Nobody plans to have wildfires like this, and the choice is to invest in foresthealth or invest in fighting the wildfires. ""Nothing is free,"" he said.
What should be the investment: getting the ""fuel load"" -- millions of trees ripe for fires -- down, and getting forests back to their natural state.
""We've become so effective at suppressing wildfires"" that the fuel load just continues to build. Instead of a light- to moderate-intensity fire, Colorado ends up with catastrophic fires.
There's no question that fire seasons are getting longer and the opportunity for those catastrophic fires is growing. ""If you had told me five years ago we'd have fires this big in October, I wouldn't have believed it,"" Lester said.
He noted that 64% of Colorado's lands are federally managed. Over the last dozen years, the feds -- everyone's ""favorite whipping boy, but they don't deserve it"" -- have been as aggressive as they can be with a limited budget to manage foresthealth. ""I have a lot of admiration for them. They're asked to do the job with both hands tied behind their backs,"" and that's regardless of who sits in the White House or who controls Congress.
Those efforts also come despite the growing integration of people into wildlands. Those lands aren't far from civilization anymore, with decent-sized towns in the middle of forests, Lester said.
Another problem: a lack of a sound forest products industry -- a fancy way to say timber mills -- and that's not easily solvable. Colorado has just one, in Montrose, and the cost of transporting timber devastated by beetle kill is not profitable. ""You have to pay people to take the timber off the land"" rather than someone wanting to buy that timber, he explained. The only other nearby mill is in southern Wyoming, but it's not large enough to cover the volume of timber that could come from Colorado forests.
Lester said there are lots of arguments about what causes these wildfire events, which he says is kind of silly. ""We know why"": changes in the distribution of trees and insect species.
T ake the mountain pine beetle, which eats ponderosa and lodgepole pines. That's the insect that has destroyed 5 million acres of trees since the mid-1990s. Winter weather and cold temperatures in the 30- to 35-below-zero range used to keep the beetles in check, Lester said. But Colorado no longer gets that cold at the elevations where the beetles live.
What's to be done? Lester said that collaboration among a lot of agencies -- not just between the state and the feds -- is the best solution at hand for now. That now includes the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, Denver Water, Colorado Springs Utilities, Northern Water and even some non-agency groups like the Coalition for the Upper South Platte.
That kind of collaboration is essential, given the shortage of financial resources, even before the economic downturn due to the pandemic.
There's also the issue of climate change. ""It's very real,"" Lester said. In the wildfires, climate change has manifested itself with a longer fire season and greater propensity for drought.
""This is what grabs us by the throat,"" he said.
What Lester and his team will be watching for once the fires are out is what happens to the soil. There will be a lot of it sliding down hills, and that will take two to four years to stabilize, he said.
The danger is that some of that sliding soil will head toward reservoirs, hence the involvement of water utilities and providers. Lester said that silt and debris will cover roads and fill reservoirs, which becomes an expensive problem to mitigate.
Regenerating the forests will also be difficult. When hundreds of thousands of acres of trees burn, that also burns the seeds that would help the forests rebuild on their own. As a result, people have to step in, and it will take centuries for those trees to come back.
Lester pointed to the Hayman fire from 2002, which burned more than 138,000 acres. The US Forest Service has been replanting in the area, at about 1,000 acres per year. ""You're talking hundreds of years to regenerate these forests,"" Lester said.
The other impact is to the species that call those forests home, and their native habitat is now gone. ""Clean air, clean water, habitat, all the things that forests do can't happen if the trees aren't there.""
""We've known for quite some time"" that these wildfires weren't going to hold off forever,"" Lester said. He likened it to Hurricane Katrina and the failure of levees to hold back the floods. ""They knew the levees had problems,"" but there were a lot of other things that got the priority for funding.
""Fire is a part of our ecosystem"" and it's not necessarily a bad thing when the forests are in decenthealth. But the wildland-urban interface makes the stakes higher, Lester said.

February 23, 2021  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Marianne Goodland
An occasional series of conversations with experts on the science and policies regarding fires.
The conversation about foresthealth, climate change and last year's wildfireseason moved to the money side this week, with four bills dealing with mitigation and fire suppression on the ag enda.
Monday, the House Agriculture, Livestock and Water Committee signed off on House Bill 1008, which would allow local communities to set up their own special districts to finance local mitigation projects.
It's worth noting that the state's wish list for mitigation funding is in the ballpark of $750 million, just for the most urgent areas. It would take $2.4 billion to fund all mitigation projects in unhealthy forests, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
State officials have said mitigation alone won't solve the problem, but neither will fire suppression. It's a balancing act, they've told Colorado Politics.
Money is cobbled together in fits and starts: some coming from the federal government, some from the state. The point of HB 1008 would be to allow local communities to assess themselves a special property tax to fund mitigation projects in their areas.
During Monday's hearing, bill sponsor Rep. Marc Catlin, R-Montrose, said that a little mitigation work might have saved watersheds damaged in the 2020 blazes. The idea of special district funding is good government, he added. That was echoed by Rep. Perry Will, R-New Castle, in whose district the Pine Gulch fire burned for two months last year. ""We wouldn't have been in that situation if we'd done this bill last year,"" he said.
The creation of a special district is an opt-in, meaning it's up to the local communities to approve them.
The idea comes out of the Southwest Colorado Impact Fund, whose leadership includes former Sen. Ellen Roberts, R-Durango. Attorney Bob Cole of Collins, Cockrel & Cole, representing SWiF, said the group has identified three areas where legislation would help:
Creating a financing authority, the special district;Allowing the special district to finance foresthealth projects through a special assessment; andGranting the local governments the legal authority to do those foresthealth projects, some of which could be on private land.
""We're facing a foresthealth crisis,"" said State Forester Mike Lester of the Colorado State Forest Service at Colorado State University. He told the committee that half the population of Colorado now lives in what's known as the ""wildland-urban interface,"" areas of the state adjacent to forests
and where forest mitigation has become a necessity. Forests face challenges of drought and climate change, with 50% affected by wildfires or disease within the last 20 years, he explained.
The bill won a 11-0 vote from the committee and now heads to the House Finance Committee. Will noted at the hearing's conclusion that $1 in mitigation saves between $3 and $6 in firefighting costs.
In related news, the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday passed a slew of supplemental bills designed to realign state agency budgets for 2020-21, including three bills tied to mitigation and firefighting costs. All the supplementals passed the committee and are headed to the full Senate.
Among them: $13 million, divided three ways, for mitigation projects, wildfire preparedness and to fund watershed restoration within the Department of Natural Resources.
Senate Bill 54 puts $6 million into the Forest Restoration and Wildfire Risk Mitigation Grant Program Cash Fund, for grants to reduce hazardous fuels, such as dead trees, to reduce the potential risk for wildlife damage to property, infrastructure or water supplies.
The wildfire preparedness fund got $3 million, to be matched with federal dollars, to assist local governments with strategic planning to prevent wildfires.
An additional $4 million would go to the Colorado Water Conservation Board within DNR to work on damage to watersheds from the 2020 wildfires, most notably, the East Troublesome Fire in Grand County. Sen. Bob Rankin, R-Carbondale, told the committee that federal funds to help pay for other watershed restoration projects are also in the works. He had a $10 million amendment at the ready for those other projects, but said he would hold it until they know what they're getting from the federal government.
But the relatively small amounts in the face of $750 million in mitigation needs troubled at least one lawmaker.
Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, R-Sterling, raised concerns about whether there's a comprehensive plan for dealing with the watershed projects.
""We will have water quality issues"" when the snowmelt starts, more so for the communities impacted by the fires, he warned. ""I want to make sure we have a plan on how to deal with water quality issues"" from those fires.
""Four million dollars is not near enough, and I'm not sure an additional $10 million is near enough,"" Sonnenberg said. ""As we balance firefighting against mitigation, $15 million won't get the water quality we need from all the damage we have.""
The committee also greenlighted Senate Bill 113 to allow the Division of Fire Safety and Prevention within the Department of Public Safety to spend $30.8 million on the purchase of a Firehawk helicopter and to lease a Type 1 chopper. It will take United Rotorcraft of Englewood a year to retrofit a Blackhawk helicopter into the Firehawk, which is why the division wants to lease a
Type 1 chopper to have ready for the 2021 wildfireseason.
FIRE LINES: Colorado public safety officials hope to add top-of-the-line helicopter to aid in firefighting efforts
The Type 1 chopper can carry at least 700 gallons of water in its buckets, but because it uses buckets it can't fly over roads without closing those roads first, according to division director Mike Morgan. The Firehawk, on the other hand, can carry 1,000 gallons and does so with an enclosed container, making it more practical for urban fires, such as the Cherry Creek State Park and Bear Creek Lake Park fires earlier this month.
Sen. Steve Fenberg, D-Boulder, one of the bill's sponsors, told the committee that while the costs may seem exorbitant, this helicopter might not have been necessary a decade ago.
""We're now facing longer fire seasons ... and multiple massive fires at the same time in different parts of the state,"" Fenberg said.
He said he doesn't think the helicopters alone will fix the problem, and that the state needs to put just as much, if not more, on forest mitigation to ensure fires don't turn into massive ones. ""It's a smart investment that is unfortunately necessary,"" he said.
The third bill, Senate Bill 49, would direct $1.5 million toward the Colorado Firefighting Air Corps Fund and $7.3 million, both in general fund dollars, for aviation resources within the division.

It's a worst-case scenario that officials have to plan for: the evacuation of Estes Park due to the huge Cameron Peak Fire. The wildfire has burned more than 102,000 acres, is only 4% contained and will likely keep threatening lives and property until Mother Nature can provide enough rain and snow to help put it out.
Fire officials are now estimating the fire will not be out until the end of October with ""a long way to go."" More than a thousand fire personnel are working to contain the fire and protect the community .
Estes Park Health has enacted an Incident Command for the Cameron Peak Fire .
""The fire is currently burning in heavy timber over rugged terrain,"" wrote Estes Park Health Foundation Executive Director Kevin Mullin. ""The recent snowfall on 9/8 has allowed for additional supportive measures and containment lines to be placed. However, concerns remain for the Cameron Peak Fire 's future potential, as the weather warms again, to move into the Estes Valley from the Fall River Drainage in RMNP and the West Creek Drainage into Glen Haven.""
Mullin went on the write that ""we are NOT in imminent danger and no evacuation is intended at this point. The purpose at this point is entirely to plan in the event that action is required later during this fire event.""
The chances of that happening and Estes Park being evacuated stands at about 5%, according to a fire official who addressed the Larimer County Commissioners on Tuesday.
""It would be a Herculean effort to accomplish that,"" he said, ""especially on a weekend. We are certainly hoping that doesn't happen.""
According to the Cameron Peak Fire Facebook page, ""There is no imminent threat to the Estes Park area at this time. There have not been any further discussions regarding evacuations. Fire managers are continuing to develop plans for the area with County officials in extra caution only IF a need would arise at some point in the future.""
A map on the page shows the southern part of the wildfire in Rocky Mountain National Park only ten miles from Estes Park. A high heat index and low relative humidity remain big concerns.
Some good progress is being made on the Eastern edge of the fire, according to spokesperson Cody Carlson of Incident Management Team 3. Tuesday, Cameron Peak Fire officials lifted the voluntary evacuations for Glacier View.
Firefighters are still very concerned about the northern edge of the fire in an area they are calling the thumb.
""We've seen an increase in fire behavior there,"" Carlson said on Tuesday. ""We've been dumping a combination of water and retardant on this area trying to keep this part of the fire in check from wanting to move. That's the most fire activity right now. That's our biggest concern.""
Firefighters are creating bulldozer lines on ridge tops in the forest near the communities of Glen Haven, Drake and Storm Mountain, trying to eliminate the fire from moving toward these communities.
Despite challenging conditions, firefighters report they are closing some gaps.
""Progress was made on direct fire lines along the Buckhorn Road to Comanche Reservoir, Pingree Park Road and Highway 14,"" David Gesser, Southwest Area Team 3 Incident Commander wrote. ""Air operations will continue supporting ground crews as needed. In the coming days, once firefighters are able to secure existing fire lines and connect them together, containment will increase.""

On Wednesday, October 21, the East Troublesome Fire ran approximately 18 miles before it moved into the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park, where rapid evacuations began for the Grand Lake community and park staff. There appears to be some structure loss on the west side of the park, but initial assessment indicates that it is minimal. At this time, we are unable to fully assess those impacts.
On the morning of Thursday, October 22, a heat signature from the National Weather Service was picked up in the Spruce Creek drainage, on the east side of the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National Park. The East Troublesome Fire had spotted approximately 1.5 miles from the head of Tonahutu Creek to the head of Spruce Creek. Low clouds contributed to the challenge of assessing where smoke was coming from. Park fire lookouts from near the Ute Trail along Trail Ridge Road were able to confirm a smoke column out of Spruce Creek. Due to the location of the fire in the lower Spruce Creek drainage and confluence of Forest Canyon, evacuations began for areas of Estes Park. Humidity levels yesterday greatly assisted in stopping the fire growth and it appears it has remained in that general location. It is in the same general area as the Fern Lake Fire of 2012.
On the west side of the park, resources were focused on continual life and safety priorities and ongoing evacuations from the night before. Numerous trees were down on the west side of Trail Ridge Road, north of the Green Mountain Trailhead, blocking that area as a means to evacuate on Wednesday night, October 21. Weather conditions on the west of the Continental Divide were very different than the east side yesterday, with low humidity and winds continuing to add to the fire growth. As of last night, the East Troublesome Fire had moved north of the Coyote Valley Trailhead.

February 25, 2020  Summit Daily News (CO)  Scott Miller Vail Daily
Vail -- As Colorado's bark beetle infestations have faded, ideas have changed about the insects' impacts on mountain ecology and the prospects for wildfires in beetle-afflicted areas.
A current study of forest recovery by Robert Andrus, Sarah Hart and Thomas Veblen was recently published in the journal of the Ecological Society of America. Andrus and Veblen are professors in the Geography department at the University of Colorado Boulder. Hart is a professor in the department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin Madison.
The study focused primarily on forest recovery in Colorado's southern mountains. But in a telephone interview, Veblen said many of those findings are also relevant in Colorado's central and northern mountains.
Veblen noted that in the early 2000s, a mountain pine beetle outbreak that began in the 1990s attracted a lot of attention from politicians and some land managers.
Veblen said the ""initial, knee-jerk reaction"" was that the abundance of dead trees would lead to an increase in the probability of the outbreak and severity of wildfires.
Over the ensuing years, Veblen said that fear ""is not justified.""
The drive to ""do something"" about the outbreaks resulted in widespread logging to reduce the fire hazard. That wasn't really necessary.
What happened?
Veblen said that fire hazard depends in large part on ""fine fuels,"" including grasses and needles dropping from dead and dying trees. But putting more of those fuels on the ground has resulted in a decline in the probability of forest -consuming ""crown fires,"" in which fire jumps from treetop to treetop.
But Veblen added, dead and dying trees can make access to fire sites ""extremely hazardous,"" particularly in stands of lodgepole pine, the dominant species in this area.
By the 1990s, those stands of lodgepole pine were roughly 100 years old, the result of widespread fires in the middle of the 19th century. T rees that old were ripe for a beetle infestation.
Over the past 15 years or so, land managers have altered their thinking to concentrate more on what's called the wildland-urban interface -- zones where human development comes in contact with wildlands.
Veblen said at this point, the idea is to concentrate efforts in those areas, as well as roads and trails into the forests.
Paul Cada is the Vail Fire Department's wildland specialist. Vail has much of the valley's wildland urban interface. In a phone interview, Cada agreed that fire behavior has changed due to beetle infestations.
Evolving management
What's known about the post-beetle landscape has changed how land and forest managers view fires, and how to prepare for fires. The town is now in the final stages of drafting a community wildfire protection plan, and those changes will be incorporated.
""The goal is to prevent landscape-scale, high-severity events,"" Cada said. That approach includes letting some fires do their work. The challenge, Cada said, is to identify ways to contain fires to a relatively small area.
In a standard fire season, Cada said most fires are confined to small areas ranging from a single tree to less than an acre. That same season might see a few slightly larger fires of up to 15 acres. Larger fires usually require some kind of ""significant"" weather, say a dry winter followed by a hot summer.
To keep those fires small, measures near the wildland urban interface include forest thinning and creating openings in the forest canopy.
Outside of the lodgepole forests, there are a number of local aspen stands that are getting on the ""over mature"" side, Cada said, adding that those stands have been growing too long without being thinned by a naturally-occurring fire. In those cases, some prescribed burning could be useful.
Those fires mean land managers are picking the time, place and weather conditions that have the most benefit and lowest risk, Cada said. That particularly applies to interface areas.
Over the past 15 years or so, as the wildland interface has expanded, thinking about fire management has shifted.
The thinking a few years ago was ""control the vegetation and the problem goes away,"" Cada said. But large fires such as the Camp Fire in California revealed a different reality -- fire jumping from home to home, without much damage to surrounding vegetation.
The evolving management philosophy led town of Vail officials last year to pass revised building codes mandating more fire-resistant materials in new construction.
And ideas continue to shift about wildfire near populated areas.
""Almost monthly there's some new, groundbreaking research about building components or ways communities are engaging (around the interface),"" Cada said. That's why it's important for communities to stay as up to date as possible, he added.""
Back in the forest
While ideas about wildfire are changing, there's good news from the affected forests.
Veblen said at the beginning of the beetle outbreaks, land managers worried about long-term recovery. Those concerns turned out to be largely unfounded.
""Leave the forest along and it'll be fine,"" Veblen said.
But that doesn't mean the forest growing now will look like the one devastated by insects.
Veblen said land managers are seeing a good deal of species replacement in the natural new growth coming up through the dead trees.
Some lodgepole pine is being replaced by aspen and subalpine fir trees, he said. Spruce is popping up at higher elevations.
Current conditions provide land managers with some advice for the coming decades.
""Management should be aimed at efforts to improve recovery,"" Veblen said. ""You would want to create pre-outbreak conditions of small trees.""
But that regeneration may not be obvious at first glance.
""It may take 20 years or so for big lodgepole pines to fall over,"" Veblen said. ""But walk around in those forests, and recovery is well underway.""

Hanging Lake, a treasured national landmark in Glenwood Canyon, appears to have been spared after a major blowup of the Grizzly Creek fire late Thursday, the U.S. Forest Service said.
Early Friday, firefighters had not been able to determine the extent of the damage on the ground because of flames and smoke from the fire , which has been burning out of control since Monday and has grown to 19,440 acres.
""We know the fire moved through that area,"" the fire incident command team said in a statement Friday afternoon. ""We are working with Forest (Service) officials to assess to what extent Hanging Lake was impacted.""
After a flyover Friday evening, Scott Fitzwilliams, White River National Forest supervisor, said the flames had spared the vegetation on the lake cliffs and wooden walkways.
""However, the fire did burn intensely all around the area above it and to the sides of it,"" Fitzwilliams said during a Facebook Live update. ""We are not out of the woods but we're happy to report the main front and the most intense part of the fire did not seem to impact Hanging Lake in the immediate area.""
Hanging Lake is one of the most popular outdoor destinations in Colorado, accessible by a steep, rocky trail about a mile from Interstate 70. Before the trail was closed by the fire , reservations were required to try to protect the lake and trail from overuse.

Federal land managers in western Colorado received further bad news this week when a new report said ""above normal significant fire risk"" will extend through August this year.
Colorado and much of the West is currently facing a heat wave that is adding to the woes of longterm drought. Now, a Predictive Services team for federal agencies said little relief is expected from the monsoon this year, except in higher elevations of southwest Colorado. Therefore, the significant risk of wildfires is not expected to diminish until September.
The conditions prompted the White River National Forest to enact stage 1 fire restrictions, starting Friday, on its 2.3 million acres. The Bureau of Land Management also will enact stage 1 restrictions Friday for lands in Pitkin, Eagle and Garfield counties.
As part of the restrictions, campfires will be allowed only in metal grates at developed campgrounds. It will be illegal for backcountry travelers to pull into a favored site and start a fire in a stone fire ring. (See related story for other restrictions.)
White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams said Wednesday he is urging his full-time staff to take time off as soon as possible because the looming fire threat likely means a long, busy summer when no one can go on leave.
""All of us in the fire management world are nervous right now,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""In my almost 12 years here now, it's the worst I've ever seen it.""
Fitzwilliams said numerous factors weighed into the decision to go to stage 1 restrictions -- low fuel moisture content in vegetation, super dry soils that instantly absorb the precious little precipitation that is falling and the grim long-range forecast.
The White River enacted stage 1 restrictions on the same weekend this year as in June 2018, as the fire risk climbed. About three weeks later, the Lake Christine Fire broke out at the Basalt shooting range when target shooters illegally used tracer ammo.
Conditions are a little misleading now because vegetation has greened up and belie the extent of the drought. Fitzwilliams said it is ""not too weird"" to have dry June in the mountains, but one of the problems is the low soil moisture levels.
""Everybody I talk to, ranchers and everyone, I hear the same thing -- 'I've never seen it this dry,'"" Fitzwilliams said.
The U.S. Drought Monitor shows Eagle County is split between exceptional, extreme and severe droug ht.
In a June 11 article, the New York T imes compiled maps for early June over 21 years from the U.S.
Drought Monitor. Some level of drought isn't unusual for western Colorado.
However, the western part of the state has been in the grips of drought three out of the past four years and two consecutive. The only worse streak was 2002 through 2004.
Fitzwilliams said the challenge is ""getting people to understand this is the new normal.""
The combination of drought induced by climate change, decades of built-up fuels in national forests and the exploding growth in areas where forests meet civilization means wildfires will pose an ongoing threat, he said.

June 17, 2020  Montrose Daily Press, The (CO)  Katharhynn Heidelberg
Low moisture content in vegetation, coupled with high temperatures -- and, for the past several days, high wind -- is propelling fire conditions in the region to potentially dangerous levels.
Hot and dry conditions are typical for mid-June to mid-July, but, as wildfires rage in other parts of the state, it's a good time for people to be aware, and to be proactive against the risks, local experts said.
""This is our typical fire season,"" said Steve Ellis, the West Area Fire Management officer for the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control.
""In my 45 years, June 15 is kind of the highlight of our fire season, generally. This year, because we had such a dry spring, our conditions are probably a little higher than normal. With this wind and warm temperatures, it wouldn't take us very long for fuels to get to that extreme category.
""But right now, it is a typical June.""
Ellis said that in lower elevations (below 8,000 feet), conditions are typical, in that there isn't much moisture left in the soil, and as vegetation dries, it is ripe for fire spread.
Add dry lightning to the mix and wildland fires become more likely. Although the Steel Canyon Fire last month on the West End is suspected as human-caused, the East Canyon Fire now burning near Mancos was sparked by lightning, Ellis said.
That fire had exceeded 2,700 acres Tuesday, and also exceeded the capabilities of Montezuma and LaPlata counties' fire control. The blaze meets criteria for a state-responsibility fire, and the state Division of Fire Prevention and Control is now working with the Bureau of Land Management in tackling the fire, Ellis said.
""It's certainly dry and hot out there,"" said Jamie Gomez, executive director of the West Region Wildlife Council. ""... Late June is typically the peak of fire season in Colorado. We usually have pretty hot, dry and windy conditions.""
Usually, mid-July brings monsoonal weather patterns, but the last two weeks of June and the first two in July have traditionally seen the most fires, he said.
""All the vegetation is really low on fuel moisture, the amount of moisture in the plants,"" Gomez said.
The moisture content drops over the course of spring and into summer and is likely now at its lowest point. Those fuels are ""ready to burn,"" he said.
Mother Nature is not the only cause of wildfires. Although in Colorado, lightning is more often the
cause than human activity, unattended campfires, sparks from chainsaws and other equipment, and even a hot tailpipe of a vehicle parked in dry grass have caused fires.
""Either way, we're in that condition right now where any kind of spark out there has the potential to cause a wildfire,"" Gomez said -- plus, heat, dry air and wind propel the fires.
""We're definitely seeing those around the state, around the West. The more everyone can be doing ahead of the fire , the better those things will go,"" he said.
Prevention steps include the basics, like keeping a campfire small and making sure it is completely out before leaving camp; being extremely mindful when smoking outdoors, and being careful when parking vehicles, Ellis said.
So far, there are not many restrictions in Montrose, Delta and Ouray counties, and there are none on the Grand Mesa Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests, although fireworks are always prohibited on forest lands.
The BLM typically supports restrictions put in place by counties, or bases them on landscape conditions.
Fire restrictions and links to other information can be found at westslopefireinfo.com.
""I highly encourage everyone to enjoy being outside, but to all remember the Smokey Bear things we have learned,"" Ellis said.
Beyond taking steps to prevent fire, people living in the wildfire-prone areas can also do things to protect their homes and starve wildland blazes of fuel.
""This is a good time to be thinking about wildfire in your neighborhood, community and property, and things you can do to reduce wildfire risk,"" Gomez said.
T hrough grant funding, the wildfire council can conduct site visits to assess a property's specific risks and make recommendations for mitigation work.
""There's lots of things folks can be doing out there. We have the ability to meet with a homeowner on site to provide specific recommendations, which is often more helpful than a website or brochure can be,"" Gomez said.
Risk-reduction steps include hardening homes by removing the fuel sources that can ignite as wind or other fire activity propel hot embers -- the leading cause of home ignition during wildfires.
Home hardening includes creating defensible space around structures and by moving flammable material -- such as firewood -- at least 30 feet from homes.
Decks pose a considerable risk for spreading wildfires; the WRWC recommends enclosing them with metal or other non-combustible material so that embers cannot fly underneath them and ig nite.
Wooden fencing that runs right up to the home is another significant hazard, Gomez said. One recommendation is to remove the first 5 feet of fencing that is attached to the home and replace it with a section of non-combustible fencing.
Pay attention to landscaping material, such as wood chips or bark mulch, which should not be placed within 5 feet of the home, again, because of embers.
""The challenge is that every home and property is somewhat unique. There are usually some kind of unique situations in the way the home was built, situated, different trees and shrubs,"" Gomez said.

People who live in areas where development intersects with wildland (the wildland-urban interface) can visit cowildfire.org for more information about site visits, as well as cost-share programs.
Home hardening and community -scale projects, such as thinning, serve to reduce the intensity of future fires. A lower intensity fire can be managed more effectively, sometimes even in a beneficial way.
""Low intensity fires are less and less common, because we have more of a build-up of tree density and fuels than we pretty much ever had,"" Gomez said.
""That's the challenge we have. ... How can we address that issue knowing we have a considerable build-up of fuels, and every year, more and more people interested in living in our beautiful forests?""

June 26, 2021  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Mary Shinn
T hree consecutive years largely without monsoons, record-low soil moistures in the fall and below average winter snowpack have set the stage for the giant smoke plumes rising over Colorado this week.
""It's sad, sad when anything burns,"" said Bob Nock, owner of Eagle River Anglers, who's been watching the Sylvan fire blaze through thousands of acres this week about 16 miles south of Eagle in thick partially beetle-killed forest . While he sees the potential for the streams to be filled with silt and hurt the fish because of the fire , he sees the fire as a part of the natural cycle.
The Sylvan fire was one of seven large fires in the state this year that collectively have burned 26,114 acres as of Friday. The fires put the state way ahead of where it was last year at this time. The Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, which helps to coordinate firefighting across five states, upgraded its preparedness level to 3 this week which did not happen until Aug. 7 last year. The level reflects the number of fires and crews needed to fight them, said Larry Helmerick, a spokesman for the agency.
""We are definitely in fire season a lot earlier than we were last year,"" he said.
Rain on Thursday helped slow the fires, but they are expected to heat up again next week as conditions dry out.
As a potentially dry summer sets in, the state has been split by vastly different fire-danger conditions. Two back-to-back drought years have set the Western Slope up for an early and intense fire season while eastern Colorado made an unexpected recovery with a cold and wet May that has given rise to green slopes. The new, tall grasses could pose their own danger if hot temperatures dry them out in the coming months, experts say.
However, the conditions on the Western Slope and many part of the west are already reaching record drought levels. It's possible the coming wildfireseason could be worse than last year in the extreme conditions, said Jeff Colton, a warning coordination and incident meteorologist for the National Weather Service.
""The tundra up top is even crunchy,"" he said.
When the monsoon largely failed for the third year in a row on the Western Slope in 2020, the soils hit record low moisture levels and that dry soil soaked up the below average snowfall, hurting runoff, he said. Then last week, high temperatures hit in force with even Aspen hitting 90 degrees, he said. Humidity has also been extremely low, a contributor to fire risk.
""A lot of dead and down trees have some of the lowest fuel moisture content we have ever seen,"" he said.
In eastern Utah the vegetation is starting to disappear, similar to conditions seen in 2012 when the region saw blowing dust.
The Front Range and eastern Colorado, came out of drought entirely largely in the spring when storms came down from the north and largely missed the western part of the state, said Peter Goble, a climatologist with the Colorado Climate Center.
However, good conditions early in the season don't always last. The state's two largest fires in history, the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires which burned last year, caught fire after some of the best snowpack the year prior, he said. Both fires burned late in the season which is also unusual.
Monsoons in July and August have helped to reduce fire risk in the past, but now they are less consistent.
""We are definitely worried about what's going on,"" Goble said.
Widespread fire danger
While wildfire evacuations have been limited so far this month, the risk to homeowners is widespread because half of Colorado's residents live across the 3.2 million acres of the state where open space is adjacent to or intermingles with homes, also known as the wildland-urban interface, according to the state forest serve. Cedar Heights, Upper Skyway and Broadmoor Hill are a few of the neighborhoods that qualify in Colorado Springs.
By 2050, the area designated as wildland-urban interface is projected to grow to 9 million acres, the state forest service estimates.
The state legislature set aside one-time funding of $68 million earlier this year to help mitigate fire risk across the state and help areas burnt in last years large fire recover, said Sara Leonard, on behalf of the Division of Natural Resources. The Forest Restoration and Wildfire Risk Mitigation Grant Program to help neighborhood associations, governments and other groups with mitigation projects, such as thinning trees, also saw its annual budget grow from about $1 million to about $8 million.
This spring, the grant program received 85 applications for $13.6 million in assistance, according to a statement from the agency.
In Colorado Springs, where the fire departmenthelps run brush through wood chippers at neighborhood events, resident-led mitigation projects reached a peak last year compared to previous decades, Fire Marshal Brett Lacey said.
""We had our biggest chipping year in tonnage and participation that we have ever had since 2000,"" he said.
His office was nearly overwhelmed last year with on-site assessments thathelp determine what vegetation needs to be removed and this year the interest is staying high, he said. The fire
department works with about 140 homeowners associations, he said.
Mitigation work paid off most recently during the Bear Creek fire when 26 acres burned in November and came up to edge of yards in western Colorado Springs. But no homes, which officials credit in part to work to thin trees, shrubs and other vegetation across 76 acres in Bear Creek Park.
An unhealthy landscape
T hinning trees, removing brush and other fire mitigation strategies can help improve the longterm health of Colorado's forests.
As beetles have swept through Colorado forests killing millions of acres of trees and severe wildfires have followed, Colorado's forests may no longer be absorbing more carbon than they put out, said Amanda West Fordham, associate director of science and data with the state forest service. Carbon, also produced by cars, coal burning power plants and other manmade sources, contributes to climate change.
However, it is difficult to judge whether forests are emitting more carbon than they store because much of the carbon in a forest is stored in the ground, she said.
""A lot of researchers are trying to address how do we quantify these tradeoffs between what's emitted from wildfires versus what's being sequestered,"" West Fordham said.
Encouraging regeneration of forests after they burn through planting seedlings if entire stands of streets have been wiped out could be one of the ways the state encourages carbon sequestration and a return to good foresthealth, she said.
Not all fires are damaging, for example, a low intensity fire in pinyon juniper forest that leaves older trees in place can encourage new generations of seedlings and bolster foresthealth, she said.
Living with damaged forest
Sarah Metcalf-Burgard describes the level of beetle-killed forest near her home in Eagle County as extreme and she's been somewhat prepared for a blaze like the Sylvan fire , as part of a network of other horse-owners in the county who stay ready to help each other evacuate. Her ranch May Day Acres breeds horses.
While the network wasn't needed this week, she was still helping folks under pre-evacuation notices move livestock away from the fire, she said.
""It's definitely nerve wracking,"" she said.
She lives along Brush Creek and finds some comfort that the wetland might protecther property. But she is still worried if the watershed burns it will pollute the clear water of the trout-laden creek with runoff and fire suppressant.
Her family also worries fire could consume their century-old cabin on Forest Service land. The family cut back brush and watered down the surrounding landscape to protect it, Metcalf-Burgard said.
But she expressed optimism about weekend rain slowing down the fire and aiding crews working to contain it.
""It is looking hopeful right now,"" she said.

FIRE_UPDATES_FOR_SUNDAY_Glenwood_Canyon_not_safe__Post_Independent_Glenwood_Springs_CO___August_17_2020.txt,"FIRE UPDAT ES FO R SUNDAY: Gle nwo o d Canyo n 'no t safe - Po st Inde p e nde nt (Gle nwo o d Springs, CO ) August 17, 2020
Aug ust 17, 2020  Post Independent (Glenwood Spring s, CO)  Staff Report
UPDAT E 9 p.m. Sunday: Scott Fitzwilliams, White River National Forest Supervisor, addressed the burning question of the day during the Sunday evening Facebook live Grizzly Creek Fire community meeting -- when might I-70 in Glenwood Canyon reopen?
Fitzwilliams said that the ultimate decision is up to the Colorado Department of Transportation and Colorado State Patrol, but that before they even get to that point, the fire teams have to be sure there is no active fire along the highway and has to clear any debris from the fire, like burned trees and rocks, that may be on the roadway -- which could take awhile. As of Sunday, there was no estimated time for reopening.
""We all want it to open and we recognize this is a huge, huge impact to our communities, to the West Slope, to economies, to commerce, and it's a really, really high priority,"" Fitzwilliams said.
""Having been through that canyon quite a few times it's not safe right now, there's fire sometimes right up to the road, there are trees on fire right next to the road and there are firefighters and people moving up and down that need to do their jobs.""
Fitzwilliams also said the area immediately surrounding Hanging Lake still seems to be intact and that a Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team will start assessing the fire 's more longterm impact on forest resources like watersheds and wildlife this week.
UPDAT E 7:30 p.m. Sunday: This evening's video community meeting has a lot of good information about the status of the Grizzly Creek Fire .
UPDAT E 4:30 p.m. Sunday: Garfield County Public Health has issued new air quality information and resources.
New smoke outlook pages have been created for the Pine Gulch and Grizzly Creek fires that will be updated throughout the incident.
Air Advisory in Effect for Garfield County through Monday, Aug. 17. Air quality in Garfield County is projected to reach the 'unhealthy for sensitive groups'.
Public Health Recommendations: If smoke is thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain indoors. This is especially true for those with heart disease, respiratory illnesses, the very young, and the elderly. Consider limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present. Consider relocating temporarily if smoke is present indoors and is making you ill. If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy.
Outlook: Areas of moderate to heavy smoke have been observed Sunday across portions of
central and western Colorado due to the Pine Gulch and Grizzly Creek wildfires. Sunday afternoon saw wind at the fires out of a north to northwesterly direction. This could bring periods of moderate to heavy smoke for areas to the south and southeast of both wildfires, especially the Pine Gulch wildfire where the winds will be stronger. By late Sunday evening, smoke will begin to drain into lower lying areas surrounding both fires. This will bring longer duration, heavy smoke through early Monday morning to several drainages near the Pine Gulch wildfire including into the De Beque and Grand Junction areas. Meanwhile, heavy overnight smoke from the Grizzly Creek wildfire will impact locations along Interstate 70 in central and eastern Garfield County.
Resources:
Grizzly Creek Fire Smoke Page
Pine Gulch Fire Smoke Page
Garfield County Air Monitoring Web page.
State Air Quality Health Advisory page.
Low-Cost, community-based PurpleAir sensors along the I-70 corridor.
About PurpleAir:
Low-cost sensors, such as PurpleAir, can be used as an indicator of elevated levels of particulates in the air and help by adding data coverage in areas where there are not permanent regulatory monitors.
Public Health advises setting the default to a ""one day average"" rather than ""10-minute average"" because being exposed to moderate to heavy smoke for a short term period may not have the same health impacts as being exposed for a full 24 hours.
It is important to understand that these low-cost sensors are not considered accurate enough to be used in regulatory action. These sensors are not a reference method nor approved by EPA for compliance with federal air quality standards.UPDAT E 11:50 a.m. Sunday (official press release info):
Yesterday's Activity: Skies were clear early in the day as the inversion lifted causing higher temperatures and a more active fire. By mid-afternoon the fire on the north flank made a run from Grizzly Creek to Coffee Pot Road. The fire did spot across the road, but firefighters were able to catch it as the fuel types transitioned from timber to sage.
Spot fires from the previous night grew together and moved towards Bair Ranch. Dozer line around Bair Ranch and structure protection measures, were successful in holding back the fire resulting in no loss of structures. Fire on the southeast edge is holding just shy of Spruce ridge. Heavy smoke in late afternoon was due to the fire pushing between the Deadman canyon and Devil's Hole Canyon. The fire has moved to the canyon rim and is holding. Activity in the No Name area was quiet as the containment lines held and crews worked to bring in water with hose lays and
aerial water drops.
Today's Activity: Firefighters will continue implementing structure protection measures around the gondola at Adventure Park and will move north to T ransfer Trail with heavy equipment building indirect line. Crews will work to keep fire south of Coffee Pot Road by constructing and reinforcing control lines. Crews will engage the fire where they safely can. Direct attack of the fire has been difficult due to the rugged and steep terrain. Firefighters will hold and improve line construction as fire comes out of deep canyons. At this time the fire is held up on Spruce Ridge, however, there are stringers of heavy timber that are concerning. Contingency line to the east will be implemented by heavy equipment. Today heavy air tankers will be shared with the Pine Gulch Fire.
Daily operations video updates will be posted on the Grizzly Creek Fire Facebook page. There will also be another Facebook live community meeting at 6 p.m. Sunday for fire managers to provide updates and answer questions via the chat function.
Maps and other information will also be posted on inciweb.
Evacuations: Visit the Garfield County website and Eagle County, as well as on official FaceBook accounts.
Area Closures: BLM recreation sites and boat ramps on the southern portion of the Colorado River Road (RD 301) near Dotsero, Colorado. Specifically, Cottonwood Landing boat ramp, Lyons campground and boat ramp, and Dotsero boat ramp.
Fire Restrictions: Stage 2 Fire Restrictions are in place for all jurisdictions. https://colorado.gov/pacific/dfpc/fire-restriction-information
Road Closures: I-70 continues to be closed between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum, with no estimated time for reopening. Forest Service Road 400, Eagle-Thomasville Road, is closed due to excessive traffic and accidents resulting from drivers attempting to use this primarily dirt road as an alternate to the I-70 closure. Cottonwood Pass Road in Garfield and Eagle counties. Coffee Pot Road, T ransfer Trail and Clinetop Mesa roads and areas of the Flattops accessed by those roads are also closed, as well as many surrounding White River National Forest and BLM roads. For more information regarding road closures: www.cotrip.orgUPDAT E 11 a.m. Sunday: Firefighters are continuing to implement structure protection measures around the gondola at the Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park today, according to a morning update from Grizzly Creek Fire incident command.
That activity is to move north to T ransfer Trail, involving heavy equipment building indirect line.
The fire grew to 25,690 acres on Saturday, burning mostly on the eastern and southeastern flanks.
""Crews will also work to keep the fire south of Coffee Pot Road by constructing and reinforcing control lines,"" according to the latest update. ""Crews will continue engaging the fire where they safely can. Direct attack has been difficult due to the rugged and steep terrain.
Here is the latest fire area map from fire officials: Regular updates are available on Inciweb and at the Grizzly Creek Fire Facebook page. This is a developing story and will be updated.

Amid escalating worries about climate change and pollution from oil and gas operations, Colorado's
largest electric utility is going to buy natural gas from a company that is continuously monitoring its
emissions and working to certify its product as responsible.
Xcel Energy said Wednesday that it will buy some of its gas for use in Colorado from Denver-based
Crestone Peak Resources as part of a pilot project to show that it's dedicated to delivering ""a cleaner
energy product."" Xcel was the first utility in the country to announce a goal of delivering carbon-free
electricity.
The utility's latest announcement comes as Colorado continues to tighten regulations to cut emissions of
methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and pollutants from oil and gas, transportation and other activities
that have put a large portion of the Front Range out of compliance with federal air-quality standards.
The decision by Xcel also comes as the public and investors are pressuring the oil and gas industry and
energy suppliers to be more environmentally responsible. Companies' performance in ESG -environmental, social and corporate governance -- is being scrutinized along with revenue and free cash
flow.
Crestone is working with Project Canary, a Denver-based company, to deploy 24/7 monitoring of its oil
and gas sites in Weld, Arapahoe and Adams counties. Project Canary provides the monitoring
technology and works with the Payne Institute for Public Policy at the Colorado School of Mines, which
collects the data to provide an independent analysis of the information.
""We saw where the air quality standards and where the regulations were going and what was going to be
required of companies to operate in Colorado. As a leader in this space we wanted to continue to lead,""
said Jason Oates, Crestone's vice president of government affairs.
The intent is to produce ""some of the cleanest molecules"" anywhere, Oates said.
Jeremy Nichols, climate and energy program director for the environmental group WildEarth Guardians,
said continuous monitoring of emissions instead of just periodic inspections can provide a sense of
what's happening at well sites. The sites typically include multiple wells, tanks and other equipment.
However, Nichols voiced concern about efforts by companies to brand their oil and gas as responsibly
produced. Oil and natural gas emit greenhouse gases no matter how cleanly they're produced, he said.
""Reducing methane leaks, ensuring compliance with clean air rules and regulations, that's all well and
good,"" Nichols added. ""But ultimately, we need to find ways to transition, to learn to live without oil and
gas.""
Colorado's oil and gas regulations are considered among the strongest in the nation. The rules have
been revised through the years and in 2019 a state law mandated a sweeping overhaul of the
regulations, including earlier and more frequent monitoring of emissions.
In 2014, Colorado became the first state to approve methane regulations, which were used as a model
for the Obama administration's rules. The Trump administration rolled the rules back, but Congress is
considering reviving them.
Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a key focus in the battle against climate change. In the
short term, it is 84 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. The gas is released through
leaks or releases from equipment or produced when natural gas is burned as waste at oil wells.
""I think that it's beyond reasonable to dispute that fossil fuels are going to be with us for the immediate
future. As we all move toward a cleaner economy, we need to understand that in this interim we need to
make sure that the fossil fuel supply chain is as clean as it can be,"" said Dan Grossman, senior director
of regulatory and legislative affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund.
Grossman said initiatives such as Crestone's are positive and might be a good model, but voluntary
measures aren't a substitute for regulations.
""That's why it's so critical that the Biden administration moves quickly and boldly on methane regulations
and states like Colorado continually improve their own regulations,"" Grossman said.
Crestone has caught leaks and other problems much more quickly, thanks to its continuous monitoring,
said Taryn Weiner, the air quality supervisor for the company. She said the sensors have identified
seven incidents over 17 months that warranted action.
Justin Blohm, an environmental consultant, along with Crestone employees, gets all the alerts and
alarms. Some are the result of maintenance work. Information about wind direction and other
meteorological data can help determine whether a spike in emissions is from the site or blowing in from
somewhere else.
During a demonstration at a Crestone well pad near Firestone, Blohm pointed out the small jump on his
computer screen after someone opened a propane bottle around a sensor.
""Those canaries sense every second of every day, and it's uploaded to the cloud once a minute,"" said
Canary Project co-founder and CEO Chris Romer, referring to the sensors.
Besides methane, the devices monitor volatile organic compounds, which include toluene and benzene,
known to cause cancer. The chemicals contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, or smog,
which can cause or aggravate respiratory problems. The sensors also monitor levels of particulate
matter, which causes hazy air.
Romer said Project Canary has its devices on more than 100 well pads in major oil and gas fields in
Texas, North Dakota and other states. The company works with operators through its TrustWell program
to certify that well construction meets certain standards and that operations haven't harmed the air, water
or surrounding communities.
A company that can show its natural gas or oil was produced responsibly likely will have a competitive
edge, said Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute. He pointed to a decision last year by Engie, a
French utility, to halt negotiations on a multibillion-dollar deal to import liquified natural gas from the U.S.
Although Engie hasn't explained publicly why it scuttled the deal, Bazilian said he believes there were
political and environmental concerns, such as the impact of methane emissions.
He said the gas was called too dirty.
""I think that sent ripples through the industries: the operators, the people in the oil and gas industry as
well as the finance community,"" said Bazilian, formerly the lead energy specialist at the World Bank.
The Payne Institute is going through the initial phases of pulling together Crestone's data. The company
is working to have Project Canary recognized as a state-approved monitoring method so it can share its
data with regulators, Oates said.
""We know that natural gas and fossil fuels are slowly being replaced by other forms of energy, but we
need to have an organized and efficient transition. You want to use the cleanest forms (of energy) when
you're doing that,"" said John Schmidt, Crestone's vice president of operations. ""We want to basically be
the last spigot turned off when we're off fossil fuels.""

flexibility in reconstruction But while several of the proje.txt,"flexibility in reconstruction. But while several of the projects that were denied reimbursement in Boulder
County under the old standards are being reexamined  including a $600,000 request for the Bear
Canyon Trail  NCAR Road project  the new guidelines were just released in September and the
appeals process has been slow to make sense of the new rules.
""The goal in working with Boulder County is to make sure that they are receiving the most amount of
funding possible using the new rules in the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018,"" FEMA
spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough. ""It's just going to take some time.""
By requiring the U.S. Government Accountability Office to issue a report every five years on how FEMA
considers climate resiliency, including an economic analysis of the benefits that prioritizing resiliency in
new and rebuilt infrastructure will afford, as well as an analysis of the number of structures that were not
destroyed in a disaster due to pre-disaster planning, the Climate Resilient Communities Act would ideally
provide a factual basis for FEMA to approve more site-specific recovery plans without the local
governments such as Boulder and Boulder County having to go through the complex appeals process.
""We are introducing the Climate Resilient Communities Act, bipartisan legislation to provide a pathway
for FEMA to factor in climate impacts and risks into building codes and standards to ensure that our
communities are climate-resilient and equipped for the future,"" Neguse wrote in a statement.
Ironically, the model for this kind of reform took shape just 15 miles to the northeast of Boulder, in
Longmont.
Following the 2013 floods, instead of going through the normal channels, Longmont applied for
reimbursement through a FEMA pilot project called Public Assistance Alternatives Procedures, also
known as PAAPs.In doing so, Longmont was able to identify a total dollar figure for all of the damage
caused by the 2013 floods and work with FEMA representatives to create site-specific plans for the
same cost.
Much of the $29 million that FEMA granted Longmont by way PAAP was spent on the Resilient St. Vrain
Project, which focused funding on upstream channel improvements rather than repairing the ponds at
Sandstone Ranch Community Park, and redesigning the Main Street and South Pratt Parkway bridges
so that they can withstand 100-year flood flows.
""It's not how do we just rebuild, but how do we rebuild towards resiliency that will protect us in the future,""
said Nick Wolfrum, a senior project engineer with Longmont Public Works and Natural Resources. ""The
St. Vrain channel will now definitely protect from future floods, yet still provide us with environmental

Forest Service continues logging work around Peak 7 to reduc.txt,"Forest Service continues logging work around Peak 7 to reduce
wildfire fuels

The Colorado State Forest Service and the U.S. Forest Service are working together to continue logging
operations to reduce the risk of wildfire near the Peak 7 community.
Phase 2 of the project will span 97 acres across the White River National Forest around the Peak 7
neighborhood. Contractors will use mechanized forestry equipment and handheld chain saws to
complete the project starting this summer.
The first phase of the project was completed in fall 2020, reducing fuels on slopes near Blue Ridge Road.
The project is intended to reduce the volume and connectivity of fuels to reduce wildfire hazards to the
adjacent neighborhood and the greater Breckenridge community.
All operations will take place from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays, and intermittent traffic interruptions can
be expected due to logging trucks along neighborhood roads. Temporary trail closures are also expected
because the project briefly crosses the Peaks Trail, among others.
The project adheres to the 2011 Breckenridge Forest Health and Fuels Environment Assessment and
design criteria, which were reevaluated in 2020.
District Ranger Adam Bianchi said when the project was initially planned, some local residents pushed
back because they did not want to remove trees in the area. Bianchi said the project was put on pause
until the Peak 2 fire, when residents grew more concerned about wildfiresafety.
Bianchi said 80% of the work will be clear-cutting, and the other 20% will be cutting, hand piling and
burning later on.
""The whole purpose of the work really is to remove all of the standing dead and down material,"" Bianchi
said. ""We try to leave pockets of green where there's healthy trees still, trying to leave as much diversity
as we can.""
He said the focus is on lodgepole pines because they are the trees still feeling the effects of the mountain
pine beetle epidemic that started to come to an end around 2012. There is a lot of dead material that has
had time to cure over the years making it more susceptible to fire.
Bianchi also emphasized that the project is a collaboration with the state forest service and Summit
County, through what is called the Good Neighbor Authority. This partnership allowed work to be done on
public and private property.
""It's now become kind of a cross-boundary, multipartnership project in order to get in there and help
make that neighborhood more defensible to fire,"" Bianchi said.
A map of the project outlines 12 areas where logging work will take place, highlighting the specific work
intended for each area.
In some areas, trees will be clear-cut. In others, dead trees will be removed with patches of healthy trees
left in place. Trees that are hand cut will be stored on-site to be burned at a later date.
Residents and visitors are encouraged to avoid the work areas and heavy equipment due to risk of injury
around falling trees. It is recommended to stay at least 500 feet away from all project equipment.
The Forest Service intends to continue work throughout the winter season, but should snow levels
prevent access, the project will resume in summer 2022.

The total number of trees Gretchen Fitzgerald has helped plant in the San Juan National Forest during her time as a forester for the U.S. Forest Service topped out at 2,183,557.
""Reforesting areas that used to be forest and bringing that back, it felt like the right thing to do,"" Fitzgerald said. ""My part was one little part of that whole picture.""
Fitzgerald started as a forester with the Forest Service in 1998, but it wasn't until around 2008 that she started to lead reforestation projects throughout Southwest Colorado.
During her time, she helped facilitate the replanting of more than 2 million trees across 5,500 acres, focusing on areas such as the burn scar on Missionary Ridge and old clear-cutting zones around Wolf Creek Pass.
Recently, Fitzgerald decided it was time for the next adventure, taking a job as the ecosystem staff officer with the Sequoia National Forest in California. Still, her legacy, which can be seen across the landscape, will live on.
""Gretchen worked on the San Juan for over 20 years, and during that time facilitated the planting of millions of trees,"" said Kara Chadwick, San Juan National Forest supervisor.
""Equally important, however, are the contributions that Gretchen made in the agency and in local communities, bringing people together in the spirit of learning and helping to restore health and resilience to the SJNF,"" Chadwick said.
Forester who planted 2 million trees uproots for next adventure
Fitzgerald grew up in Bayfield after her parents, Jim and T erri, decided to move West and settled in Southwest Colorado in the 1970s, with her dad taking a job at Fort Lewis College teaching Spanish.
There, with the HD Mountains looming overhead, Fitzgerald spent a lot of time playing in the woods, developing a love of nature. So when she went to college, she majored in wildlife biology, naturally.
But over time, Fitzgerald realized wildlife biologists tend to deal with more analyses and paperwork. What she wanted to do was work in the field and get projects done. So she went back to school and gother masters in forestry.
""I felt like I should do something for climate change,"" she said.
T rees have had a tough go of it during the past few decades in the San Juan National Forest . They are under pressure from massive wildfires, a spruce beetle outbreak and prolonged drought.
Forester who planted 2 million trees uproots for next adventure
At the time Fitzgerald launched her career, there wasn't a huge emphasis on reforestation projects. But around 2008, Fitzgerald was exposed to her first replanting project, led by the Bureau of Land Management, and it clicked.
""I thought, 'This makes so much sense, why aren't we doing this?"" she said. ""We should be doing more reforestation, and I can make this happen.""
Indeed, Fitzgerald got to work.
The first replanting happened near Vallecito, up Middle Mountain Road, where a fire impacted the area around Bear Creek. Then, around 2010, she focused projects around the burn scar of Missionary Ridge.
Her projects spread all around  above Lemon Reservoir, swaths across Missionary Ridge from Vallecito to Durango, Wolf Creek Pass and over to parts of the upper Hermosa Creek.
""I did a lot of experimenting to get the best survival I could,"" she said. ""If I had a failure, I'd figure out why and try something new. I had different challenges to give myself to figure out the best ways to plant trees in the San Juans.""
To be sure, replanting forests is not an exact science and an ever-evolving field. Fitzgerald, for instance, quickly learned that seedlings from Wolf Creek Pass did not do as well when used on Missionary Ridge, despite the relative proximity.
And Fitzgerald became even more ambitious as the years wore on. In 2019, for example, she led a project that replanted trees on old mine waste rock piles at an abandoned mine site near Silverton.
Leading the effort to restore impacted forests, mostly in areas that are not showing signs of natural regeneration, has created a unique bond for Fitzgerald to the landscape around Southwest Colorado.
""I love going back and visiting them,"" she said. ""I can remember when we planted it (and) watch it g row.""
Forester who planted 2 million trees uproots for next adventure
Recently, Fitzgerald said she decided it was time for a new challenge, taking a job on the Sequoia National Forest , which takes her more out of the field and into the office directing all sorts of divisions  wildlife, hydrology, range, timber.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, her move to California was delayed, but is likely to happen this summer. She said she's excited for the whole new host of issues a new forest brings, especially one with 3,000-year-old trees.
""There's a little nostalgia for sure,"" she said. ""But I feel like I did a good job and it's time for
someone else to take the reins.""

The Cameron Peak Fire closed additional sections of the Roosevelt National Forest on Thursday as incident commanders looked at weather, terrain and the possibilities for fire growth.
""I know this is huge and there were a lot of folks hoping to get out into the woods this weekend, particularly with hunting plans, but we really did this to home in on the value of life and public safety that's so important to us,"" said Katie Donahue, Canyon Lakes district ranger.
The fire burning in the Poudre Canyon west of Fort Collins grew to 16,461 acres, though incident commanders said fire activity was less Thursday than on previous days due to the weather.
And a team of 646 firefighters attacked the blaze, creating fire breaks where they might be most successful at stopping the fire and protecting homes, not directly on the line but in the possible future path. Crews are attacking the fire both on the ground and in the air with 10 helicopters.
""Our firefighters are working hard and diligently to keep this fire as small as possible,"" Jared Hohn, deputy incident commander, said in an online fire briefing.
While the fire is at zero containment, meaning that crews cannot say for sure it will not grow past the set fire breaks that teams are building, they have completed about 30% of the fire lines on the ground. A fire line is where crews remove vegetation and use natural features to build a barrier to stop the blaze from spreading.
""Right now, we're at 0% contained on the fire, but that does not mean our firefighters aren't doing good work,"" Hohn said. ""There's a difference between containment and completion of line.""
Some rain that fell on the north and east side of the fire on Wednesday helped lessen the spread of the fire, and a boost in humidity on Thursday also resulted in a much less active fire, said Darren Clabo, a meteorologist with the fire management team.
""Most of the fire activity was in the southwest (Thursday) in the higher country on the west side of the fire,"" Clabo said. ""The entire fire showed less activity (Thursday) than it did in previous days, likely due to an increase in relative humidity.""
However, warmer temperatures, higher winds and less humidity -- extreme fire weather -- are in the forecast for Friday and over the weekend, Clabo said.
The Poudre Canyon Road is closed from Rustic to Kelly Flats, portions of Rocky Mountain National Park are closed, and now a wider section of the national forest is closed to help with firefighting efforts and the potential need for future evacuations if the fire grows, officials said.
The closure includes areas:
* West of County Roads 67J, 69, 63E and 27.
* East of the Colorado State Forest State Park; south of County Road 80 C.
* North of Rocky Mountain National Park and County Road 44H.
* Colo. 14 was closed Thursday night at Kelly Flats, not due to fire activity, but to allow larger vehicles a better place to turn around before Rustic.
""I absolutely get it, this is inconvenient,"" said Donahue. ""I also understand the timing for folks in the community, but I just want to reassure you that this is about safety. It's not necessarily directly related to the behavior of the fire ... It's just us trying to get ahead of expected use for the weekend and this potential this fire has.""

Forest_restoration_project_could_bolster_timber__Durango_Herald_The_CO___January_10_2020.txt,"Fo re st re sto ratio n p ro je ct co uld bo lste r timbe r - Durango He rald, The (CO ) - January 10, 2020

A new project to improve the health of 750,000 acres of forest in Southwest Colorado could open new opportunities for the timber industry to harvest more wood and use it in nontraditional ways.
The Rocky Mountain Restoration Initiative is projected to cost $50 million to mitigate wildfire risk and improve the health of the ecosystem through prescribed burning, forest thinning, logging and other strategies, said Reid Armstrong, communications project manager for the initiative. The project could receive funding through grants, nonprofit fundraising, the operating funds of governmental agencies and nonprofits, among other sources, she said.
Decades of fire suppression have left the forests across Southwest Colorado and much of the West overgrown and susceptible to catastrophic wildfires and beetles that can kill vast numbers of trees. The project is expected to include all the vegetation on the landscape, including species that aren't necessarily a focus of mitigation, such as aspen, she said.
The initiative, a collaboration of 30 organizations, is expected to work across public, state and private land over 10 years to improve the resiliency of forest along the U.S. Highway 160 corridor east and west of Durango.
Businesses will be valuable partners in the initiative and could help come up with a model for using the wood harvested from the forest that could be economically sustainable long term, said Ellen Roberts, a former state senator and a member of the initiative's steering committing.
Forest restoration project could bolster timber industry
How to make forest thinning economically sustainable is ""the big question in the entire western U.S. Everybody is trying to figure it out,"" she said.
But Southwest Colorado is already using timber typically considered worthless in innovative ways, and she expects more small businesses could help lead the charge to find new uses for challenging timber, particularly trees and branches that are 10 inches in diameter or less and don't have commercial value in traditional markets, she said.
If the area can find a way to manufacture products from the small-diameter timber, it could help inform how forests are managed across the state, Armstrong said.
Southwest Colorado was chosen as the focus for the initiative in part because some small businesses are already pursuing creative solutions.
J.R. Ford, owner of several timber businesses in Pagosa Springs, is building a facility to produce biochar, a product made from timber burned at very low temperatures that can be used as a soil amendment. The biochar is extremely porous, so it can absorb water and release it slowly and improve the natural biome in the soil.
""It creates housing and home condo projects for microbes,"" he said.
The biochar can be made out of small-diameter timber and branches that still have their needles attached.
Forest restoration project could bolster timber industry
Ford said he expects to break ground on the new facility that will make charcoal briquettes and biochar this year. The plant could be making biochar by the end of the year.
The large stands of beetle-killed trees in Colorado also pose a challenge because the timber is traditionally considered trash by the timber industry, said David Sitton, co-owner of Aspen Wood Products and Aspen Wall Wood in Montezuma County.
However, companies in Southwest Colorado are using it as decorative paneling and crosslaminated timber, a form of manufactured wood panels made by gluing three layers of wood, with the layers oriented perpendicular to adjacent layers, Roberts said.
Aspen Wall Wood produces decorative paneling from the timber and ships it nationally and internationally, Sitton said. The combination of tree species dying and the type of beetle causing the deaths in this area produce a particularly desirable blue stain that has proved marketable, he said.
If the Forest Service stays committed to timber sales, he expects the industry will grow in the area.
Forest restoration project could bolster timber industry
""I would suspect that there will be competition and interest,"" he said.
Kyle Hanson and Andy Hawk, owners of T imber Age Systems, are working on building a local market for cross-laminated timber they plan to manufacture, which is typically used in commercial buildings. But they expect the best local use for it will be in residential homes, they said.
The growth of the timber industry could also support more jobs, such as foresters, truck drivers, heavy equipment operators, electricians and other positions requiring special training, Roberts said. She has started talking with local high schools and Pueblo Community College about what they would need to help prepare students for those roles. Preparing skilled labor is particularly important since many in the timber industry are approaching retirement age, she said.
""We're at the beginning of pulling the partners together and integrating seamless pathways for young people to seek careers in the Southwest,"" she said.

The Colorado State Forest Service will begin accepting proposals from local governments, fire protection districts, community groups and homeowners associations, ultimately awarding $700,000 for projects to improve foresthealth and reduce wildfire risk.
""The state can fund up to 50 or 75 percent of the cost of each awarded project; grant recipients are required to match at least 25 or 50 percent of the total project cost through cash or in-kind contributions depending on whether the project location falls within an area of 'fewer economic resources,"" the Forest Service announced.
Colorado's Forest Restoration and Wildfire Risk Mitigation Grant Program will give preference to projects that are implemented across landowner boundaries, are located within a priority area, or involve forest treatment that protects water supplies. While the money can support forest restoration, it may not be used to rehabilitate forest land following wildfires.
The announcement follows an unusually destructive fire season, with the Cameron Peak Fire being the largest in Colorado's history with smoke and ash drifting to the Denver Metro area on multiple occasions. As of Wednesday, The Denver Channel reported that the Cameron Peak blaze was 92% contained.
Applications are due to Forest Service field offices by Dec. 11. Individual grants are worth up to $250,000.

The current conditions for the pile burns are favorable following significant snowfall and colder weather over the weekend, according to the Forest Service.
Piles will be allowed to burn and smolder overnight unattended, and fire management personnel will be on scene during the day to monitor fuel consumption and potential smoke impacts.

A proposal to try to revive aspen stands across 375,000 acres of the White River National Forest has drawn criticism from environmentalists, endorsements from some local governments and concerns from spelunkers.
The U.S. Forest Service wants to use prescribes fires and timber harvests to improve the health in areas where aspen forests are in decline. The agency said aspen trees have a strong presence on about 600,000 of the 2.3 million acres of the White River forest , which stretches from Independence Pass to the Flat Tops and from Rifle to Summit County. The Forest Service identified about 375,000 acres as in need of enhanced management because of factors such as drought, disease, pests and the age of trees. In addition, conifer trees are invading some aspen stands.
""Under natural conditions, wildfire would play an important role in reinitiating aspen forests on those sites,"" the Forest Service proposal said. ""However, fire suppression over the past few decades has likely resulted in a greater amount of conifer and a lesser amount of aspen across the White River National Forest .""
The proposed management would involve targeting about 10,000 acres per decade through prescribed fires and another 10,000 acres per decade through timber harvests. However, the plan does not identify specific areas or prioritize where the work would occur first. That's a point of contention with environmental groups. They say the public deserves a chance to comment on a case-by-case basis.
The town of Vail endorsed the project but said a more aggressive approach is needed to have an impact.
""The scale of this project does not match the rapid change in condition of the forest 's aspen stands,"" the town government said in comments submitted to the Forest Service. ""At this scale it would take 18 decades to treat all the potential stands identified in this proposed action. We would ask that you consider increasing the maximum allowable acres to levels that would appropriately address the identified need.""
The project was also endorsed by the county commissioners of Summit and Rio Blanco counties.
Rocky Smith, a longtime environmental advocate and researcher, presented an opposite view. He said targeting 20,000 acres of aspen stands for management per decade is not warranted because nature will achieve the same results.
""With about 50 percent of the White River National Forest 's aspen being stable and a likelihood of increasing fire that will cause some aspen stands to regenerate, large-scale treatment is a waste of money and other resources,"" Smith wrote. ""We recommend the project be dropped or considerably downsized to treating local areas where aspen clones appear to be dying out.""
His comments were endorsed by multiple environmental organizations, including Aspen-based EcoFlight, Colorado Wild and Durango-based Great Old Broads for Wilderness.
The Roaring Fork Valley's oldest homegrown environmental advocacy group, Wilderness Workshop, submitted form letters from 275 individuals. The letter raised three points: First, the agency must analyze the impacts of the project on climate ; second, that the proposal doesn't follow the National Environmental Policy Act because it doesn't specify areas to be managed or give the public the chance to comment on specific portions of the project; and third, that temporary roads could alter the character of roadless areas and management techniques could affects areas with caves and karsts.
""This proposed project is too large and too impactful, to move forward at this time,"" the letters said. ""The White River National Forest should shelve or significantly revise this project.""
Wilderness Workshop also teamed with the Center for Biological Diversity and The Wilderness Society to submit 10 pages of detailed comments. In contrast to Vail saying 20,000 acres of treatment per decade was too little, the environmental groups said it is too much.
""The project would authorize harvesting and burning 20,000 acres -- more than 30 square miles -- of aspen trees per decade, as well as road construction and reconstruction activities.""
The Forest Service received 31 comments during the official comment period, many of them endorsed by multiple individuals or organizations.
The fight is on
What's the issue? The White River National Forest wants to undertake prescribed burns and timber harvests on 375,000 acres to improve the health of aspen stands.
What's the beef? Proponents say the pace of the project is too slow. The U.S. Forest Service is proposing treatment on 20,000 acres per decade. Environmentalists question the need for the project based on effects on climate and creation of roads. They also contend the Forest Service is violating rules by not specifically identifying where the work would occur.
What's next? The White River staff is analyzing public comments and undertaking environmental analysis for a draft Environmental Assessment. The EA could be released for public review in the fall.
Details: The proposal and public comments can be viewed at https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/? project=59419
Several individuals expressed concern about the effects of prescribes burns and timber harvests on caves, the bats that occupy them and karsts formed in limestone in part of the forest .
The White River National Forest staff is in the process of analyzing comments as part of its environmental review, David Boyd, the Forest 's public information officer said Thursday.
""The next step we anticipate is an Environmental Assessment with a draft decision, which would be published for a 45-day objection period,"" he said.
Changes could be made to the plan based on the comments and environmental analysis, Boyd said. Identifying 20,000 acres per decade for treatment is a starting point that could be altered, he said.
There is no firm deadline for the release of the draft EA but it could come as early this fall, according to Boyd.

The Colorado State Forest Service is encouraging property owners to begin fire mitigation work, including tree pruning, which is best done in the late winter and early spring.
According to CSFS, pruning trees before the late spring and summer helps keep trees healthy and encourages new growth. Pruning also reduces available fuels for wildfires.
""Pruning trees during the late dormant season maximizes growth and allows the tree owner to spot problem areas and build strong structure for the long term,"" said Kamie Long, supervisory forester for the CSFS.
Once flower buds or new leaves start to expand, pruning should wait until the next year. Torn, broken or dead branches, such as those that may have been damaged in the recent snowstorm, can be removed at any time of year.
The CSFS adds that it's important to not over prune and focus on pruning branches that are rubbing, dangling on the ground or causing structural issues. For more pruning tips, go to csfs.colostate.edu.
If a job requires running a chainsaw over your head or removing large branches or entire trees, Long said it is best to contact an insured, ISA Certified Arborist, which can be found at www.isaarbor.com.
CSFS also suggests mulching or chipping pruned branches. More information about Grand County's chipping options can be found at BeWildfireReady.org.

BRECKENRIDGE -- The U.S. Forest Service is working on a fire mitigation project near the Peak 7 neighborhood that involves clear-cutting about 47 acres to protect the neighborhood and surrounding areas from potential wildfires.
Representatives from the Colorado State Forest Service, Summit County Open Space and Trails, and the Red, White & Blue Fire Protection District presented on the health of the Upper Blue River Basin forest area at the Breckenridge Town Council work session Tuesday, Feb. 11.
Ashley Garrison, a forester with the state Forest Service, said trees under 5 inches in diameter are being left, and she reported that 10 acres already have been cleared. The remainder of the project is on hold until the snow melts, Garrison said. There will not be pile burning as a result of the clearing because the contractor is taking the wood out to be repurposed.
Other upcoming fuels reduction projects include one near Wellington neighborhood, which will include 91 acres, Garrison said. The project will be put out to bid in early spring.
And the Forest Service is seeking public comment on another logging project near Breckenridge that includes 522 acres. The project already has been approved following the 2011 Breckenridge Forest Health and Fuels project analysis with the caveat that the forest -- which includes areas around Peak 7, White Cloud, Golden Horseshoe and Blue River -- is at 60% mortality.
Dillon District Ranger Bill Jackson said the mortality in these areas ranges from 20% to 55%, but the Forest Service wants to go back out and make a new decision about whether the project can move forward sooner than when the 60% threshold is reached.
""Public sentiment has changed so much since 2011,"" Jackson said. ""They want us in there tomorrow creating these fuel breaks.""
How To Comment
Peak 7 fuels reduction project comment deadline: March 13
* Mail written comments to Bill Jackson, District Ranger, c/o Eric White, P.O. Box 620, Silverthorne, Colorado 80498-0620
* Hand-deliver written comments to the Dillon Ranger District office, 680 Blue River Parkway, Silverthorne, which is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mondays through Fridays
* Fax written comments to 970-468-7735
* Submit written comments electronically at Cara.Ecosystemmanag ement.org /public/commentinput?project=57 601
Jackson said that in 2019, his office received more than 300 letters of support from Peak 7 residents asking for fuels reduction work in the area.
""In a nutshell, how are we doing?"" council member Jeffrey Bergeron asked during the meeting, bringing up the possibility of a fire like that in Paradise, California. ""Are we limited by finances or are we doing everything we can to keep our community safe?""
""I think a Paradise situation could definitely happen, but we're working to link everything up and make as robust of a fuel system as we can,"" Garrison said. ""I think there's a lot of work to do, but a lot of the low-hanging fruit has been picked.""
Red, White & Blue fire Capt. Matt Benedict added insight to the possibility of wildfires.
""We know as a fire department we're going to ebb and flow,"" Benedict said, noting that while the wildflowers are beautiful, they provide a lot of fuel. ""After a wet year, there's a lot of grass and wildflowers. ... That biomass is still sitting there.""
He also noted that the county is about 14 years past the mountain pine beetle epidemic and that the fire department was told that 10 years would be the trigger point for fires. That prediction proved accurate with the Peak 2 and Buffalo Mountain fires occurring in the past few years.
""The fuels are going to get more challenging to treat the longer we wait,"" Benedict said to council members. ""So from a fire district, we challenge you guys to take a good honest look at everyone's open space.""

The four largest wildfires burning in Colorado have cost upwards of $77 million to fight, with more than 206,000 acres burned as of Monday morning.
But despite cooler weather over the past weekend thathelped firefighters make progress toward containment, there's still a long way to go before the fire season's tab will close out.
Breaking it down by fire, with data from the National Interagency Fire Center's Incident Management Situation Report released Monday:
* The Pine Gulch fire, north of Grand Junction, has burned 139,007 acres, is 79% contained and has cost $28 million, making it Colorado's most expensive fire of the year. It's also the largest recorded wildfire in Colorado history.
* The Grizzly Creek fire, east of Glenwood Springs, is close behind financially, at $25.5 million. It has burned 32,464 acres and is 73% contained.
* The Cameron Peak fire, west of Fort Collins, has cost $16.1 million. The 23,002 acre fire is 0% contained.
* The Williams Fork fire in Grand County has cost $7.5 million. It has burned more than 12,097 acres and is 10% contained.
The price tag for the fires includes multiple line items, including aircraft, equipment, firefighters and the many other personnel required to manage a blaze.
For the Williams Fork fire, specifically, more than 40% of that $7.5 million tab is spent on personnel, supplies and equipment used to support firefighters, according to Robyn Broyles, information officer and former firefighter. Aircraft and heavy equipment each account for 20% of the total cost so far.
But a fire's price tag doesn't paint a complete picture of its full cost. Once a fire burns out, whenever that may be, there's still restoration work to help the ecosystem recover. Colorado has historically experienced periodic wildfires as part of its ecology, but 20th century fire suppression measures coupled with the accelerating effects of climate change mean that fires are becoming hotter and larger than the ecosystem is used to.

At the Pine Gulch fire, a burned area emergency response (BAER) team has already started to assess the fire's impact on the surrounding ecology, according to information officer T racy LeClair. Once they've studied the affected area in depth, the BAER team will then assemble a report calling for short- and long-term rehabilitation efforts to implement over the course of multiple
years.
LeClair noted it's too soon to say exactly what the Pine Gulch burn scar will need, and thus it's difficult to estimate the final cost of the fire.
With last weekend's cooler temperatures and rain showers, the rate of fire spread around the state has slowed, at least for now. The Cameron Peak fire, for example, grew by just 50 acres from Friday to Monday. Farther west, about a quarter of an inch of rain fell on the Williams Fork fire area.
The meteorological reprieve makes a significant difference to the firefighting crews on the front lines of the blaze. Thanks to that rain, Broyles said, crews have been able to integrate more heavy equipment in their efforts to help thin out the forest on the northeast side of the burn. Broyles said this is to protect towns including Fraser, Winter Park and Granby, even though the fire remains fairly far away.
""Just because the probability is low doesn't mean it's not going to happen,"" Broyles said, and it's better to be prepared for the unlikely than caught off guard.

Fremont_County_to_go_into_Stage_1_fire_ban__Daily_Record_The_Caon_City_CO___May_12_2020.txt,"Fre mo nt County to go into Stage 1 fire ban - Daily Re co rd, The (Cao n City, CO ) - May 12, 2020
May 12, 2020  Daily Record, The (Caon City, CO)  Carie Canterbury
A Stage 1 fire ban will go into effect at noon Thursday for all parts of unincorporated Fremont County.
The Fremont County Board of Commissioners on Tuesday adopted a resolution approving the ban, which is the least restrictive, at the request of Sheriff Allen Cooper.
Cooper said conditions are very dry and above 10,000 feet there is only intermittent snow.
""Our snow  although we had a lot of it this last year  it is melting very fast,"" he said. ""It's spotty snow above 10,000 feet.""
Unseasonably warm temperatures also contribute to his request for the fire ban.
The ban prohibits all trash and agricultural burning including but not limited to weeds, brush or grass; building, maintaining, attending or using a fire , campfire, coal or wood-burning stove, fireplace, any type of charcoal or wood fueled cooking, or open fire of any type in an undeveloped area. It also prohibits fireworks, outdoor welding and smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle, building or outdoor smoking area that is hard-surfaced,
Campfires contained in constructed, permanent fire pits or fire grates within a developed recreation area are allowed; grills using propane and other bottled fuels are allowed only in areas free of flammable vegetation and other flammable materials.
Commissioner Dwayne McFall said the area is in extreme drought conditions right now and other rural fire districts within the community likely will follow suit with the restrictions.
Florence District Fire Chief Calvin Sundermann also recommended a Stage 1 ban for his district, which was approved last week.
""It's an overall precaution because of the fuel loads that we have, as dry as it's been,"" he said.
Sundermann said with the state's Safer-at-Home mandate, he wanted to make sure people could still safely grill as a way to enjoy time outside with family.
""We understand people are stuck at home a lot more and people are spending more time in their yards than they were,"" he said.
The Bureau of Land Management is under a Stage 1 fire ban and the U.S. Forest Service is under a Stage 2 ban.
""We are kind of in line with everyone else,"" McFall said during Tuesday's meeting. ""No matter where you go in the county, there is a fire ban in place of some level.""
Sundermann will host a Facebook Live event at 7 p.m. Wednesday on the Penrose Fire Department Facebook page, where he will answer questions regarding COVID-19, the fire ban and more.

UPDAT E 3:30 p.m. Friday -- REMINDER: Grizzly Creek Fire community meeting, 6 p.m. tonight. The Grizzly Creek Fire Team will host a virtual FaceBook live community meeting tonight (also live streamed from the Garfield County home page in English and in Spanish, and via the Post Independent's Facebook page for those listening in English).
To view the meeting from the Garfield County home page, click on links in the red box above the fire information. The community is invited to join in the discussion and ask questions of the fire team and local officials on Facebook.
Also, this statement for fire incident command a short time ago:
""We are getting a lot of questions about Hanging Lake this morning. We know the fire moved through that area. We are working with Forest officials to assess to what extent Hanging Lake was impacted. We are waiting for the smoke to clear to assess from the air. We are not able to access from the ground via the trail because of fire activity. When we have more information, we will share it.""
UPDAT E 2 p.m. Friday -- The American Red Cross of Colorado has opened an evacuation center at Battle Mountain High school in Edwards to assist residents who have been evacuated because of the Grizzly Creek Fire , according to the fire command center. Red Cross volunteers are ready
to accommodate anyone needing information or other assistance. They will also have access to emergency supplies and support.
UPDAT E 8 a.m. Friday -- The Grizzly Creek Fire in Glenwood Canyon made a major run late Thursday night, more than doubling in size to 13,441 acres (revised after a mapping flyover) with new areas of fire spread on the east and northeast sides of the canyon.
White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams confirmed in a Friday morning press conference that the fire has burned in the area of Hanging Lake, the popular visitor attraction that now operates on a permit system.
""Right now we don't know the disposition of Hanging Lake,"" Fitzwilliams said in the press conference also attended by Gov. Jared Polis. ""We know there was fire around it. We hope to get up and take a look at it today, and as soon as we find out we will let you know.""
Added incident PIO Brian Scott in a separate interview, ""It is certainly a concern. Sometimes, fires can go so fast that it may not have caused much damage. But we just don't know until we can get in there.""
Scott acknowledged that another concern would be fire runoff eventually getting into the fragile lake ecosystem. Hanging Lake is ""a large and rare example of a travertine deposition lake and hanging garden plant community,"" the Forest Service noted in its 2018 decision to implement a fee-based hiking system to control the number of daily visitors on the rugged 2-mile trail up to the lake.
""Once the fire danger has passed, we can get in there and assess the opportunities to put in some erosion control abatement,"" Scott said. ""With that being such a valuable resource, if we can prevent damage like that we will take those measures.""
Magnitude of fire by size
By comparison in terms of fire size, the Grizzly Creek Fire is now about 800 acres larger than the 2018 Lake Christine Fire on Basalt Mountain, which burned 12,588 acres.
Gov. Polis said reopening Interstate 70 would not happen before the weekend.
""The best realistic case would be two to three days,"" Polis said. ""But it's really a question of when it's no longer right on the highway.""
According to the latest morning update from incident command in Gypsum, ""operations staff flew the fire late yesterday afternoon to access the northern area of the fire where the fire was the most active. The terrain and fuels in the northeast portion of the fire made access difficult for firefighters north of Interstate 70. The fire pushed east and went into Bair Ranch where evacuations were made.""
New maps show the most recent fire progression Thursday night into Friday morning.
Here's the latest from incident command: This is the update for Friday, Aug. 14, 2020 for the 13,441 acre Grizzly Creek Fire .
Current Situation: Yesterday the fire experienced rapid and erratic growth, challenging firefighters and prompting additional evacuations. The combination of dry vegetation, steep terrain, and the Red Flag conditions of hot, dry weather and gusty winds have continued to drive fire growth.
On Thursday, the fire grew rapidly to the east towards Bair Ranch and southeast up Devil's Hole Canyon. This resulted in an increase of acreage from 6,251 to 13,441 acres as of 10 p.m. Thursday when the fire was mapped.
Firefighters were successful in keeping the fire held in the bottom of the No Name Drainage. Today the fire will continue to be active as weather conditions remain hot and dry.
Firefighting efforts will include structure protection in the areas of Spring Valley, High Aspen and Lookout Mountain, and continued structure protection efforts in the I-70 corridor from No Name to Shoshone Power Station, Bair Ranch and Dotsero.
Helicopters will have access to refill at a portable fire -retardant mixing station and tank, which is being set up on I-70 near No Name.
An additional helibase has been established at the Glenwood Springs Airport, which is now closed to regular air traffic.
Daily operations video updates will be posted on the Grizzly Creek Fire facebook page. Maps and other information will also be posted on inciweb at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6942/.
Evacuations: Residents in communities around the Grizzly Creek Fire should stay aware of the fire's dynamic changing conditions. Anytime evacuation notices change or areas move into preevacuation status, the information will be shared at the Garfield County website at www.Garfieldcounty.com and Eagle County at www.eaglecounty.us/emergency, as well as on official FaceBook accounts and local radio stations.
Residents are strongly encouraged to sign up for updates from their respective counties. In Garfield County, go to the Garfield County website and sign up for notifications at garco911.com.
For residents of Eagle County, go to www.ecalert.org to sign up for notifications.
Road Closures: I-70 continues to be closed between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum, with no estimated time for reopening. Forest Service Road 400, Eagle-Thomasville Road, is closed due to excessive traffic and accidents resulting from drivers attempting to use this primarily dirt road as an alternate to the I-70 closure. Cottonwood Pass Road in Garfield and Eagle counties and Independence Pass are closed.
Coffee Pot Road, T ransfer Trail and Clinetop Mesa roads and areas of the Flattops accessed by those roads are also closed, as well as many surrounding White River National Forest and BLM roads.

From_the_Community_Editorial_Board_Battling__Daily_Camera_The_Boulder_CO___November_6_2020.txt,"Fro m the Co mmunity Edito rial Bo ard: Battling - Daily Came ra, The (Boulder, CO ) - No ve mbe r 6, 2020
November 6, 2020  Daily Camera, The (Boulder, CO)  Daily Camera editorial
Members of our Community Editorial Board, a group of community residents who are engaged with and passionate about local issues, respond to the following question: What steps do you think public officials should take to reduce the danger of wildfires in the region?
It's 2020. Decades from now, assuming we all survive this year, we might remember this as a year the world was literally on fire . We were breathing in smoke and ash was raining down during a global pandemic of a novel respiratory infection.
We are past the era of Smokey the Bear. His classic slogan, ""only YOU can prevent wildfires,"" places the onus of wildfire prevention on the individual. As an aside, Smokey's malignant individualism is well exemplified by the fact thathe has been adopted by MAGA apparel companies touting the motto: ""Only YOU can prevent socialism.""
Eyeroll. What I'm driving athere is that what many folks fail to (or don't want to) see is that there is a strong connection between climate change and wildfires. Public officials should absolutely continue to engage communities in an educational capacity, and they should also examine how more aggressively combating climate change will support wildfire mitigation.
The Boulder County Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) was completed in 2011, which included the creation of a citizen advisor team that met regularly in 2011. The plan is a 106-page document, and an estimated 122 individuals directly contributed to the contents of the plan's 16 chapters, 10 appendices, 45 maps, 10 videos, 20 figures and tables, 41 photos, and 29 text boxes.
I would like to see more public discourse between officials and community members about how the vision laid out in that document has or has not been upheld in the past nine years.
The discussion about wildfires begins and ends with climate change. As tempting as it might be to chalk up this year's devastating wildfireseason to the unprecedented horror that is 2020, we need to be prepared for even worse wildfireseasons in future years as temperatures continue to rise and droughts intensify. Climate change isn't going away on its own, and we are not doing enough to halt it, much less reverse it.
At the state level, Colorado should start phasing out the sales of new non-electric vehicles, as California has done, and invest in large scale infrastructure projects to improve public transit and electric vehicle charging accessibility. It is time to revisit the idea of a high speed train on the Interstate 70 corridor.
These types of projects are not just good for the environment; they also have enormous benefits related to job creation and quality of life for Coloradans. Colorado should also adopt more aggressive building codes and energy efficiency standards to ensure that we are not producing
more electricity than absolutely necessary.
At a local level, Boulder can do more to encourage zero emissions transportation options, including neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) such as scooters, e-bikes, and small electric vehicles that are essentially souped-up golf carts. Not only should the city remove any legal barriers to the use of these vehicles, they should be investing in infrastructure to physically protect bicyclists and NEV users and to prioritize their efficient passage through the city over drivers. We will not reduce vehicle-related emissions until we give people real incentives to get out of their cars.
Yes, there are costs associated with these climate initiatives, but keep in mind that we've spent hundreds of millions of dollars fighting wildfires this year alone. The tobacco industry was eventually held financially accountable for the enormous costs to society caused by its products. When will the oil and gas industries face similar consequences?
As most of us know, wildfires are part of the West and, in most cases, are an important part of the habitat life cycle. They occur not only in the forested mountains, but also on Boulder County's grasslands. With weeks of horrible smoke and closure of our open spaces, this year has shown us that our homes don't have to be directly affected by a wildfire for us to feel their impact on our community ;
I am not an expert on wildfires or wildfire mitigation, so I called up Jim Webster with Boulder County's wildfire mitigation team. As it turns out, Boulder County actually has a world class fire mitigation plan that is being emulated by cities in all other parts of the world.
As Mr. Webster explained it, Boulder County and the U.S. Forest Service do a lot of forest management, the prescribed thinning and burning of trees, but this can only get us so far. This is because, one, it won't guarantee that we won't have fires, and, two, we don't have the resources to mitigate the thousands of acres of forest and grasslands in our community.
Therefore, we need to learn to live with fire and mitigate our properties to reduce its effects. Boulder County actually has a program, called Wildfire Partners, that mountain residents can apply to and receive fire audits of their properties.
The audits are similar in nature to home energy audits and can give homeowners reports about fire mitigation measures they can take on their properties. It isn't a guarantee that your property will survive a wildfire, but it may help.
Currently, there approximately 2,000 property owners enrolled, with goals to accept 500 additional applicants each year. With the Calwood and Lefthand fires, many more applicants will apply and this program needs additional investment to serve all of these homeowners.
What steps do our public officials need to take? Continue investment in the Wildfires Partner's program, be actively involved with state, federal, and local agencies to secure funding and remove roadblocks with forest management, review of our local building codes to ensure we are building fire -wise communities, and, perhaps, looking again at a special tax district to secure stable funding
for wildfire prevention.
Democrats love to tout how they will follow ""the science."" They follow the science under the exact same circumstances as Republicans: when it furthers their political ideology. Republicans are just not nearly as sanctimonious with their hypocrisy.
If you only discuss climate change in reference to forest fires, you care not a whit about the people affected by forest fires. We could spend trillions of dollars to reduce global temperatures by a few degrees 80 years from now, but absolutely nothing we can do from a carbon dioxide perspective, as a city, state, nation, planet, will have any effect on fires in the next few decades.
Yes, we should continue efforts to phase out fossil fuels, but that will not bring relief to those in harm's way.
Forest fires are inevitable. And they are an essential part of a forest 's health. But it's tragic when your house is in the burning forest . It's akin to building along the coast where a hurricane is inevitable. It's only a matter of time; it's going to happen, and there is absolutely nothing we can do to stop it.
Mitigation and quick response are our best tools. If we live in forests, then we must maintain them. That means removing fuel from the forest floor. My buddy lives inside Yosemite National Park, in a housing division called Yosemite West, which is located in a dense sub-alpine forest . This forest is routinely and expensively raked and harvested of downed timber and brush.
We also need a more proactive program to find and extinguish fires early. Drones could be used to patrol lightning-prone areas. We should be using better technology to allow more types of planes to join the fight. All this is expensive, but must be weighed against the huge cost of inaction. We'll pay either way, but if we pay up front, it's likely to be cheaper and less devastating to houses and lives.

Garfield County bans fireworks use ahead of Independence Day.txt,"Garfield County bans fireworks use ahead of Independence Day
holiday, set to enter Stage 1 fire restrictions Friday
June 15, 2021  Post Independent (Glenwood Springs, CO)
Author: John Stroud jstroud@postindependent.com Section: Local 842 Words
OpenURL Link
Fireworks use is now prohibited for the final weeks leading up to the July Fourth holiday in
unincorporated parts of Garfield County, and broader Stage 1 fire restrictions are coming if not already in
place in area jurisdictions.
Garfield County commissioners on Monday expanded the county's existing year-round ban on fireworks
use to include the otherwise exempt period from June 14 through July 5 ahead of and one day beyond
Independence Day.
The ban applies both to fireworks that can be purchased legally in Colorado  those that don't shoot off
the ground or explode, such as sparklers, fountains and spinners  as well as illegal aerial fireworks,
firecrackers and other explosives often brought in from neighboring states that allow such sales.
The ban does not apply to the sale of legal fireworks in the county.
""It is drying out quickly, and the conditions are there,"" said Chris Bornholdt, emergency manager for the
Garfield County Sheriff's Office. ""We don't need to take any chances with fireworks getting in the brush
and starting a big fire for us.""
The fireworks use ban, approved 3-0 by the commissioners, is effective immediately.
Meanwhile, neighboring Pitkin and Eagle counties announced Tuesday that they will be moving to
broader Stage 1 fire restrictions on Wednesday, and Garfield County plans to follow suit effective Friday.
""I wouldn't be surprised if shortly after, maybe next week or so, we'll want to go to (more restrictive)
Stage 2,"" Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario said Tuesday evening. ""It's pretty damn hot and dry out
there.""
Glenwood Springs Stage 1 restrictions will begin concurrently with the county restrictions on Friday,
according to a city news release.
""It is everyone's responsibility to use fire safely and adhere to the fire restrictions,"" Glenwood Mayor
Jonathan Godes said in the release. ""These important restrictions intentionally target ways thathelp our
community reduce fire risk and prevent wildfires during periods of high fire danger.""
Area fire departments, federal land agencies and the Sheriff's Office meet every Tuesday morning to
assess the current fire danger and try to reach consensus on how to proceed, he said.
Land management officials, including the U.S. Forest Service White River National Forest and Bureau of
Land Management are also expected to implement their own restrictions later in the week, according to a
news release from the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office.
STAGE 1 RESTRICTIONS
The fire restrictions, per local fire management officials, apply to the following persons and activities:
A. Building, maintaining, attending or using a fire or campfire except within a developed recreation site, or
improved site to include a fire ring/pit.
B. Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle, building or area cleared of all combustible materials.
C. Operating or using an internal or external combustion engine without an approved spark-arresting
device properly installed, maintained and in effective working order meeting either the U.S. Forest
Service standards or appropriate Society of Automotive Engineers recommended practices.
D. Use of any personal fireworks or explosive requiring fuses or blasting caps, including exploding
targets, as defined by Colorado Revised Statute 12-28-101(8).
At the Monday Garfield County commissioners meeting, Ray Cordova, who operates the seasonal
fireworks stand at the intersection of Cattle Creek and Colorado Highway 82 near Carbondale, objected
to the fireworks use ban.
""I know we look like the bad guys, and we are aware of the conditions. We are not ignorant of it,""
Cordova said.
However, he said the legal fireworks he sells are not the likely source of brush fire ignition. Rather, that's
more likely to come from the illegal fireworks that are purchased and imported from Wyoming and other
states where such sales are legal, he said.
""Fireworks is something families have been doing to celebrate our independence for ages. People enjoy
them,"" Cordova said, adding most revelers know to take precautions such as lighting them on a cleared
dirt or paved surface and watering down any nearby vegetation.
""The word 'fire' in front of 'works' gives a bad connotation,"" Cordova said. ""Maybe if we called them
'independence works' it would be different.""
He added thathe and his wife, Aurora, use the fireworks sales stand as a fundraiser for their evangelical
Christian ministry.
County Commissioner Mike Samson said he agreed with Cordova's sentiments around personal
freedoms. But the worsening drought situation and resulting fire danger can't be ignored, he said.
""Much of the West is in  exceptional drought,"" Samson said. ""We have to pay attention to some things
here.""
Commissioner Tom Jankovsky said he generally doesn't believe in ""big-government regulations,"" but, ""I
do believe government needs to make decisions on things that affect the health, safety and welfare of
their constituents.
""People are frightened of wildfire, and for good reason,"" he said.
Stage 1 restrictions prohibit open burning of trash or ditches, open campfires outside of developed fire
pits, charcoal grills, fireworks and other incendiary devices. Fireworks are always illegal to use on Forest
Service lands.
The move to Stage 1 restrictions also means that when the county issues a red-flag warning, it
automatically moves restrictions up to the next level.

Glenwood_Canyon_travelers_advised_to_stay_vigilant__Vail_Daily_CO___May_6_2021.txt,"Gle nwo o d Canyo n trave le rs advise d to stay vigilant - Vail Daily (CO ) - May 6, 2021
Recreation and travel in Glenwood Canyon will be much more hazardous due to the potential rockfall and debris flows originating from destabilized ground, rock and weakened trees burned by the Grizzly Creek Fire last summer.
A closure plan for the Glenwood Springs canyon trails and bike paths, as well as the section of Interstate 70 that runs through the burn-scarred slopes, was presented during a community meeting Tuesday night.
The Colorado Department of Transportation developed a closure plan to protect the traveling public from debris flow where safety closures would be triggered in the event of a flash flood warning, closing I-70 in Glenwood Canyon from Exit 116 (Glenwood Springs) to Exit 133 (Dotsero).
Local law enforcement officers will be stationed at the closure barricades to prevent travelers from entering the burn scar area until CDOT has determined it is safe for the traveling public.
Lisa Stoeffler with the U.S. Forest Service provided more information on best safety practices for travelers in the event they encounter debris flow.
""Always stay in your vehicle, that's the safety place to be,"" Stoeffler said.
""When you're thinking about recreation and whether it's safe to recreate in a burned area, I do want to say that burned areas, especially ones that burn relatively hot like Grizzly Creek did, are inherently dangerous.""
Stoeffler said the steep slopes and overhead hazards in the burn area increase the level of risk for injury to both drivers and pedestrians recreating within the canyon.
""Anything that can happen on the interstate can happen in the back country,"" Stoeffler said.
""There's always that risk of debris flows and flash floods as well, as fire weakened trees and rocks starting to move around.""
One of the leading hazards in burned areas are fire-weakened trees coming down, Stoeffler said.
""T ree crowns and large limbs can blow out,"" she said. ""So please be aware anytime you're in dense forest or where you have overhead hazards there's a risk of those trees falling down and they come down silently.""
Hikers and cyclists should stay on the trail as much as possible, as the ground around the trails is likely to be more unstable.
""Stumps and roots burned hot during the fire,"" Stoeffler said.
""Though it might not be evident from the surface, the ground underneath can be unstable. You can drop into a stump hole.""
Lisa Langer, Director of Tourism Promotion and Visit Glenwood, provided information on upcoming hospitality training sessions for Glenwood Springs businesses and frontline workers to help keep visitors safe as they recreate and travel through Glenwood Canyon.
""We want them to make sure they're watching weather reports, they're tuning into www.cotrip.org and we want you as a business or as a frontline worker to please watch for those alerts,"" Langer said.
The city and Glenwood Springs Chamber Resort Association will be providing safety alerts as well, Langer said.
""We just want everyone to be aware that because there are extenuating circumstances following the fire that we will need to know what's going on,"" Langer said. ""We can definitely get through this. We're excited about the summer season.""
Two sessions -- one in the morning and the other in the afternoon -- are slated for May 18.
Both sessions will provide in-person training to hospitality workers. To register for the training, go to http://www.glenwoodchamber.com/seminars.
Bryana Starbuck, Glenwood Springs city public information officer, said Glenwood Springs residents can lead by example with positivity and preparedness.
""The important thing to remember is that we are such a strong and resilient community,"" Starbuck said.
Residents of No Name will also be provided access to their homes during the safety closures, so long as they can provide identification or an updated utility bill as proof of address to local law enforcement manning the closure points.
""Garfield County Sheriff's office often attends access points, so it's a good idea to sign up for any alerts they may have,"" Starbuck said.
If a safety closure of I-70 in Glenwood Canyon is anticipated to last longer than two hours, CDOT recommends a northern alternate route using Colorado Highway 9, U.S. Highway 40 and Colorado Highway 13.
Motorists coming from the Denver metro area or Interstate 25 can travel westbound on I-70 to Silverthorne, then turn north onto Colorado Highway 9. In Kremmling, travelers should turn onto westbound US Highway 40 toward Steamboat Springs. After reaching Craig, motorists can return south via Colorado Highway 13 toward Rifle. Access to I-70 westbound is at Rifle.
Motorists traveling eastbound from Utah or Grand Junction can reach the Denver Metro area by
traveling the route above in reverse.

An informational webinar for property owners about flooding risks following the Grizzly Creek Fire is scheduled for 6 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 9.
""The Flood After Fire webinar will include speakers from Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Flood Insurance Program, Garfield County Sheriff's Office, and the Forest Service,"" a news release from the city states.
Webinar information and link can be found on the City of Glenwood Springs Agenda page.
The Grizzly Creek Fire began Aug. 10 and is currently 32,464 acres in size and is 91% contained.
Burn areas along waterways -- including No Name, Grizzly Creek and the Colorado River -- have increased the risk of debris flows and flooding.
""As Glenwood Canyon recovers from the devastation caused by the Grizzly Creek wildfire, the City of Glenwood Springs and Garfield County warns residents living in and surrounding wildfire areas about the high risk of flash flooding and mudflows, and urges them to evaluate flood insurance for their homes, businesses, or properties,"" the release states.
Floods are the most common natural disaster in the U.S. -- and the most expensive, the release states.
""Just an inch of water in (an) average-size home can cause more than $25,000 in damage,"" the release states. ""Most homeowners and renters insurance policies do not cover flood damage. Flood insurance is a separate policy that protects homes and belongings.""
In the release, Glenwood Springs Mayor Jonathan Godes said the potential for impacts will likely persist for years to come.
""The impacts of a wildfire on flooding can occur immediately, or they can take a few years,"" Godes said. ""The city is taking action now to educate residents on how to protect themselves and their property or business. I am proud of the coordinated recovery response that is taking place and hope the community utilizes this opportunity to be informed and avoid future tragedy.""

Only you can prevent water shortages.
As the Grizzly Creek Fire restricts city water resources, Glenwood Springs renewed a plea for residents to adhere to current water restrictions, a city spokesperson said.
""This time of year, we usually draw water out of No Name and Grizzly creeks,"" said Matt Langhorst, the Glenwood Springs Public Works director. ""But there's a rather large fire working its way up both No Name and Grizzly, so we had the U.S. Forest Service shut off our diversion at Grizzly Creek.""
Without water from Grizzly Creek, the city is relying heavily on No Name Creek, and supplementing it with a draw on the Roaring Fork River.
""There's not enough water in No Name for us to rely solely on it at our current usage,"" Langhorst said, explaining the city typically consumes about 5 million gallons of water a day. ""But the water from Roaring Fork isn't great. It's got a lot more sediment in it as well as upstream chemicals.""
The city implemented an alternating lawn-watering schedule Saturday, but usage was nearly back to normal on Sunday and Monday.
""We haven't seen people alternate days of watering their lawns,"" Langhorst said. ""Or, they have, but they are watering for twice as long, which defeats the purpose.""
If residents fail to comply with the alternating schedule through Friday, the city will return to a complete restriction of watering lawns for the foreseeable future, and staff could prosecute violators, a city news release said.
""If we use less water, we can draw solely out of No Name, which is ideal,"" Langhorst said. ""If we can't come together as a community and use less water, we'll have to restrict all outdoor watering .""
Due to the impacts from the Grizzly Creek Fire , water usage within the City will most likely be restricted into 2021 and potentially beyond, the news release said.
The alternating schedule is as follows: Odd-numbered home addresses can water on odd days of the month and even-numbered home addresses can water on even days of the month.
In addition to alternating outdoor watering, indoor usage should also be limited by taking shorter showers, not filling pools, setting appliances to a water-saving mode and minimizing car washes.
Excess water usage can drop the water-storage levels in the city's water tanks, leaving less to fight
fires inside town should they arise, Langhorst said.
""If a fire happens in town for any reason, we'll need that storage, which we just don't have right now,"" he explained.
Mayor Pro T em Shelley Kaup said she's received numerous questions about how residents can help the firefighting efforts.
""The best thing you can do right now is conserve water,"" Kaup said. ""It's critical we come together as a community and reduce our water usage.""

May 8, 2021  Daily Reporter-Herald, The (Loveland, CO)  Max Levy
Gov. Jared Polis, Rep. Joe Neguse and others on Friday surveyed the destruction caused by last year's Cameron Peak Fire , which continues to pose a threat to local water resources.
After visiting Chambers Lake, where in August the blaze was sparked that would go on to torch 326 square miles and become the largest wildfire in Colorado's history, officials met at the Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District's Station No. 2.
T ucked deep in the canyon, the outpost was evacuated during the historic fire, and stands of burned trees are still visible around the mountain station.
Polis said the group spoke at the lake about the ongoing threats posed to the region's watersheds, including that of the Cache La Poudre River, much of which was crossed by the fire.
""When you have these large fires, there are a lot of threats to the watersheds from ash and also landslides,"" he said. ""This is going to create a danger of mudslides for the next several years.""
To mitigate the danger, regional partners are working to plant trees and constructing barriers to hold back contaminated soil.
Kristin Garrison of the Colorado State Forest Service described the organization's role in growing seedling trees for conservation purposes, including post-fire rehabilitation.
""We are planning ahead as best we can,"" she said, and brought up the Restoring Colorado's Forests Fund, through which private property owners can apply for free seedling trees. ""Depending on the burn severity on their property, they're dealing with having to rebuild their home, which is first and foremost, or if they still have their home, they're dealing with the vegetative component.""
She said the nursery is capable of growing 600,000 trees per year in addition to shrubs but hopes to expand with the help of federal stimulus dollars.
Besides elected reps and officials from Colorado's departments of Agriculture, Local Affairs, Natural Resources and Public Safety, representatives of local water agencies and cities along the Poudre as well as Larimer County spoke up Friday.
""For these communities that didn't have great connections prior to the fire, and now they're going to be going through possible flooding, we're really trying to build those connections now,"" Larimer County director of emergency management Lori Hodges said, bringing up the role of Larimer Connects in building resilience. ""The more connected a community is, the better they recover.""
Hodges said the county has been working with the sheriff's office to model debris flows, and that, starting Monday, sandbags will be used to ""armor"" roads, culverts and possibly homes in the zone
at risk for flooding.
Larimer County commissioner Jody Shadduck-McNally spoke about the need to rehabilitate hydrophobic soil -- one of the ecological consequences of wildfires is that superheated soil may form a water-resistant crust that does not absorb water, increasing the risk of flooding and erosion.
""Nothing is going to grow until that soil gets rehabilitated,"" she said.
Fort Collins water quality services manager Jill Oropeza brought up her city's partnership with the city of Greeley, Northern Water, the watershed coalition and other groups, and said 11,000 acres are being targeted to be mulched, which will help moisten the affected soil.
""Obviously, we can't apply mulch to the entire burn area,"" she said. ""Any dollar we can spend holding the soil in place on the landscape saves us a lot of dollars that would be spent removing it downstream.""
The Cameron Peak Fire was sparked Aug. 13 and claimed 469 buildings, including 42 primary homes. It was declared contained on Dec. 2.

Gov._Polis_signs_wildfire_recovery_mitigation__Greeley_Tribune_CO___June_20_2021.txt,"Go v. Po lis signs wildfire re co ve ry, mitigatio n - Gre e le y T ribune (CO ) - June 20, 2021
June 20, 2021  Greeley Tribune (CO)  Trevor Reid
As the Cameron Peak fire burned more than 208,000 acres last year, it burned up vegetation around Greeley's high mountain reservoirs, setting the stage for erosion to dirty water usually treated by the city and delivered to customers' taps.
The city of Greeley is working with Larimer County and the Coalition for the Poudre River Watershed, as well as a few other water providers, to lead recovery efforts, which will help prevent erosion. With such a large burn area, the work will be immense and expensive.
Sean Chambers, director of the city's water and sewer department, is leveraging local and state funding with federal funding to power the recovery. Two bills Gov. Jared Polis signed this past week will support watershed restoration efforts, as well as wildfire mitigation, with a total of $55 million transferred out of the state's general fund.
Senate Bill 240 provides $30 million to the Colorado Water Conservation Board for watershed recovery. Though city water officials were excited to see the bill signed, Chambers said, the money will be spread out over many needs, as the state had its three largest wildfires in 2020. City officials hope to secure between $5 million and $10 million of the $30 million stimulus for the recovery.
When the board started the year with $5 million for watershed recovery grants, Cameron Peak recovery was awarded about $1.5 million, according to Chambers.
Federal funding has also been secured through the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Emergency Watershed Protection program. The program is focused on recovery of private property, creating a challenge as much of the burn area is in federally owned land. Because the city has special use permits with the U.S. Forest Service to operate its network of reservoirs, it was allowed to access the money to mitigate damages to the water infrastructure.
Even with these funding sources, officials continue to face challenges securing enough immediate funding for restoration and recovery. Even if the city is awarded the amount of SB 240 money officials are hoping for, Chambers estimated the funding gap will still be in the area of $25 million to $30 million. City officials are continuing to pursue federal funding and other opportunities.
The first year of recovery is the most important time to reestablish vegetation, keep the soil on the hillside and keep sediment and debris out of the river. Among the techniques used are area mulching and the construction of sediment and debris traps.
Mulching helps reestablish the vegetation, keep the soil on the hill and lock moisture into the soil, so roots can redevelop. It's expensive, but effective, and one of the city's primary focuses for recovery. Work is kicking off now for area mulching around the city's reservoirs. Chambers said they just executed a $1 million contract for mitigation around those reservoirs.
The city's been able to prioritize recovery efforts using a post-fire burn area assessment and
severity analysis conducted by Colorado State University, the U.S. Forest Service and the Coalition for the Poudre River Watershed. Chambers said that information helps the city maximize a very limited budget to protect the watershed.
Due to severe burning at a couple of the city's reservoirs, the city won't even store water in them this year. Chambers said the volumes are relatively small, so it won't impede the city's ability to provide water to customers. If the city allowed the reservoirs to fill with water, they would fill with sediment, which would lead to very expensive treatment.
Thanks to a wet spring and early summer, the area doesn't have the same fire risk this year as there is on the West Slope. But there are pretty significant areas of the Upper Colorado and Big T hompson not yet touched by wildfire.
As temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, soil and vegetation get drier. Chambers said these conditions will lead to more record-setting years of wildfire across Colorado and the West.
""We know when you compound that fact pattern with about a century of fire suppression in our forests and very limited mitigation and limited controlled burns that we have some forests in our watershed that are ripe for future wildfire,"" Chambers said.
Senate Bill 258 invests $25 million into wildfire mitigation in targeted locations. Mitigation includes techniques such as prescribed burns, taking out lower tree branches and removing deadfall. Fire breaks, where there's no fuel for fires to grow, also help prevent fires from spreading. For example, the burn area from the High Park fire prevented a lot of growth for the Cameron Peak fire, Chambers said.
Addressing beetle kill is another important element, as it fueled explosive growth of the East Troublesome fire last year. Chambers said it's important to find an economically viable use for those dead trees and an environmentally appropriate way to harvest and use them.
With the high likelihood of increased wildfire across the west and the immense need to recover from these wildfires, city officials are collaborating with Northern Water to work through federal lobbyists to try getting additional funding for the Emergency Watershed Protection program, the best tool for recovering from wildfire.
The program is only funded through disaster bills at the federal level, with no annual federal appropriation. A regular funding mechanism would benefit not only Greeley water customers and Northern Water customers, but municipal water utilities across the state, Chambers said.

Governor_state_officials_provide_updates_on_East__Gazette_The_Colorado_Springs_CO___October_22_2020.txt,"Go ve rno r, state o fficials p ro vide up date s o n East - Gaze tte , The (Colorado Springs, CO ) - O cto be r 22, 20 20
October 22, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Marianne Goodland
Gov. Jared Polis, joined by a half-dozen state officials and others, said he has activated the Colorado National Guard to assist with the East Troublesome fire that has affected Grand Lake, Rocky Mountain National Park and the town of Estes Park.
The town is now under a mix of voluntary and mandatory evacuation orders. A small portion of the fire, which burned 100,000 acres in less than 24 hours, jumped the Continental Divide on Thursday, according to Stan Hilkey, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety. That's what prompted the evacuation orders for Estes Park, he said.
About 6,500 homes are in the affected areas, although some are second homes and the state does not have a firm number on the number of people so far evacuated.
Scott Jalbert, commander for the US Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Area Command, said the fires continue to grow and threaten Estes Park. A weather system moving in Thursday afternoon will shift the winds from the northwest to the west, and that will continue to impact communities' in the fire areas. There will be ""critical fire behavior"" during the next 24 to 36 hours, he said.
Their main focus is to move resources from fires that are coming under control, like the CalWood wildfire in Boulder county, and to move those resources to both the East Troublesome and Cameron Peak wildfires.
As to the Cameron Peak fire , Jalbert said it continues to move north and south, driven by those winds, which could reach 25 to 30 mph on Thursday.
""We are focusing on life,"" making sure people are evacuated out of those areas. ""We do not have enough resources to completely envelope those fires. We are in a defensive mode, protecting what we can,"" Jalbert said.
Mike Morgan, the division director for the Department of Public Safety's fire prevention team, said fire investigators believe East Troublesome is likely human-caused but no final determination has been made yet.
Incident meteorologists are embedded with the fire crews, according to Greg Hanson of the National Weather Service, Boulder. Overall, it will be a ""tough go of it"" for the afternoon and into the evening, with lots of wind and low humidity. He does expect a light dusting of snow Thursday night. While it will not provide a lot of moisture it will ""wet things down a bit"" and reduce some of the more extreme fire behavior.
Hanson added thathe's optimistic that cooler winds will keep the fire out of Estes Park and stay in the higher elevations of Rocky Mountain National Park. Buthe advised people to heed the evacuation orders.
""It's going to be close on the western edge of the city,"" he said.
Saturday, however, is another matter. Very strong winds are expected that will push those fires around, Hanson said. After Saturday, the main precipitation event will be on Sunday, which could produce a foot of snow at higher elevations. This storm will not be a fire-season ender, he said, but it could allow firefighters to get the upper hand. Hanson said he doesn't expect major snowfall events until November.
The state's response has included the state patrol assisting local law enforcement with evacuations, especially Wednesday night as the East Troublesome fire grew, reportedly at 6,000 acres per hour at one point. Members of the Division of Fire Prevention and Control are also out fighting the fires, Hilkey said, and the state is also involved in helping with sheltering and recovery.
""It is a very robust effort,"" Hilkey said. ""We engage with whomever is involved"" with the fires, depending on whether the fire is on state, federal or private land.
Kevin Klein, director of the state's Homeland Security Management, said their first priority is life and safety and supporting search and rescue operations, to ensure residents in the affected areas are accounted for. They're also attempting to secure additional firefighters and fire engines. Klein said 278 hotel rooms have been obtained to house those evacuated, making sure those accommodations meet COVID-19 standards for social distancing.
Unfortunately, the Global Supertanker, based in Colorado Springs, is in use in California. ""We have the ability but we don't have the access"" to it, said Morgan. Polis indicated it probably would not have helped, given how quickly the East Troublesome fire went from 10,000 to 100,000 acres. Hilkey added that they are using a heavy air tanker, and have been deploying it throughout the summer.
Damage assessment will start as soon as possible, Klein said, but that will take time. They will be looking at the impact of the fires on watersheds and critical infrastructure. ""Recovery operations will take time...but we're committed to bringing communities back to the best of our ability,"" he said.
""It's humbling for humanity in the face of massive fires,"" Polis added. The state's interventions are designed to save lives and buildings, but in unpopulated areas, Mother Nature, wind and precipitation are in charge.
Polis made a plea for financial assistance to those impacted by the fires. Cash donations allow for flexible and immediate support.
Donations can be accepted at coloradoresponds.org, which covers a variety of needs; LarimerCountyFires.com or BoulderCountyFires.com, both which link to the United Way in those counties.
Polis also thanked ""the men and women who run toward the flames. Some are professionals, some are volunteers with day jobs who drop everything at a moment's notice,"" as well as those
working in emergency operations centers.
The governor also addressed the role of climate change and beetle-killed pine in the fires. ""We've seen drier, hotter conditions in our state"" as well as a statewide drought and those factors have led to climate conditions that are ideal for rapid growth of forest fires, he said.

What: Muddy Slide Fire
When: Currently active; ignited Sunday, June 20
Where: Wildfire burning east of the town of Yampa in South Routt County. Estimated at 4,056 acres as of
8 a.m. June 24.
More: Mandatory evacuation in place for residents on Routt County Road 16 between mile markers 12
and 21.
Cause: Unknown at this point
1:57 p.m. The U.S. Forest Service has extended the closures in the Medicine-Bow Routt National
Forest, effective immediately. The purpose of the order is to prevent anyone from interfering with
firefighters while they work in addition to keeping people safe.
Closed roads and trails include: west of National Forest Service Road (NFSR) 100 from NFSR 250 to
National Forest Service Trail 1106, NFSR 102, NFSR 226, NFSR 227, NFSR 249, west of NFSR 250,
NFSR 263, NFSR 264, NFSR 268, NFSR 268.1J, NFSR 270 (Routt County Road 16), NFSR 270.1D,
NFSR 272, NFSR 275, NFSR 280, NFSR 282, NFSR 285, 1100 Rock Creek Mountain Bike Trail, 1106
Silver Creek Trail, 1173 Teepee Creek Trail, 1174 Morrison-Divide Trail, Lagunita Lake Parking Area and
Lynx Pass Campground.
1:52 p.m. Skies are darkening in the Yampa Valley as scatted thunderstorms are expected to roll
through the area Thursday afternoon. Temperatures are expected to be lower and the humidity higher
over the next few days.
Thursday was the first day this week where Routt County was not under a Red Flag warning.
Cass Cairns, public affairs specialist with the Bureau of Land Management, said people should not
expect rain Thursday to ""put out the fire,"" as it would really only have an effect on what firefighters call the
""fine jewels,"" like grasses and small thin limbs that will be able to absorb some of the moisture.
""If we only get an 1/8-inch or a 1/4-inch, it won't make any difference at all, because after this weekend it
is going to warm right back up,"" Carins said. ""Any moisture that goes into that ground is going to be gone
by the first day of hot weather.""
The main fuel source of the fire right now is fir, spruce and lodgepole pine, and Cairns said that these
would still burn even if it was raining.
1:30 p.m. Two teams of hotshots, which work on the hottest part of the fire, are directly engaging the fire
Thursday near Muddy Slide Trail to create an anchor point on the fire.
""An anchor is a point to start with where you have got it set, you've got it controlled, you've got a good
line on it and then you work from there,"" Cairns said.
On the north side of the fire, engine crews are working on structure protection where the fire has already
burned, ensuring that there are no hotspots that could flare up, Cairns said.
""They are securing those residences that are there, making sure that nothing flairs up,"" Cairns said.
""Once that is all secured, then they can start considering lifting the evacuations.""
To lift an evacuation order, the Routt County Sheriff's Office would need to be sure that those areas are
no longer in any danger from the fire. When opened the area would likely only be open to residents, law
enforcement and firefighters, but there is no timetable for reopening at this time.
1:07 p.m. The Routt County Sheriff's Office is currently assessing property damage from the Muddy
Slide Fire. Residents have reported to Steamboat Pilot & Today that there have been buildings and other
structures lost to the fire  including at least seven mobile homes and one cabin  though that has not
yet been confirmed.
Cairns said information about what properties have been affected would be released by the sheriff's
office after landowners were notified, if there was any damage. Cairns stressed there is no official word
about property loss at this time.
""We don't say anything, including the sheriff's department, until the property owners  if there is any
damage or loss  until those property owners are notified,"" Cairns said.
12:15 p.m. On the south side of the fire, firefighters are removing fuels and applying retardant along a
powerline easement, to use that area as a fire line. On the north side, along Routt County Road 16, a
structure group is developing a detailed plan to protect structures and implementing point protection. On
the northwest corner of the fire, hotshot crews are building fire lines directly along the edge of the fire to
create an anchor point. This will be used to prevent the fire from moving further north.
All ground resources are being supported by water and retardant drops from five helicopters. Fire
managers are scouting for additional opportunities to safely engage the fire where there is the highest
probability for success.
On Thursday, the fire area is forecast to receive afternoon showers, thunderstorms and increased
moisture, reducing fire behavior in the short-term, giving firefighters an opportunity to safely engage the
fire.
10:35 a.m. While it's clearly appreciated, crews fighting the Muddy Slide Fire cannot accept and do not
require food or other items from the community. That's the role of the Blue Team, which brings in the
necessary food, personal items and equipment needed for that day. If people are interested in
contributing, they are asked to make donations to local fire departments or fire-related charities.
9:49 a.m. The morning meeting at the Muddy Slide Fire.
8:15 a.m. The Rocky Mountain Blue Type 2 incident management team assumed command of the fire at
6 a.m. Thursday. Crews will continue to work along the active fire perimeter with support from aerial
resources.
The National Weather Service is calling for a 70% chance of rain and thunderstorms over the fire area
today.
The fire is now 4,056 acres and was somewhat less active Wednesday, showing little growth around its
perimeter.
8:05 a.m. The Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment has issued another air quality health
advisory to include all of Routt County due to the wildfire. The advisory remains in effect until 9 a.m.
Friday.
Moderate to heavy smoke from the Muddy Slide Fire, as well as the Sylvan wildfire in Eagle County and
several other Colorado and out-of-state wildfires, is expected Wednesday through Thursday morning.
Heaviest smoke impacts will likely occur during the overnight and early morning hours in valley locations
and in areas in close vicinity to the local wildfires, according to the health department.
Those sensitive to smoke, especially if they have heart disease, respiratory illnesses, are very young or
elderly, may want to stay indoors. Outdoor activity should be limited when moderate to heavy smoke is
present.
8 a.m. Thursday: The Muddy Slide Fire Evacuation Center will now be located at Soroco Middle School,
adjacent to the high school, and will open at 10 a.m.

The East Troublesome fire more than lived up to its name, growing by more than 100,000 acres in the past 24 hours to become the fourth largest wildfire in state history and forcing thousands more residents to hurriedly flee their homes, authorities said.
Residents of the small town of Grand Lake on the western side of Rocky Mountain National Park were evacuated Wednesday to Granby and through the park over Trail Ridge Road. By Thursday, the western side of Trail Ridge was impassable -- trees felled by the fire blocked the road, officials said.
Rocky Mountain National Park, a treasured destination for Coloradans and out-of-state visitors, was closed Thursday after the fire spread to the park and to allow for some of the evacuees to reach Estes Park. Their safe haven lasted only hours -- the fire jumped the Continental Divide, Stan Hilkey, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety said Thursday, resulting in parts of Estes Park also being evacuated.
T anvir Malik was among those told to leave Estes Park as the fires sent charred pine needles raining down on the town Thursday. From his store, Eastside Groceries, he was watching lines of cars crawling out of town and debating when to leave.
""Now its getting crazy. Even if I close right now I can't get out,"" he said.
Growing at a rate of 6,000 acres an hour, the East Troublesome fire blew up overnight from around 20,000 acres to more than 125,000 acres, driven by gale-force winds that have rarely let up since the fire started Oct. 14, fanning flames in beetle-killed timber stands dried out by drought and and extreme heat throughout August.
""The growth we had on this fire is unheard of,"" said Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin said. ""This is the worst of the worst of the worst.""
Officials did not have a firm number of people who are under orders to evacuate. Although there are 6,500 houses in the affected areas, some are second homes and may not be occupied. Officials believe structures may have been lost, but were unable to say how many.
Mike Morgan, the division director for the Department of Public Safety's fire prevention team, said investigators believe the fire was human caused, but have not made a determination yet.
Scott Jalbert, head of the U.S. Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Area Command, said the East Troublesome fire and the Cameron Peak fire, the largest in Colorado history burning west of Fort Collins, continue to grow and threaten towns and mountain communities.
""We are focusing on life,"" Jalbert saidsiad. . ""We do not have enough resources to completely
envelope those fires. We are in a defensive mode, protecting what we can."" J
Fire managers are attempting to move resources from fires that are more under control, including the CalWood fire in Boulder County which forced the evacuation Sunday of the town of Jamestown, to the East Troublesome and Cameron Peak wildfires.
Greg Hanson, of the National Weather Service in Boulder, , said it will be a ""tough go of it"" into Thursday evening, with lots of wind and low humidity. Hanson said a light dusting of snow Thursday night will not provide a lot of moisture, but it will ""wet things down a bit"" and reduce some of the more extreme fire behavior.
Hanson said he's optimistic the fire won't reach Estes Park, but advised people to heed the evacuation orders.
""It's going to be close on the western edge of the city,"" he said.
Saturday, however, is another matter. Very strong winds are expected that will push those fires around, Hanson said. On Sunday, a winter blast could bring a foot of snow at higher elevations. This storm will not be a fire-season ender, he said, but it could allow firefighters to get the upper hand. It will be a short reprieve -- Hanson said he doesn't expect more snow until November.
At a midday news conference Gov. Jared Polis said he has activated the Colorado National Guard to assist with the East Troublesome fire.
""It's humbling for humanity in the face of massive fires,"" Polis said.
Polis made a plea for financial assistance for those impacted by the fires. Donations can be made at coloradoresponds.org, LarimerCountyFires.com or BoulderCountyFires.com, Grandfoundation.com.
Polis thanked ""the men and women who run toward the flames. Some are professionals, some are volunteers with day jobs who drop everything at a moment's notice,"" as well as those working in emergency operations centers.

With the East Troublesome Fire barely six months ago, Grand County is reconsidering planning and prevention for future fires.
On Tuesday, commissioners heard from Grand Fire Chief Brad White and Schelly Olson, both representing the Grand County Wildfire Counsel, about an opportunity with the Community Planning Assistance for Wildfire program.
White started by pointing out the growing number and increasing acreage of wildfires in the county, and he emphasized the need for a proactive versus reactive approach.
""What I think fire chiefs understand and what the community understands is that the world's changing around us,"" White said. ""Whether it's the foresthealth or whatever the conditions are, we are definitely getting increased fire .""
CPAW is a program from Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit research group that offers free planning recommendations to help build wildfire resilient communities. The organization offers land use planning, hazard assessments, resources for building capacity, and customized research and tools.
White explained that with this changing landscape, preparation is key for future fire events.
""The more successful we are at that, in theory, the less painful recovery is and the less costimpacted recovery is as we go through fire -- because we know we're going to go through more fire,"" White said.
Grand County commissioners were in support and willing to contribute some staff time to the effort.
In a separate workshop, Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin reviewed county regulations related to fire restrictions. With Grand seeing below-average snowpack, the upcoming fire season could be another demanding one.
""We anticipate, based on trends of the past, that this year will be busy as well,"" Schroetlin said.

The sheriff met with fire and police chiefs, along with the Grand County Wildfire Counsel and land partners like the Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service to review restriction processes. Part of the discussion focused on current penalties.
According to the current ordinance, a first-time violation of fire restrictions results in a $100 fine.
""There's really no sting with that,"" Schroetlin said. ""Coming off the season we had last year, I definitely think that needs to change.""
Schroetlin explained that agencies agreed that increasing the first offense penalty to $500 would better deter violations. For repeat offenses, the recommendation was to refer the case to a judge who could fine the individual up to $1,000.
Schroetlin said that the Forest Service writes a lot of tickets, estimating them at 100 per year. The sheriff added that ticketing is based on officer discretion, and tickets aren't necessarily issued in every situation. The sheriff's office wrote three tickets for fire restriction violations in 2020.
Adjusting fines will mean revising the county's ordinance on fire restrictions, which will include public notice and hearings. The commissioners instructed staff to begin that process.
Another recommendation related to exploding targets, which are currently prohibited in stage two fire restrictions. Agencies agreed that when used outside the manufacturer's directions the material poses a large fire risk.
Schroetlin's recommendation was to move exploding targets to stage one restrictions. A couple county residents spoke up in defense of exploding targets, the most popular of which is T annerite, pointing out that the material had never caused a fire in Grand County.
Commissioner Rich Cimino spoke in favor of moving exploding targets to stage one restrictions, while commissioners Kris Manguso and Merrit Linke leaned toward keeping it in stage two as long as the material is used according to the manufacture's specifications.
Adjusting what items are in the various stages of fire restrictions does not require an ordinance revision and is instead determined by a yearly resolution that will be passed in the coming months. The commissioners said they remained open to additional information on exploding targets before making their decision.

Grizzly_Creek_Fire_advances_into_No_Name_canyon___Post_Independent_Glenwood_Springs_CO___August_13_2020.txt,"Grizzly Creek Fire advance s into No Name canyo n, - Po st Inde p e nde nt (Gle nwo o d Springs, CO ) - August 13, 2020
The Grizzly Creek Fire burning in Glenwood Canyon grew to more than 4,600 acres with no containment Wednesday, mostly advancing to the west into the No Name Creek drainage, fire incident command team members said during an evening Facebook live community meeting.
That is cause for concern for the northern sections of Glenwood Springs. If the fire jumps the creek, parts of town north of Interstate 70 would be put on pre-evacuation notice.
""So far, we have been able to keep (the fire) on the east side of No Name Creek,"" said Jared Hohn, deputy incident commander with the Rocky Mountain Type 2 Blue Incident Management Team, which took over fire management on Wednesday.
As of that evening, there was not a pre-evacuation notice for Glenwood Springs, he and Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario clarified during the video session that allowed people to ask questions via live chat.
Full evacuation orders remain in place for the No Name neighborhood south and north of I-70 in the canyon, as well as Lookout Mountain, Homestead Estates, Bair Ranch, High Aspen Ranch, Coulter Creek, Cottonwood Pass and Spring Valley Ranch south of the current fire area.
Live news conferences and community meetings are not possible with the COVID-19 pandemic health precautions in place, White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams said.
While it would be ideal to do the evening fire updates and answer questions in person, Fitzwilliams said the internet-based format will have to do. There will be a Facebook live update every other day at 6 p.m., with the next one on Friday evening.
""We know we have a real situation here, and it's serious,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""This fire is in a really tough spot, and it's really tough to fight. And, it's causing all of us a lot of consternation and a lot of pain.
""As a team, we want to be as transparent as possible and provide as much information that we possibly can,"" he said.
The fire was to be handed over to a more highly trained and experienced Type 1 Incident Command team on Thursday, Fitzwilliams said.
The Grizzly Creek Fire started in the highway median along Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon near the Grizzly Creek recreation area about 1:30 p.m. Monday. The cause remains under investigation.
I-70 is closed indefinitely in both directions through the canyon between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum. Motorists are being advised by the Colorado Department of Transportation to take
alternate routes to the south via connecting highways to U.S. 50 or north to U.S. 40.
Highway 82 east over Independence Pass was closed Wednesday for as long as I-70 remains closed, after several semis became stuck on the narrow pass, where vehicles over 35 feet long are not allowed. The backcountry dirt road over Cottonwood Pass was also closed and is now part of the fire evacuation area.
The fire continues to burn on both the north and south sides of Glenwood Canyon, after it jumped to the south across I-70, the Colorado River and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks and up the steep cliffs to the south Tuesday afternoon. The UP line has been shut down, and Amtrak trains that normally run through Glenwood Springs have been diverted north through Wyoming.
On Wednesday, most of the fire activity was on the northwest flank, while there was not as much significant spread to the north, east and south, Hohn said.
""Right now, the fire is sitting in the bottom by No Name trail,"" he said.
Hohn also described the current fire conditions in the context of the summer of 2018 when the Lake Christine Fire north of Basalt burned more than 12,500 acres on Basalt Mountain, consuming three homes when it jumped a ridge into the El Jebel community on the evening of July 4.
""That was a big fire season, and there were numerous large fires,"" Hohn said. ""This here is shadowing the 2018 year. Nationally, we're at preparedness level four and resources are getting spread thin.""
The Grizzly Creek Fire remains the highest-priority fire in the country, due to the I-70 closure. The freeway serves as the main east-west thoroughfare through Colorado.
The biggest concerns as the Type 1 team takes command will be public safety, protection of firefighters, and protection of structures and infrastructure, said Marty Adell, who was to take over incident command on Thursday.
""We will try to do our best to protect people's livelihoods and homes,"" he said, ""and to reopen the I70 corridor. We recognize the transportation and commerce needs of doing that.""
Ground crews on Wednesday were working structure protection south of the fire area, and at the Shoshone hydroelectric power plant in Glenwood Canyon.
Moisture levels in the fire area are at record low levels, Adell said.
""We have not seen the normal precipitation we have this time of year,"" he said. ""That monsoon pattern has not materialized in any way whatsoever.""
Vallario said law enforcement officials assisted with evacuations in the No Name, Lookout Mountain and northern Spring Valley areas. If a pre-evacuation notice comes for parts of Glenwood Springs, he said that means it's time to plan and decide what to have ready to take in case of an evacuation and to make plans for accommodations should that occur.
""A pre-evacuation is just letting people know to be prepared, and that next message could very well be an evacuation order,"" he said. ""It's about pre-planning. What's valuable to take, like medications, pets, clothing, the basic, essential stuff.""
Brian Scott, who served as the public information officer for the fire on Wednesday, said that firefighting teams work with local public lands managers and other local officials to determine what areas within the forest or BLM lands are also high priority for protecting.
Hanging Lake, for instances, sits just a few miles to the northeast of the fire area, and as a national landmark and popular visitor destination, would likely meet the criteria.
""Given the way the fire is moving, there has likely been some spread toward Hanging Lake,"" Scott said earlier in the day Wednesday. At the same time, there are several ridges and gulches inbetween that would serve as natural fire breaks, he said.
""It's certainly something to be concerned about, especially with these windy days,"" Scott said. ""But we also have to balance that resource protection with the safety of firefighters.""

In his final address to those following the Grizzly Creek Fire , Jeff Surber with the Great Basin Incident Management Team said there has been much success containing the fire in recent days.
Surber and the Great Basin team facilitated a routine transfer of management on the fire to the Alaska Interagency Incident Management Team on Tuesday; Surber said as that team takes command on Wednesday, they expect containment levels will be near 50%.
The Grizzly Creek Fire, which started August 10 and has burned 32,060 acres, now appears to be ""in mighty good shape,"" Alaska team Incident Commander Tom Kurth told the community in a Facebook live broadcast on Tuesday.
""Our job is to organize the nearly 800 individuals here, and then we build them into a daily plan, keep them and you safe, protect your homes and community , your utility infrastructure, keep the roads and highways open, assist initial attack, and then build upon the work that this Great Basin team has left us with,"" Kurth said.
The Great Basin team ""has built certain expectations here,"" Kurth added. ""Work-wise, informationwise, and certainly working with cooperators here. So if we overlook something, let us know and we'll provide corrective behavior here.""
Dangerous areas remain
Surber said as the Alaska team attempts to wrap up the fire, challenges could occur in containing certain areas where the risk of standing dead trees, or snags, make it dangerous for firefighters to fight the fire on the ground. The Great Basin team has set up alternative plans to deal with those areas.
""We're kind of letting things take their own course in there, keeping people watching it, so if it tries to escape, we can jump on it and take action,"" Surber said.
For these areas, where wildfires can smolder for weeks before popping up again, Surber offered a warning .
""My understanding is they've had fires here that they've considered contained, or that they've pretty much laid down for a month, and then the fuel continues to dry out into September or even October, and an edge like that will have one tree fall over and then what happens is that fuel that's not ready to burn now -- we can't light it on fire because there's just enough fuel moisture not to carry fire well, but in another month, if you don't get rain, it will burn readily.""
Surber said a pre-constructed contingency fire line further up the slope, from where fighters can keep tabs on the snag-heavy areas, will prove helpful in those areas in the coming weeks.
""It's a watching game,"" Surber said. ""Or, if you get to the point where you have a big wind storm -- 50 mile-per-hour winds -- and everything blows down, and they start feeling comfortable that the weak trees all blew over already, they might walk in there.""
Rain possible
Surber said rain could also affect the outcome of certain areas of the fire in the days to come.
While the fire burned on the west side of Eagle County on Tuesday, the east side of the county enjoyed downpour conditions for about an hour.
Meteorologist Kris Sanders with the National Weather Service in Grand Junction said similar rainstorms could pop up over the next few days, but areas of higher elevation than the Grizzly Creek Fire are likely to see more rain.
""We've had a lot of moisture, some of this high pressure that's been meandering around the Four Corners region, so we just happened to be in a good fetch over the past couple of days, where moisture has been moving into the area,"" said Kris Sanders with the National Weather Service.
The storms have been accompanied by lightning, which has created spot fires in the area in recent days. The most recent suspected lightning fire occurred on Tuesday northeast of Rifle, said White River National Forest Deputy Forest Supervisor Lisa Stoeffler.
Stoeffler said the new fire is roughly 5 to 10 acres in size.
""We have ground crews on it, and helicopters on it, and expect that they are going to pay attention to that through the evening,"" she said. ""We'll chase after those lightning fires as they pop up, and use the team as available to help us with that.""
Stoeffler also urged locals and visitors to be extra cautious with fire .
""T hings are tinder dry and resources are stretched way too tight to be dealing with another fire,"" she said.

The Grizzly Creek Fire in Glenwood Canyon has many people praying for rain. But the very thing that could douse the blaze, which has burned 32,000 acres as of Tuesday, has some experts concerned it could also create problems for downstream endangered fish.
A heavy rain could wash dirt -- no longer held in place by charred vegetation -- and ash from the steep canyons and gullies of the burn area into the Colorado River. Scorched soils don't absorb water as well, increasing the magnitude of the flood. And the heavy sediment load in the runoff could suffocate fish. A similar scenario played out in 2018 when thousands of fish were killed by ash and dirt that washed into the Animas River from the 416 Fire burn area.
Downstream from the Grizzly Creek Fire , beginning in DeBeque Canyon, is critical habitat for four species of endangered fish: humpback chub, Colorado pikeminnow, bonytail and razorback sucker.
""Yes, we are very concerned about a fire in that kind of terrain that close to critical habitat. There's just no question,"" said Tom Chart, director of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program. ""There's a probability we could have an effect all the way down into the 15-mile reach.""
The Colorado River's so-called 15-mile reach, near Grand Junction, is home to those four species of fish. This stretch often has less water than is recommended for these fish by Fish & Wildlife mainly because of two large irrigation diversions that pull water from the river to irrigate Grand Valley farms: DeBeque Canyon's Grand Valley Project, which takes water from the river at a structure known as the Roller Dam, and the Grand Valley Irrigation Canal, which takes water from the river near Palisade.
Between these diversions and the confluence of the Gunnison River is a problem spot where water managers constantly work to bolster water levels through upstream reservoir releases. According to Chart, there is currently a total of about 250 cubic feet per second being released from Ruedi, Wolford and Granby reservoirs for the benefit of fish in the 15-mile reach.
With hot, dry weather, a weak monsoon and the ongoing diversions for irrigation season, which continue into the fall, current river conditions are already stressful for the fish, Chart said. Water managers say they have seen fish using fish ladders to swim upstream and downstream of the 15mile reach in search of deeper, cooler water.
""As far as concern about the ecological health of the 15-mile reach right now, we are very concerned about conditions there right now,"" Chart said. ""Native fish do move out of those dewatered stretches in search of better conditions.""
A debris flow on top of these already-challenging conditions could be devastating for fish populations.
""The potential with the Grizzly Creek Fire could be as bad as it gets if we get a rainstorm on top of a low baseflow,"" Chart said. ""You pray for rain, but at the same time this would be a tough time to get a flow of ash and retardant off the burned area.""
Burned area assessment begins
The U.S. Forest Service's Burned Area Emergency Response team has done a preliminary assessment of the severity of the soil burns to determine where debris flows would most likely occur, according to Lisa Stoeffler, deputy forest supervisor for the White River National Forest .
Areas of concern include Dead Horse Creek, Cinnamon Creek and No Name Creek, among others. More than an inch of rain in an hour -- or a quarter-inch in 15 minutes, as occurs in a fast-moving thunderstorm -- could trigger a debris flow, the BAER team found.
But this initial assessment, Stoeffler said, is mostly focused on potential impacts to Interstate 70, and water and power infrastructure, not on impacts to the aquatic environment.
""We may look at environment later on, once we have a final footprint of the fire,"" she said. ""The BAER process is really looking at things that we would need to address because it would cause an emergency-type situation.""
When the Grizzly Creek Fire first broke out, the City of Glenwood Springs switched its municipal water source from Grizzly and No Name creeks, which are near the burned area, to the Roaring Fork River.
""We are concerned about the ash and debris entering the water system and the costs we are going to incur because of this,"" said Hannah Klausman, public information officer for Glenwood Spring s.
Solution is dilution
Since preventing the dirty runoff from reaching the river would be difficult, if not impossible, in the steep, rocky terrain, the best bet, Chart said, would be tapping into upstream reservoir water to flush sediment and ash.
In other words: The solution to pollution is dilution.
The Roaring Fork River, which flows into the Colorado at Glenwood Springs, would also help dilute the ash and sediment before it got to the 15-mile reach. Some of it would probably settle out before it got there anyway. But that would do little to help native fish populations closer to the burn area. Although not listed as endangered, other species such as flannelmouth sucker, bluehead sucker and roundtail chub could also be impacted.
""We get concerned about the endangered fish the most, but it's really the entire native fish community we need to be paying attention to,"" Chart said.
The Colorado River Water Conservation District has some water in Wolford and Ruedi reservoirs
that could potentially be used for a flushing flow. But it would take careful coordination between reservoir operators. And it could be a complicated juggling act to figure out how to accommodate all the different demands for that limited water supply, said River District chief engineer John Currier.
""I think we stand ready to try and figure out how to do something,"" Currier said. ""It will be a topic of discussion sooner rather than later.""
Managing the impacts of the burned landscape on the fish will be ongoing long after the fire is exting uished.
""I think this is going to be an issue for years to come,"" Chart said. ""That landscape is going to take a long time to heal.""

The speed of the Grizzly Creek Fire has been substantially reduced over the past few days, and containment levels are expected to increase over the next few, officials said in a community meeting Saturday.
Amtrak trains have resumed travel through Glenwood Canyon, and Interstate 70 is expected to open in the coming days, as well, said Michael Goolsby, Colorado Department of Transportation's northwest region transportation director.
And while pre-evacuation orders are still in place for communities that have been preparing, officials are beginning to feel like that possibility isn't as likely anymore.
""We're getting more and more confident that it's not going to escape and get Dotsero, but we still want people to be prepared and keep in mind that something radical might happen,"" Eagle County Undersheriff Mike McWilliam said Saturday.
""We're enjoying some success,"" White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams echoed. ""But we're kind of moving into another phase of the fire.""
Fitzwilliams said next week's work will be focused on tying up each area of the fire .
""It's less of the craziness that we all had to deal with in the early stages of it, and more of a grind,"" Fitzwilliams said.
New management coming
The fire also will see a transition in management next week as Great Basin National Incident Management Team No. 1, which assumed command of the Grizzly Creek firefighting efforts on Aug. 13, will hand over operations to the Alaska Interagency Incident Management Team.
Fitzwilliams said management transitions during large incidents like the Grizzly Creek Fire are a normal part of the response.
""It's pretty seamless,"" Fitzwilliams said.
The Forest Service performed an assessment to determine what kind of management would need to follow the Great Basin team, and concluded that another top-tier response team, known as a ""Type-1"" team, would need to follow the Great Basin team. There are currently 16 national Type-1 incident management teams operating in the U.S., including the Great Basin and the Alaska teams.
""We generally go a 14-day tour,"" said Marty Adell with the Great Basin team.
During a typical turnover, Adell said the teams will spend a day or two working together to share important priorities and information.
""We want to make sure we get to the end of this fire in a safe, manageable and efficient way,"" he said.
Adell said the Great Basin team will be in Colorado through Tuesday, and the Alaska team is currently in transit to the area.
""They are incredibly experienced,"" Adell said of the Alaska team. ""So you are in very good hands.""
The next Grizzly Creek Fire community meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday at 6 p.m. on the Grizzly Creek Fire Facebook page; viewers will have a chance to hear from the incident commander for the new Alaska team at that meeting.
""We will have a close-out Wednesday morning, the 26th, and at that point we will travel home for a couple days off,"" Adell said.

The Grizzly Creek Fire in Glenwood Canyon became the highest-priority fire in the United States on Tuesday, driven by hot, windy weather through a virtual tinderbox of dry vegetation, forcing evacuations and keeping Interstate 70 closed at least through Wednesday and possibly longer.
The fire, which started in the median of I-70 near the Grizzly Creek recreation area early Monday afternoon, was the top fire -fighting concern among numerous fires burning throughout the West, due to the extended closure of Colorado's main east-west thoroughfare.
By Tuesday afternoon, the fire had jumped the Colorado River to the south side of Glenwood Canyon and had burned roughly 3,200 acres, according to an update Tuesday evening from the incident command team. It was 0% contained.
A total of 211 personnel were working the fire, which will be handed over to a Type 2 Incident Management team early Wednesday.
A fleet of firefighting aircraft was also working the fire from above, including two Very Large Air Tankers (VLAT ), multiple Large Air Tankers, four heavy helicopters and one medium helicopter, said David Boyd, public information officer with the Upper Colorado Interagency Fire Management Unit.
Afternoon winds shifted and pushed the fire to the west into the No Name drainage and across the river to the south, and residents in the unincorporated neighborhood of No Name were evacuated. Not long after that, an evacuation notice was given to residents on nearby Lookout Mountain just east of Glenwood Springs.
Interstate 70 was to remain closed between mile points 116 (Glenwood Springs) and 140 (Gypsum) through the night Tuesday, with the possibility of an extended closure through the week, the Colorado Department of Transportation is advising.
Evacuations and closures
* Cottonwood Pass Road in Eagle and Garfield counties is closed
* Interstate 70 remains closed between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum. No estimated time to reopen. Visit http://www.cotrip.org for road closure information.
* Coffee Pot Road, T ransfer Trail and Clinetop Mesa roads are closed, as are much of the lands of BLM and Forest Service in those areas. Closure maps are available on inciweb.
* The No Name, Lookout Mountain and Coulter Creek community east of Glenwood Springs were evacuated. Evacuated residents can go to Glenwood Springs Community Center.
* Fire Restrictions: All jurisdictions in the area are under Stage 1 fire restrictions and will move to Stage 2 on Thursday.
* Grizzly Creek Fire stats: Size  3,200 acres; Containment  0 %; Personnel total  211
""Hot, dry weather combined with dry fuels and a windy afternoon pushed the Grizzly Creek Fire in multiple directions,"" Boyd said in a Tuesday night news release. ""The fire crossed the Colorado River and Interstate 70 this afternoon, establishing itself on the south side.
""Firefighters are conducting preparation work in the evacuated communities and Shoshone Power Plant, evaluating structures and helping create defensible space where practical,"" Boyd said.
The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but is believed to be related to passing traffic on the interstate.
The city of Glenwood Springs on Tuesday also shut off the No Name water diversion source and is pumping water from the Roaring Fork River pump station due to the Grizzly fire.
""This is out of an abundance of caution to protect the water supply from fire retardant being used on the Grizzly Creek Fire in Glenwood Canyon,"" city officials said in a news release. ""Residents are asked to refrain from watering lawns for the next 48 hours. Additional restrictions may be issued later.""
No Name is home to about 80 households. Residents there also were advised not to drink the water in their neighborhood while evacuations were under way, as the water system there was switched over to the creek surface water, neighborhood association board member Sherry Caloia said.
EVACUAT IONS ORDERED
This is the second time Caloia said she can remember being evacuated from the No Name neighborhood because of a wildfire. The first one was several years ago when a fire burned up the hillside on the Glenwood side of the No Name T unnels ""about 10 or 15 years ago,"" she said.
""We had to do it yesterday (Monday) and again today,"" Caloia said. ""There's not a lot you can do. You just get in the car and go. I have no idea what to save, but I've got myself, my computer, the dogs, the cat...""
Evacuees from No Name and the more sparsely populated Lookout Mountain area up Red Canyon Road were directed to an evacuation center at the Glenwood Springs Community Center. Most were finding other accommodations in town with friends and such, including Caloia.
""It was pretty orderly in No Name,"" she said. ""Some people were working and couldn't get back right away, so they were pretty worried.""
On Monday as the fire broke out, visitors to the Hanging Lake area had to be evacuated.
""Our number one goal was to get everyone off the trail as soon as we heard about the fire , because it's a 45-minute hike back down,"" said Ken Murphy, co-owner of H2O Ventures, which runs the Hanging Lake hiking permit reservation system.
Hanging Lake is currently limited to 200 visitors per day due to the COVID-19 restrictions, and no shuttle is in service.
Once hikers got to the trailhead parking lot, CDOT crews worked to get about 30 motorists redirected onto eastbound I-70. There's only a westbound entrance to I-70 from Hanging Lake, Murphy noted.
""We have an emergency plan in place for just something like this, and it worked,"" he said. ""We were cleared and done pretty quickly, and got everyone out safe.""
Murphy said he has had to cancel 960 reservations through Friday.
I-70 SAFET Y CLOSURE CONT INUES
The I-70 safety closure remains in effect until further notice not only to aid firefighting efforts, but to allow CDOT crews to assess two bridges located near where the Grizzly Creek Fire started on Monday.
There is also now increased rockfall hazard in Glenwood Canyon.
""Rockfall has been reported and is likely due to burned vegetation no longer holding rocks in place,"" CDOT advised Tuesday morning.
Cross-state traffic is still advised to take detour routes to the south via U.S. 50, 24 and 285, and to the north via U.S. 40 and Colorado 139 or 13.
""CDOT has paused some construction projects to allow for detour traffic,"" according to the Tuesday news release.
Cottonwood Pass between Garfield and Eagle counties was closed Tuesday morning after a semi overturned around 3 a.m. when the driver attempted to navigate the steep, narrow, dirt road.
Eagle County Emergency Management Director Birch Barron advised county commissioners in a morning briefing Tuesday that, when Cottonwood Pass reopens, only smaller vehicles capable of maneuvering the tight roadway should attempt the route.
""And you can expect some serious traffic,"" he said.
CDOT says to avoid Cottonwood Pass altogether, except for local traffic only.
""CDOT asks that motorists not use Cottonwood Pass or Independence Pass as detour routes, as these roads are not built for heavy traffic or commercial oversize vehicles,"" CDOT said in its latest release.
One large truck, hauling for Amazon, flipped on its side on the Garfield County side of the pass in the early-morning hours Tuesday.
The truck was scheduled to be hauled off the pass Tuesday evening, but T rooper Jacob Best with the Colorado State Patrol wrote in an email that the recovery of the tractor-trailer had been called off for safety reasons. The timeframe for when it will be recovered is uncertain.
Vehicles over 35 feet in length, including semi-tractor trailers, are prohibited on Independence Pass at any time. The restriction also includes a vehicle and trailer that, together, exceed 35 feet, CDOT advises.

MID-MORNING T HURSDAY UPDAT E
From Incident Command: Today's weather and fire behavior is expected to be similar to Wednesday's, with active fire behavior and Red Flag Warning conditions due to gusty winds and low relative humidity.
On Wednesday afternoon, the fire reached the bottom of the No Name drainage, which will be a focus of firefighters today. Hotshot crews are working to contain spot fires along the ridge south of No Name drainage, and establish an anchor point and firelines.
""Residents in north Glenwood Springs should be prepared for rapidly changing conditions that may lead to pre-evacuation notices,"" according to the Thursday morning update. Evacuation information is posted on the Garfield County website at http://www.Garfield-county.com.
Firefighters continue to do structure protection in several locations around the fire including the Shoshone Power Plant, Lookout Mountain, and the No Name subdivision.
""The fire is also fairly active on the east side, near Deadman's Gulch, where crews are working to keep fire from spotting across I-70 in additional locations. Heavy equipment is working in more accessible areas. Helicopters and airtankers are supporting the efforts of engines and ground crews.""
Great Basin Type 1 Team, Incident Commander Marty Adell assumed command of the Grizzly Creek Fire at 6 a.m. Thursday.
Daily operations video updates will be posted on the Grizzly Creek Fire Facebook page. Maps and other information will also be posted on inciweb at https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6942/.
The team will host its next virtual FaceBook live community meeting at 6 p.m. Friday.
Road Closures: I-70 between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum, with no estimated time for reopening; Cottonwood Pass Road in Garfield and Eagle counties and Independence Pass are closed; Coffee Pot Road, T ransfer Trail and Clinetop Mesa roads and areas of the Flattops accessed by those roads are also closed, as well as many surrounding White River National Forest and BLM roads. Maps of the closures are available on Inciweb.
NEW FIRE AREA MAP: Fire Incident Command has provided a current map of the Grizzly Creek Fire. The fire is currently 6,250 acres.
Original story:
The Grizzly Creek Fire burning in Glenwood Canyon grew to more than 4,600 acres with no
containment Wednesday, mostly advancing to the west into the No Name Creek drainage, fire incident command team members said during an evening Facebook live community meeting.
That is cause for concern for the northern sections of Glenwood Springs. If the fire jumps the creek, parts of town north of Interstate 70 would be put on pre-evacuation notice.
""So far, we have been able to keep (the fire) on the east side of No Name Creek,"" said Jared Hohn, deputy incident commander with the Rocky Mountain Type 2 Blue Incident Management Team, which took over fire management on Wednesday.
As of that evening, there was not a pre-evacuation notice for Glenwood Springs, he and Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario clarified during the video session that allowed people to ask questions via live chat.
Full evacuation orders remain in place for the No Name neighborhood south and north of I-70 in the canyon, as well as Lookout Mountain, Homestead Estates, Bair Ranch, High Aspen Ranch, Coulter Creek, Cottonwood Pass and Spring Valley Ranch south of the current fire area.
Live news conferences and community meetings are not possible with the COVID-19 pandemic health precautions in place, White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams said.
While it would be ideal to do the evening fire updates and answer questions in person, Fitzwilliams said the internet-based format will have to do. There will be a Facebook live update every other day at 6 p.m., with the next one on Friday evening.
""We know we have a real situation here, and it's serious,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""This fire is in a really tough spot, and it's really tough to fight. And, it's causing all of us a lot of consternation and a lot of pain.
""As a team, we want to be as transparent as possible and provide as much information that we possibly can,"" he said.
The fire was to be handed over to a more highly trained and experienced Type 1 Incident Command team on Thursday, Fitzwilliams said.
The Grizzly Creek Fire started in the highway median along Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon near the Grizzly Creek recreation area about 1:30 p.m. Monday. The cause remains under investigation.
I-70 is closed indefinitely in both directions through the canyon between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum. Motorists are being advised by the Colorado Department of Transportation to take alternate routes to the south via connecting highways to U.S. 50 or north to U.S. 40.
Highway 82 east over Independence Pass was closed Wednesday for as long as I-70 remains closed, after several semis became stuck on the narrow pass, where vehicles over 35 feet long are not allowed. The backcountry dirt road over Cottonwood Pass was also closed and is now part of the fire evacuation area.
The fire continues to burn on both the north and south sides of Glenwood Canyon, after it jumped to the south across I-70, the Colorado River and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks and up the steep cliffs to the south Tuesday afternoon. The UP line has been shut down, and Amtrak trains that normally run through Glenwood Springs have been diverted north through Wyoming.
On Wednesday, most of the fire activity was on the northwest flank, while there was not as much significant spread to the north, east and south, Hohn said.
""Right now, the fire is sitting in the bottom by No Name trail,"" he said.
Hohn also described the current fire conditions in the context of the summer of 2018 when the Lake Christine Fire north of Basalt burned more than 12,500 acres on Basalt Mountain, consuming three homes when it jumped a ridge into the El Jebel community on the evening of July 4.
""That was a big fire season, and there were numerous large fires,"" Hohn said. ""This here is shadowing the 2018 year. Nationally, we're at preparedness level four and resources are getting spread thin.""
The Grizzly Creek Fire remains the highest-priority fire in the country, due to the I-70 closure. The freeway serves as the main east-west thoroughfare through Colorado.
The biggest concerns as the Type 1 team takes command will be public safety, protection of firefighters, and protection of structures and infrastructure, said Marty Adell, who was to take over incident command on Thursday.
""We will try to do our best to protect people's livelihoods and homes,"" he said, ""and to reopen the I70 corridor. We recognize the transportation and commerce needs of doing that.""
Ground crews on Wednesday were working structure protection south of the fire area, and at the Shoshone hydroelectric power plant in Glenwood Canyon.
Moisture levels in the fire area are at record low levels, Adell said.
""We have not seen the normal precipitation we have this time of year,"" he said. ""That monsoon pattern has not materialized in any way whatsoever.""
Vallario said law enforcement officials assisted with evacuations in the No Name, Lookout Mountain and northern Spring Valley areas. If a pre-evacuation notice comes for parts of Glenwood Springs, he said that means it's time to plan and decide what to have ready to take in case of an evacuation and to make plans for accommodations should that occur.
""A pre-evacuation is just letting people know to be prepared, and that next message could very well be an evacuation order,"" he said. ""It's about pre-planning. What's valuable to take, like medications, pets, clothing, the basic, essential stuff.""
Brian Scott, who served as the public information officer for the fire on Wednesday, said that firefighting teams work with local public lands managers and other local officials to determine what
areas within the forest or BLM lands are also high priority for protecting.
Hanging Lake, for instances, sits just a few miles to the northeast of the fire area, and as a national landmark and popular visitor destination, would likely meet the criteria.
""Given the way the fire is moving, there has likely been some spread toward Hanging Lake,"" Scott said earlier in the day Wednesday. At the same time, there are several ridges and gulches inbetween that would serve as natural fire breaks, he said.
""It's certainly something to be concerned about, especially with these windy days,"" Scott said. ""But we also have to balance that resource protection with the safety of firefighters.""

Over the weekend, the Grizzly Creek Fire became the largest in the history of the White River National Forest as far as acres burned.
As of Sunday morning, the fire had burned 20,665 acres of national forest out of a total burn area of 25,690 acres in just six days, according to U.S. Forest Service data. The additional acres are on Bureau of Land Management grounds or private property.
The next largest conflagration was the Big Fish Fire in the Flattops north of Glenwood Springs in 2002. It burned 16,912 acres of national forest and totaled 17,056.
The Lake Christine Fire, which threatened Basalt, El Jebel and part of Missouri Heights in July 2018, burned 8,506 acres of national forest and a total of 12,588 acres. It ranks as the fifth-largest fire in the White River's history.
White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams said the Grizzly Crveek Fire erupted so significantly because of hot, dry and windy conditions and because firefighting in the early stages was so difficult verus the steep, inaccessible terrain.
""Once it left the median of the highway, it was off to the races,"" Fitzwilliams said Sunday. ""There was no way to fight it.""
The fire started in the median of Interstate 70 on Monday afternoon, climbed the steep slopes to the north and later in the week jumped the Colorado River and made a run in the terrain to the south.
It's ripped through terrain that was inaccessible to firefighters. Air tankers and helicopters dropped numerous loads of retardant and water but that only slowed the growth. The fire is now approaching fire lines on both sides of the river, but there is still potential for extensive growth in acreage, according to Fitzwilliams.
""The north fire front is 10 miles wide now,"" he noted.
The Forest Service data show that seven of the top 10 largest fires in the White River area have occurred since 2002. Fitzwilliams said that is more than a coincidence.
""It's warmer and drier due to the changing climate,"" he said. ""I'm not an expert on that, but the data is there.""
The White River National Forest , which covers 2.3 million acres, historically has avoided larger wildfires because of its high elevation and ample precipitation.
""Internally (at the Forest Service), the White River National Forest was known as the 'asbestos
forest ,'"" Fitzwilliams said. That was a testament to the low number and small nature of its fires.
Those days might be behind it. Much of the 2.3 million-acre forest is experiencing severe or moderate drought this year, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. It's the second drought in three years. Extremely dry conditions in 2002 also produced several large fires in Colorado and the western United States.
""What's significant is this area of Colorado for a length of time hasn't seen big fires,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""We've talked a lot as a team about how people are starting to see things change here, on the White River team. It's important for our communities to understand that this is something we're going to have to prepare for on a more frequent basis than what we've been accustomed to.""
The snowpack was slightly above average last winter. However, the fall was much warmer and drier than average, so ground moisture levels were low heading into winter. A hot, windy spring consumed the snowpack and the summer monsoons never materialized. That's created conditions in the forest that are ripe for wildfire.
Assuming the trend continues for more frequent and more intense fires, the firefighting effort also will become more challenging because of Colorado's growth explosion. Many of the most coveted places for development are in what's technically known as the wildland-urban interface. In practical terms, it's a house in or at the edge of the woods.
""We're going to deal with the consequences of that,"" Fitzwilliams said.
So what's it mean for public land managers? Fitzwilliams said the White River staff has to plan more fuel reduction projects, such as prescribed burns. Several hundred acres of a prescribed burn prior to the Lake Christine Fire clearly slowed the spread of the fire into heavily populated Missouri Heights, Fitzwilliams said.
He is eager to see what effect a prescribed burn in the French Creek area of the Flattops has on the Grizzly Creek Fire .
The White River also has worked on logging projects to reduce fuel loads. That doesn't always go over well with neighbors. One active lawsuit is challenging a logging project in the Upper Fryingpan River Valley.
Fitzwilliams said the Forest Service must make a better case for the projects -- effectively telling the public why it feels it needs to pursue the work.
But prescribed burns and logging aren't going to occur in the wildland-urban interface. Fire would be too great of threat to homes. Logging would be logistically difficult. So, towns and individual homeowners have to get better at creating defensible space around structures.
""As communities and homeowners, we're woefully behind,"" Fitzwilliams said.
For forest visitors, an increase in fires could bring more frequent closures of trails and sections of
forest for recreation and more frequent restrictions of campfires.
""This is not going away,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""It's part of living in this great (landscape).""

During the Grizzly Creek Fire virtual community meeting Sunday night, fire officials briefed Garfield, Eagle and Pitkin county area locals on various aspects of the team's suppression and containment strategies but one key takeaway message was clear: the wildfire is expected to continue to stay active and grow over the next several days.
""When we're talking about this fire specifically, I did not want to paint this rosy picture that everything's going to be grandiose, I want to make sure we know what we're looking at,"" said Marty Adell, incident commander on the fire.
""I want to let you know as the citizenry of this area that this fire will continue to burn for some time. There is a lot of fuel out there, the weather is setting up not exactly in our favor, but with great effort between the local community and the local resources ... we will continue to have progress forward, it just may take a little while.""
The Grizzly Creek Fire grew to 25,690 acres Sunday morning, and full suppression efforts continued with 625 personnel helping fight the fire .
And according to Adell, the Great Basin National Incident Management Team is up against several logistical, topographical and weather-related challenges with fighting the wildfire.
For one, much of the fire fuel -- which includes the live plants, trees and shrubs in the area as well as the dead grasses and brush littering the ground -- is very dry. T hroughout Colorado, the monsoon season that usually hits this time of year has been absent, resulting in very minimal precipitation, Adell said.
He also noted that the forecast for the next week or so is expected to include more dry, warm weather, as well as dry thunderstorms with the possibility of dry lightening and high, erratic winds.
""You will see some more fire growth and a lot of smoke for several days to a week or so,"" Adell said.
On Sunday, firefighters continued to implement structure protection around the Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park gondola and also worked to keep the fire south of Coffee Pot Road.
The fire team is utilizing hand crews or on-the-ground firefighters, bulldozers and engine crews where it can to reinforce its ""lines,"" or cleared breaks it aims to keep the fire from crossing. However, the steep terrain and active nature of the fire in parts also has led the team to rely on dropping lots of retardant to help contain the blaze, according to Jeff Surber, operations section chief on the fire.
Surber walked viewers through what crews were working on Sunday in each area around the fire using a 3D, topographic map, and said that the fire team greatly benefited Sunday from the less
windy weather conditions.
""The atypical part of this fire has been that the Glenwood Canyon topography. ... What that topography does is it mixes the winds in a way that really influences the ability for the fire to spot back and forth across the canyon,"" Surber said.
""The advance of the fire was limited by the weather really well today. We never got a real heavy wind on it, ... so today was a great day, we had just some really good success because of the weather.""
Surber and Adell were two of the various fire team leaders and tri-county area officials who spoke to the public at Sunday's community meeting, which fluctuated between 1,600 to 2,100 viewers.
William Basye, the fire's air resource adviser, spoke to air quality and the prevalence of wildfiresmoke in the tri-county area, advising that the air will generally be smokiest around 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and in the evening.
Eagle County Sheriff James Van Beek spoke to the importance of area residents to sign up for Eagle and Garfield County alerts and to have ""Ready, Set, Go"" plans in place in case they have to evacuate.
And Scott Fitzwilliams, supervisor of the White River National Forest , spoke to the great collaboration that's taken place to fight the fire along with the question most officials have been getting over the past several days from locals: when will I-70 between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum reopen?
Fitzwilliams said that the ultimate decision is up to the Colorado Department of Transportation and Colorado State Patrol, but that before they even get to that point, the fire teams have to be sure there is no active fire along the highway and have to clear any debris from the fire, like burned trees and rocks, that may be on the roadway -- which could take awhile. As of Sunday, there was no estimated time for reopening.
""We all want it to open and we recognize this is a huge, huge impact to our communities, to the West Slope, to economies, to commerce, and it's a really, really high priority,"" Fitzwilliams said.
""Having been through that canyon quite a few times, it's not safe right now, there's fire sometimes right up to the road, there are trees on fire right next to the road and there are firefighters and people moving up and down that need to do their jobs.""
Fitzwilliams also said the area immediately surrounding Hanging Lake still seems to be intact and that a Burned Area Emergency Response team will start assessing the fire 's more long-term impact on forest resources like watersheds and wildlife this week.
The next community meeting will be held virtually Tuesday at 6 p.m. To tune into the meeting in English, go to the Grizzly Creek Fire Facebook page. To tune into the meeting in Spanish, go to the Mi Salud, Mi Charco Facebook page.

There is also now increased rockfall hazard in Glenwood Canyon.
""Both assessments are taking place today. Rockfall has been reported and is likely due to burned vegetation no longer holding rocks in place,"" CDOT advised in a late morning press release.
T raffic is still advised to take detour routes to the south via U.S. 50, 24 and 285, and to the north via U.S. 40 and Colorado 139 or 13.
""CDOT has paused some construction projects to allow for detour traffic,"" according to the release.
Stay off Cottonwood and Independence passes
Cottonwood Pass between Garfield and Eagle counties was closed Tuesday morning after a semi overturned around 3 a.m. when the driver attempted to navigate the steep, narrow, dirt road.
Eagle County Emergency Management Director Birch Barron advised county commissioners in a morning briefing that when Cottonwood Pass reopens only smaller vehicles capable of maneuvering the tight roadway should attempt the route.
""And you can expect some serious traffic,"" he said.
CDOT says to avoid Cottonwood Pass altogether, except for local traffic only.
""CDOT asks that motorists not use Cottonwood Pass or Independence Pass as detour routes, as these roads are not built for heavy traffic or commercial oversize vehicles,"" CDOT said in its latest release.
Vehicles over 35 feet in length, including semi-tractor trailers, are prohibited on Independence Pass at any time. The restriction also includes a vehicle and trailer that, together, exceed 35 feet, CDOT advises.
UPDAT E 10:30 a.m. Tuesday -- More than 120 firefighters are now working the Grizzly Creek Fire, with more resources on the way, according to the latest update from the Upper Colorado Interagency Fire Management command.
""Firefighters are working to keep the fire out of the No Name drainage as well as on the north side of the Colorado River,"" according to the latest post. ""Terrain is very rugged, limiting where we can safely put firefighters on the ground.
""Crews are focusing on point protection in the No Name area on the west side, including accessing structures and prepping areas should the fire reach the area.""
The No Name area remains on pre-evacuation notice, and residents are asked to be prepared to leave in the event the fire moves in that direction.
Firefighting crews are also working on point protection in the Shoshone area to the east of the fire. Aircraft continues to be work the fire from above.
Firefighters are scouting areas for containment lines on top in the Flattops, and evacuating campers and other recreationists from the Coffee Pot Road area and other areas in the Forest Service closure area north of the fire.
The fire is still reported to be at 1,300 acres, but a more accurate acreage estimate was expected after a morning mapping flight.
""We expect fire activity to increase as the day warms and the humidity drops,"" according to the latest Facebook update.
The cause of the fire remains under investigation.Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon is to remain closed in both directions between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum until further notice due to the Grizzly Creek firefighting efforts.
""We will have more information after morning briefings. We do not have an estimated time for reopening,"" according to a Tuesday morning post to the official incident Facebook page.
Regular fire updates will be posted there, and the latest on the I-70 closures and suggested alternate routes can be found at http://www.cotrip.org.
The Colorado Department of Transportation advises that the backcountry Cottonwood Pass dirt road is not to be used as a bypass. The I-70 closure is also intended to allow for inspection of the elevated westbound section where the fire burned, and to check for rockfall hazards within the fire area.
""The fire was active last night,"" the latest post announced. ""The community of No Name is under pre-evacuation, which means residents should be ready to evacuate.""
The fire started at about 1:30 p.m. Monday in the median between the eastbound and the elevated westbound lanes near the Grizzly Creek rest area and hiking trail, five miles east of Glenwood Springs. It involved about 60 firefighters and numerous aircraft.
This is a developing story and will be updated.En Espanol

Containment lines on the Grizzly Creek Fire held during Monday's red-flag wind conditions, as firefighters were able to maintain the upper hand. As of Tuesday, the fire was 75% contained and did not grow in size, holding at 32,464 acres, according to the latest update from Incident Commander Norm McDonald.
The big concern Monday was strong afternoon wind gusts of up to 40 mph over parts of the fire, with the strongest winds between 8,000  11,000 feet, according to Incident Meteorologist Nathan H einert.
""Winds at lower elevations and in valleys weren't quite as strong,"" he said. ""A lot of the fire was protected, which is a good thing.""
Sixty of the approximately 80 miles of fire perimeter are now contained, according to the Tuesday morning update.
""Mother Nature provided a helping hand Monday night with a steady rain that dropped two-tenths of an inch of rain over most of the fire area,"" according to the report. Fortunately, the rain wasn'theavy enough to prompt any concerns about runoff or flash floods, Heinert said.
Work continues to build a control line in the upper No Name and Grizzly Creek drainages. T hree hotshot crews worked Monday to build hand line along the southwest of rim of Grizzly Creek, and fire managers are hoping to connect that line to No Name Creek today to secure the northwest edge of the fire.
An unmanned aerial system (aka drone) was used to inspect the two drainages on Monday.
""They looked really good,"" Alaska IMT Operations Section Chief Karen Scholl said. ""They weren't showing much heat at all.""
There are currently 589 personnel on the fire, plus six dozers, six excavators and two chippers working to rehab lines in the areas of Coffee Pot Road, Bair Ranch, Red Canyon and No Name.
The Forest Service announced the fire was human caused at a Facebook Live community meeting held in Eagle on Monday. The investigation into the specific cause will continue.
Other alerts
Interstate 70 remains open. Expect periodic delays for firefighting operations and possible flash floods in the event of heavy rain. Go to cotrip.org for information on interstate closures.
Road/trail closures remain in effect for Coffee Pot Road, T ransfer Trail Road and areas of the
Flattops Wilderness accessed by those roads, as do many surrounding White River National Forest and BLM roads. For maps and closure info, go to White River NF closure area or BLM closure order and closure map.

Grizzly_Creek_Fire_update_Investigators_determine__Eagle_Valley_Enterprise_CO___September_1_2020.txt,"Grizzly Creek Fire up date : Inve stigato rs de te rmine - Eagle Valle y Ente rp rise (CO ) - Se p te mbe r 1, 2020
It has been a productive seven days for fire crews working the Grizzly Creek fire , according to members of the Alaska Incident Management Team who spoke at Monday night's Facebook Live community information meeting.
But the past couple of days have brought significant weather challenges as crews battled the blaze that has burned 32,464 acres -- nearly 51 square miles -- since it was sparked Aug. 10 on the median of Interstate 70 near the Grizzly Creek rest area. The fire now stands at 73% containment. And, officially, investigators have determined the fire was ""human-caused.""
Lisa Stoeffler, deputy supervisor of the White River National Forest , did not say if it was because of a cigarette being thrown out a window, a trailer chain dragging and creating sparks, or another ignition source, only that the determination was based on where the fire started and the fact there were no lightning strikes in the area at that time. The fire started about 1:30 p.m. on that Monday and quickly moved up the north side of Glenwood Canyon.
""We're going to continue to keep that investigation open, but what I can share at this point is our investigators have concluded the fire is human-caused. I think many people realize there wasn't lightning in the area at that time, and it was started directly adjacent to the interstate in the median,"" Stoeffler said Monday night. ""Now, there are a couple of things that could cause that. We don't have the exact cause of the fire yet, but we know it's human-caused.""
Fuel, topography and weather are the three elements that feed a fire and beginning Sunday, weather was a bigger factor for the Grizzly Creek blaze. According to the official U.S. Forest Service Grizzly Creek Fire incident page, winds that generated gusts of up to 40 mph created concerns on the fireline Sunday and Monday.
""Today was what we call a test day,"" said Chris Moore, a U.S Forest Service fire behavior analyst. But even when the winds picked up, he noted, firelines held.
On Sunday, the Forest Service reported that crews were pulled off the line at 2 p.m. due to the sudden turn in the weather. Windy conditions that lasted approximately an hour threatened to topple fire-weakened trees. Along with the wind, lightning strikes created a dangerous situation for firefighters, but no incidents or injuries were reported and firefighters were able to return to the line about an hour later after the storm passed.
The Forest Service reports that fire managers have focused efforts on an uncontained edge on the fire's northwest corner in the No Name and Grizzly Creek drainages, about 10 miles northeast of Glenwood Springs. T hree hotshot crews are working to connect two sections of open line -- one working north along No Name Creek and the other two working back toward them from Grizzly Creek.
Elsewhere around the fire, crews continued to seek and destroy hot spots. Crews are also still
trying to secure a rugged, twisty stretch of uncontained line on the south side of the fire near Green Lake. Crews have secured approximately 60 of the 80 miles of containment line and mop-up operations are ongoing.
There are 626 personnel currently working the fire.
T raffic test
Sunday provided a learning opportunity for fire teams and Colorado Department of Transportation workers when an accident occurred along Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon.
""Within a matter of minutes, we had a plan to minimize that risk,"" said Norm McDonald, incident commander of the Alaska team.
Don Poole from CDOT concurred. While traffic behind the accident was stopped for an extended time, the accident demonstrated that an evacuation of the canyon could be accomplished in 20 minutes, Poole said.
Poole also reported that CDOT personnel have completed an aerial reconnaissance of the I-70 corridor through the burn area and plan to review the data to determine additional rockfall mitigation needs. If additional work is required, it will be completed this fall, Poole said.
He added that the rest areas in the canyon remain closed, both as a practical matter because water and wastewater service must be re-established, and as a safety issue. Right now there are firefighter camps in the rest area locations but beyond that, local emergency management officials want to make sure that a debris slide or flash flood situation doesn't turn into a search and rescue mission because of recreational users in the area.
Wildlife issues
In response to community concerns about the fire 's effect on local wildlife and upcoming hunting seasons, Matt Yamashita of Colorado Parks and Wildlife was one of the featured speakers at Monday's meeting.
""Animals have an instinctive ability to evade anything that Mother Nature throws at them,"" said Yamashita. He pointed to the experiences of the 2018 Lake Christine Fire, noting that there were no large populations of animals killed in the blaze.
Fire is more of a temporary stress for wildlife, he said, and animals benefit from the aftermath.
""This fire is actually achieving some habitat management objectives,"" he said.
On social media, there has been suggestions to leave out buckets of water to assist animals fleeing the fire. That's not a good idea, Yamashita said.
""Artificially putting out food or water resources isn't the best thing for wildlife right now,"" he said, noting that within just a few weeks, nutritious green shoots of vegetation will be spouting in the
burn area.
As for the hunting impacts from the fire area closures, road closures remain in effect for Coffee Pot Road, T ransfer Trail Road and areas of the Flattops accessed by those roads along with many surrounding White River National Forest and BLM roads. Full information is available at www.cotrip.org. Yamashita said hunters who drew licenses in Game Unit 34, the area most affected by the Grizzly Creek Fire , have a refund option.
Affected hunters have until the day before their season is slated to start to make a refund request. For additional information, visit cpw.state.co.us or call 970-947-2920 for additional information.
What's next
According to McDonald, full suppression remains the goal for firefighting teams. Operations Chief John Glover said crews feel comfortable eastward expansion of the fire has been suppressed and teams will continue to work along the northern and south flanks of the blaze, although some of the terrain is not accessible firefighters.
Stoeffler noted that the Alaska team has been on the fire for six days now and at the end of the week, local Forest Service officials and the team leaders will evaluate where to go from there.
""I would expect we will still need some help managing this fire a week from now,"" said Stoeffler. ""We really want to get through this weather this week.""
The next Facebook Live community meeting is planned Thursday at 6 p.m.

GRIZZLY_CREEK_FIRE_UPDATE_Lack_of_wind_on_Sunday__Vail_Daily_CO___August_17_2020.txt,"GRIZZLY CREEK FIRE UPDAT E: Lack o f wind o n Sunday - Vail Daily (CO ) - August 17, 2020
Aug ust 17, 2020  Vail Daily (CO)  Maddie Vincent The Aspen Times
During the Grizzly Creek Fire virtual community meeting Sunday night, fire officials briefed Garfield, Eagle and Pitkin county area locals on various aspects of the team's suppression and containment strategies but one key takeaway message was clear: The wildfire is expected to continue to stay active and grow over the next several days.
""When we're talking about this fire specifically, I did not want to paint this rosy picture that everything's going to be grandiose, I want to make sure we know what we're looking at,"" said Marty Adell, incident commander on the fire.
""I want to let you know as the citizenry of this area that this fire will continue to burn for some time. There is a lot of fuel out there, the weather is setting up not exactly in our favor, but with great effort between the local community and the local resources ... we will continue to have progress forward, it just may take a little while.""
The Grizzly Creek Fire grew to 25,690 acres Sunday morning, and full suppression efforts continued with 625 personnel helping fight the fire .
And according to Adell, the Great Basin National Incident Management Team is up against several logistical, topographical and weather-related challenges with fighting the wildfire.
For one, much of the fire fuel -- which includes the live plants, trees and shrubs in the area as well as the dead grasses and brush littering the ground -- is very dry. T hroughout Colorado, the monsoon season that usually hits this time of year has been absent, resulting in very minimal precipitation, Adell said.
He also noted that the forecast for the next week or so is expected to include more dry, warm weather, as well as dry thunderstorms with the possibility of dry lightening and high, erratic winds.
""You will see some more fire growth and a lot of smoke for several days to a week or so,"" Adell said.
On Sunday, firefighters continued to implement structure protection around the Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park gondola and also worked to keep the fire south of Coffee Pot Road.
The fire team is utilizing hand crews or on-the-ground firefighters, bulldozers and engine crews where it can reinforce its ""lines,"" or cleared breaks it aims to keep the fire from crossing. However, the steep terrain and active nature of the fire in parts has also led the team to rely on dropping lots of retardant to help contain the blaze, according to Jeff Surber, operations section chief on the fire.
Surber walked viewers through what crews were working on Sunday in each area around the fire using a 3D, topographic map, and said that the fire team greatly benefited Sunday from the less
windy weather conditions.
""The atypical part of this fire has been that the Glenwood Canyon topography ... what that topography does is it mixes the winds in a way that really influences the ability for the fire to spot back and forth across the canyon,"" Surber said.
"" ... The advance of the fire was limited by the weather really well today. We never got a real heavy wind on it ... so today was a great day, we had just some really good success because of the weather.""
Surber and Adell were two of the various fire team leaders and tri-county area officials who spoke to the public at Sunday's community meeting, which fluctuated between 1,600 to 2,100 viewers.
William Basye, the fire's air resource advisor, spoke to air quality and the prevalence of wildfiresmoke in the tri-county area, advising that the air will generally be smokiest around 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and in the evening.
Eagle County Sheriff James van Beek spoke to the importance of area residents to sign up for Eagle and Garfield County alerts and to have ""Ready, Set Go"" plans in place in case they have to evacuate.
And Scott Fitzwilliams, supervisor of the White River National Forest spoke to the great collaboration that's taken place to fight the fire along with the question most officials have been getting over the past several days from locals: When will Interstate 70 between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum reopen?
Fitzwilliams said that the ultimate decision is up to the Colorado Department of Transportation and Colorado State Patrol, but that before they even get to that point, the fire teams have to be sure there is no active fire along the highway and has to clear any debris from the fire, like burned trees and rocks, that may be on the roadway -- which could take a while. As of Sunday, there was no estimated time for reopening.
""We all want it to open and we recognize this is a huge, huge impact to our communities, to the Western Slope, to economies, to commerce, and it's a really, really high priority,"" Fitzwilliams said.
""Having been through that canyon quite a few times it's not safe right now, there's fire sometimes right up to the road, there are trees on fire right next to the road and there are firefighters and people moving up and down that need to do their jobs.""
Fitzwilliams also said the area immediately surrounding Hanging Lake still seems to be intact and that a Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team will start assessing the fire 's more longterm impact on forest resources like watersheds and wildlife this week.
The next community meeting will be held virtually Tuesday at 6 p.m. To tune into the meeting in English, go to the Grizzly Creek Fire Facebook page. To tune into the meeting in Spanish, go to the Mi Salud, Mi Charco Facebook page.

Steady yet light rain overnight Monday was good for firefighting efforts on the Grizzly Creek Fire in Glenwood Canyon, and most importantly the ground held in the fragile burn scar area where the potential for debris flows will be an ongoing concern for some time.
""Mother Nature provided a helping hand Monday night with a steady rain that dropped two-tenths of an inch of rain over most of the fire area,"" said Nathan Heinert, meteorologist for the Alaska Type 1 Incident Management Team that's now in charge of the 23-day-old fire.
Fortunately, that rain wasn'theavy enough to prompt any concerns about runoff or flash floods, Heinert said in a Tuesday update on firefighting operations.
Earlier in the day Monday, the fire containment line that crews have been busy building since before the Alaska team arrived also held during high afternoon winds.
As of Tuesday, the fire was 75% contained and had not grown in size since Monday morning, holding at 32,464 acres, Incident Commander Norm McDonald said in the daily update.
Monday saw strong afternoon wind gusts of as fast as 40 mph over parts of the fire, with the strongest winds between 8,000 and 11,000 feet.
""Winds at lower elevations and in valleys weren't quite as strong,"" he said. ""A lot of the fire was protected, which is a good thing."" Sixty of the approximately 80 miles of fire perimeter are now contained, he said.
Work continued Tuesday to build a control line in the upper No Name and Grizzly Creek drainages northeast of Glenwood Springs.
T hree hotshot crews worked Monday to build a hand line along the southwest of rim of Grizzly Creek, and fire managers were hoping to connect that line to No Name Creek on Tuesday to secure the northwest edge of the fire.
An unmanned aerial system (aka drone) was used to inspect the two drainages Monday.
""They looked really good,"" Alaska IMT Operations Section Chief Karen Scholl said. ""They weren't showing much heat at all.""
There are now 589 personnel working on the fire, plus six dozers, six excavators and two choppers working to rehab lines in the areas of Coffee Pot Road, Bair Ranch, Red Canyon and No Name.
The fire began Aug. 10 in the median of Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon near the Grizzly Creek rest area. The Forest Service announced during a Facebook live community meeting Monday that the fire was human-caused. However, the specific cause remains under investigation.

Factors to reopening Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon remain on track ""in the coming days"" as firefighters continued Sunday to make progress on containing the Grizzly Creek Fire , which has been burning for two weeks east of Glenwood Springs.
The Colorado Department of Transportation officials over the weekend would not give an exact date to open, but the prediction late last week of the coming days, not weeks, holds true, they said. That timetable is with the caveat there are no drastic changes in the fire's movement or the weather.
And after it does open, CDOTofficials are concerned about future weather events and how those could affect closing the canyon in the near future. Even a quarter inch of rain could cause issues after the road opens, officials have said.
""If there's rain, we might have a safety closure,"" CDOT Region 3 communications manager Elise Thatcher said Sunday in a phone interview. ""So, keeping an eye on the forecast is the thing to do for travelers. ... We're very excited for a reopening, but also keep in mind that we're going to have safety closures in the short-term future due to weather.""
The 24-mile stretch of the interstate has been closed for two weeks since the Grizzly Creek Fire started in the median of the highway Aug. 10. Since then, it has burned more than 30,000 acres in and above the canyon.
The two-week shutdown is thought to be the longest in the canyon's history.
When the road reopens, a roughly 7-mile section will continue to be head-to-head on the eastbound deck, as the construction project in the westbound lanes remains in place. Most of the rockfall cleanup work also is taking place in the westbound lanes, CDOT northwest regional director Mike Goolsby said Saturday during a community meeting.
He said Xcel Energy continues to repair power lines in and above the canyon, and the upper tier of the interstate will be used to help move firefighters to either side of the fire .
""Not a lot of things are happening to the eastbound currently,"" he said. ""(The upper tier) also gives us to the opportunity to move fire crews quickly through the canyon not impacting traffic.""
Fire crews took advantage of the cooler weather and calmer winds over the weekend to build and strengthen fire lines.
As of Sunday night, containment on the Grizzly Creek Fire is at 31%, which is up from the 11% reported Friday morning going into the weekend, according to fire operations spokesman Brian Scott. Sunday evening's update from the incident command team has the overall burn area at 30,362 acres.
Fire crews have completed a containment line from Coffee Pot to Bair Ranch to I-70 on the eastern side of the fire. Crews worked Sunday on the north and southwest sides to build more bulldozer and containment lines, operations section chief Jeff Suber said in an update Sunday afternoon.
As well, a crew of five firefighters went up Sunday to Hanging Lake to put out hot spots near the trail and around the lake, Suber said.
Some pockets of heavy fuels continue to burn in the Spruce Ridge area farther south on the eastern flank, officials said Sunday in an update.
To the south, the fire was held up Saturday in aspen groves and sage brush is smoldering, and on the western flank, firefighters ""established direct line in steeper portions of Bear Creek and reinforced established containment lines.""
There are 15 hand crews, 11 bulldozers and other logging equipment part of the more than 800person team currently working on the Grizzly Creek Fire .
""We're enjoying some success,"" White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams said Saturday in a community meeting. ""But we're kind of moving into another phase of the fire.""
Fitzwilliams also said the ""craziness"" of the initial days is gone and giving way to the ""grind"" of the firefig ht.
Cottonwood Pass reopened Sunday to local passenger vehicle traffic only. Local traffic trips allowed include travel to/from work or school; medical, dental or veterinary appointments; and other essential businesses, as previously reported.
T ravelers should be prepared to show proof of their need to travel, and construction and delivery traffic must make a reservation for times between 8 and 10 a.m. and 4 and 6 p.m. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
The Eagle County Sheriff's Office announced Sunday night the lifting of pre-evacuation orders for the Sweetwater Road, Dotsero and Lower Colorado River Road areas.
""It's imperative for everyone to continue to be vigilant and adhere to the fire restrictions in the county,"" Sheriff James Van Beek said in a news release Sunday night. ""We know from our coordination with the Grizzly Creek Fire command that this fire remains active in many places and that we'll continue to see smoke in the area for quite some time. We can't let our guard down with how tinderbox dry the conditions are in our county.""

Growing spotlight on environmental justice focuses on Colora.txt,"Growing spotlight on environmental justice focuses on Colorado's
energy future

The prospect of testifying before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission might be unnerving for a lot of
people, but Ean Tafoya was excited about being cross examined during a recenthearing.
""Huge for me and the (environmental justice) coalition,"" Tafoya wrote in a text to The Denver Post before
the April 21 hearing on a utility's plan to help move the state's transition to electric vehicles forward.
Tafoya, the Colorado field advocate for GreenLatinos, referred to ""the power of the mic"" to convey the
positions of his organization and other members of the Environmental Justice Coalition on Black Hills
Energy's proposal.
The advocates will also weigh in on Xcel Energy-Colorado's new electric resource plan, focusing on the
impacts they believe the utility's decisions will have on communities that have borne much of the brunt of
pollution from power plants and other heavy industry.
Tafoya, 35, grew up in northeast Denver, an area once labeled the nation's most polluted zip code as a
result of decades of industrial activity that contaminated the air, water and soil. The area is home to an oil
refinery, a natural gas power plant and two Superfund sites. Residents contend with emissions from
vehicles speeding by on Interstate 70, which is undergoing major reconstruction in the area.
""The entire area is probably one of the worst air-pollution areas in the entire country,"" Tafoya said.
Activists and elected officials say it's time that low-income communities and people of color who have
been disproportionately affected by industrial pollution have a say about how or whether the activity
should continue in their backyards. At the federal and state levels, there is a push to make environmental
justice a priority in decisions on transportation, energy projects and whether land should be developed or
left open.
A handful of bills moving through the Colorado General Assembly address environmental justice. One,
Senate Bill 21-200, would set specific caps on greenhouse-gas emissions as well as establish an
environmental justice ombudsperson position and an advisory board in the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment.
""Climate change and pollution hurt all of us. It doesn't necessarily hurt all of us evenly,"" state Rep.
Dominique Jackson, an Aurora Democrat, said during a news conference last week.
Jackson is sponsoring HB 21-1266, which would create a task force to make recommendations to the
legislature on strategies, policies and programs for confronting environmental inequities statewide. The
bill requires the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission to reach out to communities that have suffered
more harmful environmental effects than others.
The opportunity to speak in a PUC hearing, a first for Tafoya, was an important step in providing a voice
for people who face higher pollution levels, greater health risks and have less input into environmental
laws and policies, he said.
""The PUC has not been the most friendly place for environmental justice advocates. It's not been a place
in which we've engaged effectively in the past,"" Tafoya said. ""It's been clear that our voice has been
missing.
""But it seems to me they're turning that corner,"" he added.
As Xcel Energy seeks approval from the PUC for its new electric resource plan, Tafoya and other
advocates hope to participate in the process. Xcel, Colorado's largest electric utility, has been
commended for its strides in adding more renewable energy to its portfolio. The utility's resource and
clean energy plan filed in March with the PUC proposes cutting greenhouse-gas emissions 85% by 2030
and getting about 80% of its power from renewable sources by 2030. All its coal operations will be retired
by 2040, according to the plan.
Environmental and community activists want Xcel Energy to shut down coal faster. And they would like
to see the Cherokee natural gas plant in northeast Denver phased out and replaced with renewable
energy and the Comanche 3 coal-fired plant in Pueblo closed before the planned retirement of 2040.
While burning natural gas produces roughly half the carbon dioxide of coal, the methane that producing
and using natural gas emits is a potent greenhouse gas. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is
about 84 times more powerful in the short term than carbon dioxide at trapping heat.
""Gas isn't the solution that it's touted as. We want to see a transition to renewables to prevent further
exacerbating the climate crisis,"" said Ren-Caspar Smith, an organizer with the Sierra Club.
For years Xcel Energy-Colorado has been listening to and working with the communities it serves about
interest in moving to more renewable energy, said Alice Jackson, the utility's president. The new
resource plan reflects that progress, she said.
""It's just a huge step forward and it's well beyond what anybody thought we were go to be able to do in
this time frame,"" Jackson said.
In 2018, Xcel announced a goal of being carbon-free by 2050, making it the first major utility to set such a
goal.
At the same time, Jackson said, the company sees having a diverse set of power resources as key to
delivering affordable and reliable electricity ""all day, every day."" Continuing to operate the Cherokee gas
plant and the Comanche 3 coal unit until 2040 are part of the plan to do that, she said.
""Fuel diversity is important right now. Technology hasn't developed to the point yet where we can sit
there and say we don't need these other types of resources in order to be able to provide reliable service
for our customers,"" Jackson said.
The freezing weather in February that caused power outages from Texas to the Midwest and sent
natural gas prices soaring across the region, including in Colorado, but Xcel Energy kept the power
flowing, Jackson said.
""There is a need for firm capacity and reliability, resources that can turn on and off easily whenever
needed for as long as they're needed, but gas isn't the only way to provide that,"" said Smith.
Renewable energy sources, battery storage, managed demand and connecting to a regional
transmission network are other options, Smith said. Beyond the price of gas are concerns about the
health effects, such as respiratory problems, from living around power plants or where the gas is drilled,
he added.
""When we talk about plants like Cherokee in north Denver, we can't forget about the environmental
justice concerns. It's an extremely densely populated area,"" Smith said. ""About 67,000 people live within
three miles of that plant and are breathing that air every day.""
Tafoya said there are multiple sources of pollution in the area that includes where he grew up, the Cole
neighborhood, and the Elyria-Swansea neighborhood. The Suncor Energy oil refinery, to the north, has a
history of malfunctions and, along with the Cherokee and Comanche power plants, is among the state's
top 20 greenhouse gas polluters, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency records.
""You can see the Cherokee gas plant towers from my mom's front yard,"" Tafoya said in a video
produced by the Sierra Club.
In an interview, Tafoya said he knows of many people in the neighborhood who have asthma, including
his godson.
""When we saw COVID start to happen, we saw the connection between respiratory diseases and preexisting conditions,"" Tafoya said. ""COVID hit our community hard.""
A 2014 report by Denver environmental health officials said the predominantly Latino neighborhoods of
Elyria and Swansea neighborhoods suffer some of the highest rates of asthma, cardiovascular disease
and other illnesses in the city for a number of reasons. The EPA's EJSCREEN, an environmental justice
mapping tool, shows the Cole neighborhood in the 89th percentile for small particulate pollution, which
means only 11% of the state has higher levels.
Sources of particulate matter pollution, which has been linked to lung and heart disease, include power
plants and vehicles, according to the EPA.
""Xcel takes environmental justice seriously,"" Jackson said. ""We're looking at it pretty holistically: the
cost, the economic impact on the communities, the emissions, air quality, as well as jobs.""
The Cherokee plant was converted from coal to natural gas as part of the Colorado $1 billion Clean AirClean Jobs Act program approved in 2010 to cut air pollution.
""The reduced emissions that we've realized at that plant are dramatic,"" Jackson said. ""Nitrous oxide is
down by more than 95%. SO2 (sulfur dioxide) is down over 99.9%, and mercury has been completely
eliminated.""
Comanche 3 in Pueblo will be the last of Xcel Energy's coal plants to close. Xcel has proposed running it
at no more than a third of its capacity after 2030 and shuttering it by 2040. Jackson said the plant will
provide reliable, affordable energy as Xcel makes the transition to ""a new energy future.""
Jackson acknowledged the mechanical problems that idled Comanche 3 for most of 2020, but said it has
been a good plant on the system.
But a scathing report by the PUC released March 1 paints a different picture, one of a chronically
malfunctioning unit whose operating and electricity costs have been higher than projected before its 2010
opening. The upfront capital cost projection for Comanche 3 was $680 million, but wound up being $784
million. The plant averaged 91.5 days per year of unplanned outages over the last decade.
""The Comanche 3 plant, not only is it a lemon in what it's costing the consumer, it's also polluting other
Latinos in Pueblo. I don't want to see that happen to anybody,"" Tafoya said.

Growing spotlight on environmental justice focuses on Colorado's
energy future
April 23, 2021  Colorado Hometown Newspapers (Boulder County, CO)
Author: Judith Kohler Section: Business 1520 Words

The prospect of testifying before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission might be unnerving for a lot of
people, but Ean Tafoya was excited about being cross examined during a recenthearing.
""Huge for me and the (environmental justice) coalition,"" Tafoya wrote in a text to The Denver Post before
the April 21 hearing on a utility's plan to help move the state's transition to electric vehicles forward.
Tafoya, the Colorado field advocate for GreenLatinos, referred to ""the power of the mic"" to convey the
positions of his organization and other members of the Environmental Justice Coalition on Black Hills
Energy's proposal.
The advocates will also weigh in on Xcel Energy-Colorado's new electric resource plan, focusing on the
impacts they believe the utility's decisions will have on communities that have borne much of the brunt of
pollution from power plants and other heavy industry.
Tafoya, 35, grew up in northeast Denver, an area once labeled the nation's most polluted zip code as a
result of decades of industrial activity that contaminated the air, water and soil. The area is home to an oil
refinery, a natural gas power plant and two Superfund sites. Residents contend with emissions from
vehicles speeding by on Interstate 70, which is undergoing major reconstruction in the area.
""The entire area is probably one of the worst air-pollution areas in the entire country,"" Tafoya said.
Activists and elected officials say it's time that low-income communities and people of color who have
been disproportionately affected by industrial pollution have a say about how or whether the activity
should continue in their backyards. At the federal and state levels, there is a push to make environmental
justice a priority in decisions on transportation, energy projects and whether land should be developed or
left open.
A handful of bills moving through the Colorado General Assembly address environmental justice. One,
Senate Bill 21-200, would set specific caps on greenhouse-gas emissions as well as establish an
environmental justice ombudsperson position and an advisory board in the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment.
""Climate change and pollution hurt all of us. It doesn't necessarily hurt all of us evenly,"" state Rep.
Dominique Jackson, an Aurora Democrat, said during a news conference last week.
Jackson is sponsoring HB 21-1266, which would create a task force to make recommendations to the
legislature on strategies, policies and programs for confronting environmental inequities statewide. The
bill requires the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission to reach out to communities that have suffered
more harmful environmental effects than others.
The opportunity to speak in a PUC hearing, a first for Tafoya, was an important step in providing a voice
for people who face higher pollution levels, greater health risks and have less input into environmental
laws and policies, he said.
""The PUC has not been the most friendly place for environmental justice advocates. It's not been a place
in which we've engaged effectively in the past,"" Tafoya said. ""It's been clear that our voice has been
missing.
""But it seems to me they're turning that corner,"" he added.
As Xcel Energy seeks approval from the PUC for its new electric resource plan, Tafoya and other
advocates hope to participate in the process. Xcel, Colorado's largest electric utility, has been
commended for its strides in adding more renewable energy to its portfolio. The utility's resource and
clean energy plan filed in March with the PUC proposes cutting greenhouse-gas emissions 85% by 2030
and getting about 80% of its power from renewable sources by 2030. All its coal operations will be retired
by 2040, according to the plan.
Environmental and community activists want Xcel Energy to shut down coal faster. And they would like
to see the Cherokee natural gas plant in northeast Denver phased out and replaced with renewable
energy and the Comanche 3 coal-fired plant in Pueblo closed before the planned retirement of 2040.
While burning natural gas produces roughly half the carbon dioxide of coal, the methane that producing
and using natural gas emits is a potent greenhouse gas. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is
about 84 times more powerful in the short term than carbon dioxide at trapping heat.
""Gas isn't the solution that it's touted as. We want to see a transition to renewables to prevent further
exacerbating the climate crisis,"" said Ren-Caspar Smith, an organizer with the Sierra Club.
For years Xcel Energy-Colorado has been listening to and working with the communities it serves about
interest in moving to more renewable energy, said Alice Jackson, the utility's president. The new
resource plan reflects that progress, she said.
""It's just a huge step forward and it's well beyond what anybody thought we were go to be able to do in
this time frame,"" Jackson said.
In 2018, Xcel announced a goal of being carbon-free by 2050, making it the first major utility to set such a
goal.
At the same time, Jackson said, the company sees having a diverse set of power resources as key to
delivering affordable and reliable electricity ""all day, every day."" Continuing to operate the Cherokee gas
plant and the Comanche 3 coal unit until 2040 are part of the plan to do that, she said.
""Fuel diversity is important right now. Technology hasn't developed to the point yet where we can sit
there and say we don't need these other types of resources in order to be able to provide reliable service
for our customers,"" Jackson said.
The freezing weather in February that caused power outages from Texas to the Midwest and sent
natural gas prices soaring across the region, including in Colorado, but Xcel Energy kept the power
flowing, Jackson said.
""There is a need for firm capacity and reliability, resources that can turn on and off easily whenever
needed for as long as they're needed, but gas isn't the only way to provide that,"" said Smith.

Hanging_Lake_appears_to_have_been_spared_as_fire__Aspen_Times_The_CO___August_15_2020.txt,"Hanging Lake ap p e ars to have be e n sp are d as fire - Asp e n T ime s, The (CO ) - August 15, 2020
Aug ust 15, 2020  Aspen Times, The (CO)  John Stroud Glenwood Spring s Post Independent
The pristine Hanging Lake feature in Glenwood Canyon -- a popular attraction where new protections went into effect last year aimed at controlling visitor numbers -- appears to have come away unscathed from the Grizzly Creek Fire .
""The fire took a severe run last night, and when we all looked at the map and saw the fire perimeter, we realized that it had burned over the Hanging Lake area,"" White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams said during a Friday evening Facebook live community update.
After doing a flyover of the area Friday afternoon, from the air anyway, it appears that the fire did not burn in the lake basin itself, Fitzwilliams said.
""The immediate area around the lake, the vegetation at the lake and on the cliffs, and the boardwalk, were not impacted directly by the fire,"" Fitzwilliams said.
However, the fire did burn ""intensely"" all around Hanging Lake, mostly above and to the sides of the lake feature.
So, ""we're not out of the woods"" in terms of potential impacts from fire runoff into the lake when it rains or during the winter snow runoff, he said.
""We really won't know for a while what long-term impacts will be, because Hanging Lake is more about the whole hydrology of that area,"" Fitzwilliams said. ""Right now, though, we feel pretty good about it.""
Fire managers confirmed Friday morning that the fire burned in the area of Hanging Lake when it grew from about 6,200 acres earlier in the day Thursday to more than 13,000 acres later that night. Most of that fire activity was on the northern and northeastern flank of the fire, where Hanging Lake is located.
The popular visitor attraction now operates on a reservation-based hiking permit system to limit the number of visitors per day to 615. That number was reduced even further this summer due to the coronavirus restrictions on large gatherings to just 200 people per day, and the shuttle system from Glenwood Springs to and from the trailhead was suspended.
Grizzly Creek Fire incident PIO Brian Scott said Friday morning that sometimes fast-moving fires can burn right over certain areas without causing much damage. Hanging Lake, with its high cliff walls on three sides and a moist lake and stream ecosystem, appears to have been spared.
Scott also acknowledged that a lingering concern would be fire runoff eventually getting into the fragile lake ecosystem.
Hanging Lake is ""a large and rare example of a travertine deposition lake and hanging garden plant
community,"" the Forest Service noted in its 2018 decision to implement a fee-based system to control the number of daily visitors on the rugged 2-mile trail up to the lake.
""Once the fire danger has passed, we can get in there and assess the opportunities to put in some erosion control abatement,"" Scott said. ""With that being such a valuable resource, if we can prevent damage like that we will take those measures.""

October 15, 2020  Associated Press State Wire: Colorado (CO)  By MATTHEW BROWN and CAMILLE FASSETT, The Associated Press
SANT A CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Wildfires churning out dense plumes of smoke as they scorch huge swaths of the U.S. West Coast have exposed millions of people to hazardous pollution levels, causing emergency room visits to spike and potentially thousands of deaths among the elderly and infirm, according to an Associated Press analysis of pollution data and interviews with physicians, health authorities and researchers.
Smoke at concentrations that topped the government's charts for health risks and lasted at least a day enshrouded counties inhabited by more than 8 million people across five states in recent weeks, AP's analysis shows.
Major cities in Oregon, which has been especially hard hit, last month suffered the highest pollution levels they've ever recorded when powerful winds supercharged fires that had been burning in remote areas and sent them hurtling to the edge of densely populated Portland.
Medical complications began arising while communities were still enveloped in smoke, including hundreds of additional emergency room visits daily in Oregon, according to state health officials.
""It's been brutal for me,"" said Barb T rout, a 64-year-old retiree living south of Portland in the Willamette Valley. She was twice taken to the emergency room by ambulance following severe asthmatic reactions, something that had never happened to her before.
T rout had sheltered inside as soon as smoke rolled into the valley just after Labor Day but within days had an asthma attack that lefther gasping for air and landed her in the ER. Two weeks later, when smoke from fires in California drifted into the valley, she had an even more violent reaction that T rout described as a near-death experience.
""It hit me quick and hard __ more so than the first one. I wasn't hardly even breathing,"" she recalled. After getting stabilized with drugs, T rout was sent home but the specter of a third attack now haunts her. She and her husband installed an alarm system so she can press a panic button when in distress to call for help.
""It's put a whole new level on my life,'' she said. ""I'm trying not to live in fear, but I've got to be really really cautious.""
In nearby Salem, T rout's pulmonologist Martin Johnson said people with existing respiratory issues started showing up at his hospital or calling his office almost immediately after the smoke arrived, many struggling to breathe. Salem is in Marion county, which experienced eight days of pollution at hazardous levels during a short period, some of the worst conditions seen the West over the past two decades, according to AP's analysis.
Most of Johnson's patients are expected to recover buthe said some could have permanent loss
of lung function. Then there are the ""hidden"" victims who Johnson suspects died from heart attacks or other problems triggered by the poor air quality but whose cause of death will be chalked up to something else.
""Many won't show up at the hospital or they'll die at home or they'll show up at hospice for other reasons, such as pneumonia or other complications,"" Johnson said.
Based on prior studies of pollution-related deaths and the number of people exposed to recent fires , researchers at Stanford University estimated that as many as 3,000 people over 65 in California alone died prematurely after being exposed to smoke during a six-week period beginning Aug. 1. Hundreds more deaths could have occurred in Washington over several weeks of poor air caused by the fires , according to University of Washington researchers.
The findings for both states have not been published in peer-reviewed journals. No such estimate was available for Oregon.
Wildfires are a regular occurrence in Western states but they've grown more intense and dangerous as a changing climate dries out forests thick with trees and underbrush from decades of fire suppression. What makes the smoke from these fires dangerous are particles too small for the naked eye to see that can be breathed in and cause respiratory problems.
On any given day, western fires can produce 10 times more particles than are produced by all other pollution sources including vehicle emissions and industrial facilities, said Shawn Urbanski, a U.S. Forest Service smoke scientist.
Fires across the West emitted more than a million tons of the particles in 2012, 2015 and 2017, and almost as much in 2018 -- the year a blaze in Paradise, California killed 85 people and burned 14,000 houses, generating a thick plume that blanketed portions of Northern California for weeks. Figures for 2017 and 2018 are preliminary.
A confluence of meteorological events made the smoke especially bad this year: first, fierce winds up and down the coast whipped fires into a fury, followed in Oregon by a weather inversion that trapped smoke close to the ground and made it inescapable for days. Hundreds of miles to the south in San Francisco, smoke turned day into night, casting an eerie orange pall over a city where even before the pandemic facemasks had become common at times to protect against smoke.
AP's analysis of smoke exposure was based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data compiled from hundreds of air quality monitoring stations. Census data was used to determine the numbers of people living in affected areas of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and Montana.
At least 38 million people live in counties subjected to pollution considered unhealthy for the general population for five days, according to AP's analysis. That included more than 25 million people in California, 7.2 million in Washington, 3.5 million in Oregon, 1 million in Idaho and 299,000 people in Montana.
The state totals for the number of people exposed to unhealthy air on a given day were derived from counties where at least one monitoring site registered unhealthy air.
Scientists studying long-term health problems have found correlations between smoke exposure and decreased lung function, weakened immune systems and higher rates of flu. That includes studies from northwestern Montana communities blanketed with smoke for weeks in 2017.
""Particulate matter enters your lungs, it gets way down deep, it irrigates the lining and it possibly enters your bloodstream,"" said University of Montana professor Erin Landguth. ""We're seeing the effects.""
Climate experts say residents of the West Coast and Northern Rockies should brace for more frequent major smoke events, as warming temperatures and drought fuel bigger, more intense fires .
Their message is that climate change isn't going to bring worse conditions: they are already here. The scale of this year's fires is pushing the envelope"" of wildfireseverity modeled out to 2050, said Harvard university climate researcher Loretta Mickley
""The bad years will increase. The smoke will increase,"" said Jeffrey Pierce an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. ""It's not unreasonable that we could be getting a 2020-type year every other year.""

Heat_wind_leads_to_next_stage_fire_restrictions__Aspen_Times_The_CO___August_12_2020.txt,"He at, wind le ads to ne xt stage fire re strictio ns - Asp e n T ime s, The (CO ) - August 12, 2020
Stage 2 fire restrictions will go into effect in Pitkin County and beyond first thing Friday morning, authorities said Tuesday.
The restrictions -- which start at 12:01 a.m. Friday also will include Eagle County, the White River National Forest , Bureau of Land Management acreage and the Basalt State Wildlife Area shooting range -- forbid all campfires, charcoal grills and fireworks, according to press releases and local authorities.
""The decision to implement Stage 2 restrictions is based on data and science and not on a whim,"" said Alex Burchetta, director of operations at the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office.
Hot, dry, windy weather and no rain predicted in the near future has led to low moisture levels in fuels and the potential for high combustibility if a fire breaks out, said Burchetta and Valerie MacDonald, the county's emergency manager.
Winds are of particular concern, with red-flag warnings and a fire weather warning issued Tuesday and Wednesday by the National Weather Service for the Pitkin County and surrounding area.
""My deputies will enforce this fire restriction and will issue citations to those who violate it,"" Pitkin County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo said in a statement. ""We are in an extreme fire season, and having seen other large fires in our region recently, we know we must do everything we can to deter and prevent fires in our community.""
Residents and visitors who violate the restrictions can be fined $500 for the first offense, $750 for the second and $1,000 for the third, the release states.
Stage 2 restrictions also forbid cigarette smoking outdoors in forest areas and in areas of the county outside the Aspen city limits, Burchetta said. Smoking must take place within enclosed buildings or inside vehicles or trailers, he said. Smoking material also must be extinguished and disposed of inside those enclosed areas.
Aspen Fire officials, in consultation with Aspen Police officials, will meet in the coming days to decide how to handle outdoor cigarette smoking within Aspen city limits, said Parker Lathrop, deputy fire chief at the Aspen Fire Department.
MacDonald encouraged residents to have an evacuation plan in case of a fast-moving wildfire in Aspen or unincorporated Pitkin County. For more information on how to create such a plan, go to ready.g ov/plan.
Camp stoves, lanterns or grills that use propane or other gases and have a shutoff switch are allowed under the restrictions.
Officials with Colorado Parks and Wildlife decided to close the Basalt State Wildlife Area shooting range as of Tuesday ""out of an abundance of caution,"" according to a CPW press release. Stage 2 restrictions do not ban shooting range operations as closing them can push people to shoot on public lands and create other fire hazards, the release states.
However, in consultation with local authorities, CPW decided to close the range immediately, according to the release. The range is where the 2018 Lake Christine Fire started and burned more than 12,800 acres on Basalt mountain.

Here is whats in the now54 billion transportation bill debat.txt,"Here is what's in the now-$5.4 billion transportation bill debated by
Colorado lawmakers
May 26, 2021  Colorado Hometown Newspapers (Boulder County, CO)
Author: Jon Murray Section: News 1235 Words
OpenURL Link
A nearly $5.4 billion transportation bill under consideration in the Colorado legislature would tackle
several big-ticket items at the same time  fixing and expanding highways, boosting transit and other
alternatives to driving, and rapidly expanding the use of electric vehicles.
There's a lot to debate in Senate Bill 260, Democratic lawmakers' bid to stake out sustainable funding
streams for transportation into the future and address climate change. They propose a half-dozen small
new road-user fees that would raise billions of dollars  and would affect most people in the state  all
while navigating around state fiscal roadblocks that would have required going to voters to pass more
straightforward tax increases.
The package includes serious money for projects at both the state and local levels. And the electric
vehicle programs that lawmakers envision would be among the nation's most ambitious, aiming both to
increase the number of clean-energy vehicles on the roads and to expand the charging infrastructure to
support them.
The bill passed the Senate May 17, with little Republican support, and now is under consideration in the
House. Here is a look at its major components, updated to reflect amendments as of May 28.
How much the bill would raise
The bottom-line projection over the next 11 state fiscal years  through 2031-32  is nearly $5.4 billion,
up slightly from nearly $5.3 billion when the bill was introduced. Of that, about $3.8 billion would come
from the new fees over 10 years, starting when they take effect mid-next year.
RELATED: Colorado transportation bill puts focus on righting past wrongs  but does it do enough?
The rest, $1.6 billion, comes from state budget transfers  many of those already planned from prior
transportation commitments  and new state and federal stimulus dollars approved in recent months. A
small portion of the budget transfers would recur each year.
Lowdown on the fees
While some of the proposed fees would increase on set schedules initially, all eventually would be
pegged to inflation or another index that accounts for rising construction costs. Collection would begin in
July 2022 and continue beyond 2032, with no sunsets.
Fees are listed by how much they'd bring in over the first decade:
* Gasoline purchases ($1.6 billion): A ""road usage"" fee would begin at 2 cents per gallon, ratcheting up a
cent per year to 8 cents in mid-2028, with inflation adjustment beginning three years later. It would be on
top of the state's existing 22-cents-per-gallon gas tax. Analysts estimated the new fee would cost the
average driver $28 in the first year and more as it rises.
* Retail deliveries ($1.2 billion): A 27-cent delivery fee would apply to orders  including those made
online  for goods and most other items subject to sales tax, including restaurant food.
* Diesel fuel purchases ($401 million): This fee would follow the same schedule as the gas fee, starting
at 2 cents and rising to 8 cents by mid-2028.
* Electric vehicle registration fees ($322 million): The state's existing $50 registration fee for plug-in
electric vehicles would be pegged to inflation. New annual EV fees would be phased in on a 10-year
schedule to offset owners' tax savings by not buying gas. For plug-in hybrids, the fee would start at $3
and rise to $27, and for full-electric vehicles, it would start at $4 and rise to $96.
* Ride-hailing fees ($203 million): A 30-cent fee would apply to prearranged rides provided by services
such as Uber and Lyft, with a discounted 15-cent fee if the ride is in a zero-emissions vehicle. The fee
doesn't apply to taxis, but the bill orders the state to conduct a ""parity study"" for that industry.
* Car rentals ($92 million): An existing $2 per day fee for car rentals up to 30 days would be indexed to
inflation, and the fee would newly apply to car-share rentals lasting 24 hours or longer.
The bill includes short-term reductions of vehicle registration fees for all drivers of $11.10 in 2022 and
$5.55 in 2023, with those fees reverting to normal in 2024.
How the money would be spent
Here is the breakdown of spending through mid-2032, according to a Denver Post analysis of legislative
documents and summaries. Percentages are rounded, and some figures are approximate.
* $2 billion (38%): New state projects, mostly work on highways, bridges and tunnels.
* $947 million (18%): Local governments' distributions from a highway fund for use on local projects and
maintenance.
* $855 million (16%): Paying off debt taken under previously approved transportation bills and offsetting
registration fee reductions in 2023 and 2024.
* $734 million (14%): Electric vehicle programs aimed at rapidly increasing adoption of clean-energy
vehicles  including the conversions of fleets  and providing more charging stations.
* $453 million (9%): Multimodal Transportation and Mitigation Options Fund, with the money available to
pay for projects that support alternatives to driving, including transit, bikeways and pedestrian
improvements, as well as air-pollution mitigation. Eighty-five percent would go to local governments.
* $234 million (4%): A state air pollution mitigation fund under the Colorado Department of Transportation
that would pay for projects in the Denver metro area and the northern Front Range, which violate federal
ozone limits, to reduce vehicle traffic and air pollution. Potential projects include vegetation planting,
programs to shift people from driving to mass transit, and retrofits for construction equipment. A special
focus would be on communities near highways and those that have high shares of households with low
incomes or racial or ethnic minorities.
* $115 million (2%): CDOT's Revitalizing Main Streets program, which gives grants to local governments
to fix up state highways through their downtowns to improve infrastructure and increase safety for
pedestrians and other users.
Much of the state funding in some categories would go toward CDOT's 10-year, $5 billion priority project
plan, though it would not be fully funded.
How the bill side-steps TABOR
Raising taxes in Colorado requires asking voters under the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights. By proposing user
fees and using existing and new state enterprises to charge them, lawmakers are sidestepping TABOR.
It's a step that draws ire from Republicans in particular.
SB-260 also avoids a new requirement for voter approval of larger fees under Proposition 117, which
voters passed in November, when a new state enterprise would raise more than $100 million in the first
five years. The four new enterprises the bill would create include three geared toward dealing with
different aspects of electric vehicles that, if combined, potentially would exceed 117's threshold.
But the bill's sponsors and some legal analysts argue each of those three has a different purpose 
increasing the community's adoption of clean vehicles, converting fleets to electric and supporting clean
transit. It's possible the bill could face a legal challenge if it's passed into law.
Other components of the bill
If passed, the bill also would:
* Extend exemptions in the vehicle emissions testing program from seven years to 10 years for new
cars and 12 years for plug-in hybrid vehicles, if federal authorities approve the request.
* Cancel parts of bipartisan transportation-funding compromises passed in 2017 and 2018. Those
include a reduction in the state's TABOR limit, which would allow $225 million more in spending in the
coming fiscal year, and a delayed plan to send a $1.3 billion transportation bonding measure to state
voters in November.
* Require CDOT and regional planning organizations, including in Denver, to assess the potential for
highway expansion projects to increase air pollution and traffic volume.
* Allow those regional organizations to act as regional transportation authorities  potentially seeking
voter approval for their own transportation-funding measures.

Her dad was a Park Service chief ranger. My dad was a forest ranger and senior fire management officer. I fought fire and so did my brother-in-law. My son-in-law is a squad boss on a hotshot crew.
All of us came home safe every time over dozens of fire seasons since 1947 when Dad fought his first fire. That's a 73-year legacy of our family fighting wildfire. It's also a remarkable safety record, a record that mirrors the fire community 's overall record since 1905.
The United States Forest Service has suffered 16 line of duty deaths in the past 10 years of people who died fighting wildfires. It's a remarkable number for lots of reasons. The agency fields over 15,000 firefighters for up to eight months every year doing some of the most hazardous work imaginable. There are very few pursuits as dangerous as cutting down a burning tree or digging fire line just feet away from 3-foot flames.
It's astonishing that so few people die fighting wildfires. It's also a testament to the Forest Service and related agencies that they do this work year after year so safely. Most of us can't imagine what it takes to get up day after day at oh-dark-thirty and work in the heat and stress of the fire line for 16 hours, eat, sleep, and start again. But the Forest Service has been doing it for 115 years. It's dangerous, difficult, very hard work, but we come home alive, mostly.
The Portland Oregonian estimated that over 10 million Westerners have staffed the fire lines in the last 100 years. It's more than that now. Most of those firefighters lived to tell the tale ... well, lots of tales, most of them true. When you're living a life that's stranger than fiction, you don't need to gussy it up much. The stories tend to tell themselves.
The truth is, there is a very thin yellow line that stands between all of us and the annual wildfires that burn our homes blacken our forests and rangelands. A handful of people, armed with hand tools, power saws, and fire hoses, make the daily decision to stand and fight while the rest of us are running for cover.
If you've never fought fire, you can't begin to know how counterintuitive it is to even imagine you could stop the 100-foot walls of flames that march across our T V screens every summer. It's the bravest thing.
Firefighters are notheroes and they don't think of themselves that way. They are highly trained, well-led, well-fed performance artists who control their natural impulses of fight or flight and work according to well-practiced and strongly held principles and work procedures that yield a high rate of success. Every fire goes out eventually. The trick is knowing when to stand and fight and when to do a tactical retreat to find better defensive ground.
It doesn't matter whether the firefighter is driving a fire engine or a very large air tanker; it takes
true grit to deliver the right effort to the right place to affect the course of a fire. Young firefighters take their cues from the old hands. Fighting fire is like war fighting, or so say the veterans in the ranks. People work for the safety and well-being of their mates to the left and right in line. It's like the Spartan hoplite shield wall. You cover the person on your left with your shield and everybody lives.
The fire agencies are to be commended and thanked in this awful fire year of 2020. They put the fires out, protect our homes and lives, and keep coming back for more. T hank a firefighter. They'll appreciate it and they deserve it.

U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado sent a letter Tuesday to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack, urging him to support wildfire recovery in the West and specifically in Colorado.
In the letter, the Democrats included information about the devastation brought on by wildfires last year and asked Vilsack to make wildfire recovery a priority.
""Last summer, wildfires consumed over 10 million acres across the country, with almost 50% burning on National Forest Service land,"" the letter said.
The letter also focused on devastation and recovery needs in Colorado, where three of its largest fires in history scorched thousands of acres last year.
""Last year, the Cameron Peak Fire burned over 200,000 acres in four months, and in one day alone, the East Troublesome Fire grew more than 100,000 acres,"" the letter said. ""In Colorado, the U.S. Forest Service has already identified approximately $50 million in immediate needs.""
Bennet and Hickenlooper also acknowledged both the importance and the faults of the Natural Resource Conservation Service's Emergency Watershed Protection program and the Forest Service's Burned Area Emergency Response program. They urged Vilsack to take action to ensure that the programs become more effective.
""The effectiveness of these programs is sometimes limited due to administrative hurdles, local match requirements, staffing shortages and inconsistent funding,"" the letter said. ""Therefore, we encourage you to use USDA's broad discretion to maximize flexibilities as needed, and we stand ready to work with you in Congress to ensure that wildfire recovery programs have the funding and flexibility they need.""
The senators' letter comes almost two weeks after Vilsack's confirmation to the position of USDA secretary.
As a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Bennet participated in Vilsack's confirmation hearings. During his confirmation hearing, Vilsack agreed with Bennet that forests are important and undervalued as ""critical infrastructure"" in the U.S.
""Yet we still aren't managing our forests like the critical infrastructure they are,"" Bennet said in the confirmation hearing. ""And with climate change driving hotter and drier conditions, we're experiencing more catastrophic wildfires across the West, including the three largest in Colorado's history last year.""
Bennet expressed support for Vilsack's nomination early on in the confirmation process, telling him they would ""roll out the red carpet"" for Vilsack if he ever visited Colorado.
The letter was similarly friendly. The senators expressed their appreciation for Vilsack and their interest in working with him.
""We appreciate your demonstrated commitment to our forests and watersheds and look forward to working with you in the months ahead to ensure that Colorado communities have a partner in the USDA as they recover from these devastating wildfires,"" the letter said.

High Country Conservation Center highlights climate action p.txt,"High Country Conservation Center highlights climate action plan,
recycling program in 2019 report
February 8, 2020  Summit Daily News (CO)
Author: Deepan Dutta ddutta@summitdaily.com Section: Environment 559 Words
OpenURL Link
FRISCO  The High Country Conservation Center, Summit County's main recycling and conservation
nonprofit, gave its annual report for 2019 to the Board of County Commissioners during their regular work
session Tuesday.
High Country Conservation Center Executive Director Jen Schenk and Climate Action Director Jess
Hoover were on hand to deliver the report. Among the highlights in their presentation to the board was the
countywide adoption of a climate action plan and implementation of programs paid for by 2018's Ballot
measure 1A, also known as the county's ""Strong Future"" fund.
The conservation center lobbied to get every one of Summit's major towns  Breckenridge, Dillon,
Frisco and Silverthorne  along with the county government, to sign on to the ""Summit Community
Climate Action Plan."" The plan calls for achieving 100% renewable electricity across the county by 2035,
expediting the transition to electrical vehicles and construction of the required infrastructure, improving
public transit and multi-modal infrastructure for biking and walking, and cutting greenhouse gas
emissions from commercial and residential buildings with the implementation of newer and efficient
building and land-use codes.
The combined efforts of the county aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the county by 50% by
2030 and 80% by 2050.
Aside from the climate action plan, the conservation center also started putting ""Strong Future"" voterapproved funds into action last year. The initiative devoted $1.7 million in county taxpayer funds towards
creating and expanding recycling programs.
Among the new offerings funded by Strong Future money is the county's new food scrap composting
program, where residents can grab a food scrap storage container from conservation center and use it to
store discarded food debris. When the container is full, they can be emptied into a bear-proof composting
bin at the Breckenridge or Frisco recycling centers. Those bins go to the Summit County Resource
Allocation Park, where the scraps are deposited at the landfill's composting pad to be organically broken
down and converted into useful plant soil.
In 2019, 53 tons of food scraps had been diverted from the landfill, which is the equivalent of taking 121
cars off the road annually.
Strong Future funds have also been used to revamp the county's recycling programs to recycle glass,
allowing for one of the most lucrative and heavy recyclables to finally be diverted away from the landfill.
The county has also started recycling mattresses, a boon for the lodging industry, as well as cartons.
The conservation center has also hosted a number of educational events and presentations, including
""Simple, Serious, Solvable,"" by Scott Denning, ""Climate Change and the Colorado River,"" by Brad Udall,
an electric vehicle ride and drive demonstration, and a screening of the film, ""The Human Element.""
The conservation center also made steady headway into its residential and commercial Energy Smart
Colorado and Resource Wise programs to boost energy efficiency. In total, HC3 conducted 75 home
energy assessments and 34 home energy retrofits. On the commercial side, the Resource Wise
program enrolled five new businesses and helped pay for three commercial sustainability projects with
rebates.
Schenk and Hoover said that in 2019, conservation center's residential and commercial programs
combined to keep an estimated 712 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions out of the atmosphere,
installed 3,648 LED lightbulbs, saved homeowners and businesses $13,065 with 'quick-fix' retrofits,
saved businesses $74,405 in business efficiency projects, and generated $308,134 worth of income for
local contractors.

EAGLE -- For many climate experts, the current drought in Western Colorado is the worst they've seen in their lifetimes, and the outlook isn't great for the coming summer.
Joel Lisonbee -- who works for the National Integrated Drought Information System, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- said drought conditions have been improving in Colorado but primarily on the eastern side of the Continental Divide. He noted that current 90-day outlooks aren't good for temperature, precipitation and drought tendency.
That's going to affect foresthealth, stream health and water supplies.
Eagle River Watershed Council Director Holly Loff said the lower runoff expected this spring may not give local streams enough water to self-cleanse as they do during more normal years.
Runoff translates to water that can clean out streambeds, including the small spaces between rocks. That's where insects reproduce. Fewer insects means less food for fish.
Combine that with expected warmer summer temperatures, and local fish populations will strug g le.
Even if local snowpack was normal, soils throughout the region are parched from a dry summer and fall in 2020. Snowmelt will soak into the soil before much of that water reaches local streams.
Fire season could be rugged
Drier-than-normal conditions can also contribute to active fire seasons. Fire officials across the region are gearing up.
Eagle Holy Cross Ranger District District Ranger Leanne Veldhuis said her office has hired a fire prevention officer for this year and has added two positions to its Front Country Ranger program.
Education is going to be a big part of those employees' jobs.
Veldhuis said the fire prevention officer will focus on community outreach and patrols.
Front Country Rangers, funded in part by local governments, will also work to help forest users understand the rules about fire safety. U.S. Forest Service employees in 2020 put out a number of unattended campfires, some of which were wind-whipped into small wildfires.
""We can't be everywhere at all times,"" Veldhuis said, adding that she hopes forest users come to understand the role they play preventing wildfires.
While fire is part of a forest ecosystem, Veldhuis noted that the equation changes when wildfires
start due to out-of-control campfires or other causes.
Those fires ""continue to change the landscape,"" Veldhuis said.
In preparation for this fire season, Veldhuis said the Forest Service is adding resources to be available in case of wildfire.
In Vail, the Vail Fire Department's seasonal wildfire team will show up May 3. That's a couple of weeks earlier than normal.
Paul Cada, the department's wildland fire specialist, said public education is a big part of the department's work. In fact, the department recently announced a program asking residents to complete tasks related to preparing for a wildfire. Those tasks range from signing up for community alerts to improving defensible space around homes.
""Preparedness is our big push in May,"" Cada said. ""It's really the time for folks to (act).""
At the Avon-based Eagle River Fire Protection District, community risk manager and public information officer T racy LeClair said local agencies have been conducting prescribed burns and other mitigation through the late winter and early spring.
It's a joint effort
""We've taken a much bigger role in trying to take on mitigation projects,"" LeClair said. Reducing fuel loads won't stop a wildland fire , but LeClair added that mitigation can help ease the spread of those fires.
It's a team effort to work on fire prevention and firefighting, LeClair said.
""Cooperation is the name of the game,"" she said. ""We can't do it alone.""
A warm, dry summer with below-average streamflows is also concerning news for local water providers.
Eagle River Water & Sanitation District Communications and Public Affairs Manager Diane Johnson was able to quickly rattle off several drought years in the past 20 or so.
""Droughts are getting more frequent and more severe,"" Johnson said. The goal at the district is to ""permanently reduce"" the amount of water customers use.
Most of that reduction has to come from outdoor watering. Much of the district's water supply comes from local streamflows. More than 90% of indoor water use is returned to local streams after treatment. Only about 25% of outdoor water use ends up back in streams.
Johnson urged district customers to work with their landscapers to cut back on outdoor watering.
""Far too many people are over-using water,"" Johnson said, adding that local landscapers can help
calculate how much water a yard needs, or come up with plans for attractive but water efficient landscaping .
All this and more is part of what Veldhuis called ""an all-out effort to do the right thing.""

It's time for those who live in Colorado to stop fooling themselves about the risks and impacts of wildfire.
Clearing brush around a house if it is in or anywhere near the wildland-urban interface (WUI) isn't enough. Cutting down more beetle-infested trees isn't enough. Banning outdoor burning and campfires in dry conditions isn't enough. Hoping one wet spring will stanch ongoing drought conditions isn't enough.
Until we take a holistic approach to prevent and fight wildfires, we will continue to pay the high price of larger, hotter and more frequent wildfires that will threaten our communities and ecologies for years.
It's urgent. Plans are in place for the work, so now the resources and policies must follow to ensure that things happen quickly and are sustained for the future.
State Forester Mike Lester says numerous devastating fires in the last two decades should have served as wake-up calls. But we kept hitting the snooze button.
""I would've thought the (2002) Hayman fire would've done it,"" he said. ""But I guess other things were more urgent. This last year, though, people started to realize 'you weren't kidding.'""
Many underlying conditions, such as dr2ought, that fueled the 2020 fires remain, and can't be fixed in a year, he said.
""This has to be part of our psyche going forward,"" he said of work needed to reduce wildland fire risk. ""We are never going to be done with this.""
Overwhelming amounts of data illustrate the urgent need for action, including these:
*The three largest wildland fires in state history, including one that topped 200,000 acres, occurred in 2020.
*From 2000 to 2019, about 1.7 million acres burned in wildland fires, for an average of 84,810 acres per year. In 2020 alone, 744,120 acres burned, according to Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center reports.
*Colorado's forests emit more carbon than they store, and it is one of the five worst states for forest carbon emissions, according to the 2020 report on the Health of Colorado's Forest . A big disruption to the carbon cycle is the more than 22% of standing trees that are dead wood, which release carbon instead of storing it.
*About half of the state's 5.8 million residents live in the designated 3.2 million acres of wildland-
urban interface. Government projections suggest that by 2050, the WUI acreage will surpass 9 million acres of land that will be home to 7.7 million people.
Lester and others, though, are cautiously optimistic about the attention wildfire issues now are getting at all levels of government and among state residents, and the recognition that improving foresthealth and reducing wildfire risks requires multi-pronged efforts. The legislature is adding money to the budget and in 2019 created the Colorado Fire Commission to integrate the efforts of various entities around the state.
Everyone recognizes thathealthy forests not only mitigate wildfire risk, but they provide numerous benefits: clean air and water, wildlife habitat, outdoor recreation, and forest products.
""I'm optimistic that there's a new energy in taking a look at the overall problem,"" said Mike Morgan, director of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control. ""For decades we focused on two things: mitigation of vegetation and response. And the competition (for resources) between the two.
""We need a more holistic approach or we're never going to get past it,"" he said.
That means getting a whole lot of people on board, including private landowners along with local, state, tribal and federal agencies. Colorado owns only 2.4% of its forests. Most of it, 65%, is federally owned, but 30% is privately owned. (T ribal ownership is 1.65% and local government ownership is .65%.)
It means working with utilities and emergency managers to ensure watersheds are protected, especially after fires have scarred the land and made it vulnerable to washing into streams and towns if heavy rain hits.
It means convincing homeowners to use fire-resistant materials and to cut down trees on their property. It means getting land developers to ensure people who live in the WUI have good access roads so they can get out in an emergency and firefighters can get in.
Colorado has no statewide mandates for land-use planning and development in the WUI, and many local governments have been reluctant to impose restrictions. But more and more people are seeing the benefits of mitigating risks, and collaborative projects have blossomed around the state. Examples include Wildfire Partners in Boulder County and the REALFire Program led by Realtors in Eagle County.
A couple of things have helped.
T ens of thousands of people have been evacuated during wildfires in recent years, and hundreds have lost homes and belongings. This club, to which no one wants to belong, grows every year. T raumatized as they are, these folks have helped spread the word that fire is no longer a risk you simply acknowledge if you live in a forest but a risk you must mitigate.
There is also the money issue: the cost of insurance and even the struggle to get insurance if your home is in the WUI.
""People dream of moving to Colorado and living in the mountains, but they need to understand there is a responsibility there,"" said Carole Walker, executive director of the Rocky Mountain Insurance Association, which has partnered with the Colorado Association of Realtors, among others, to educate residents and would-be residents about wildfire risks.
While there is a wealth of information and data about wildfire risks, there still are people who want to live where they want to live, build what they want to build, and leave all the trees and vegetation standing .
Building codes in some counties may allow that, but county commissioners across Colorado are increasingly taking notice that unthrottled development can increase risks for an entire community -- not only for fire but for post-fire flash flooding that can continue for decades.
Insurance companies with mounting wildfire losses throughout the mountain west have been quicker to react. And agents often are the first to deliver the message to a would-be homeowner: you must mitigate your risk or we won't insure you.
Home insurance per se is not required, but you can't get a mortgage without insurance so about 95% of primary residences are insured.
Home and property inspections in the WUI have become de rigueur and homeowners often are given precise instructions on what must be done to qualify for insurance. If they live within a community-wide mitigation program it is a bit easier as they usually can get a certificate of compliance thathelps with rates, Walker said.
She noted that many homes being built in mountain communities are second homes, and they increasingly are large and expensive.
If that's the case, it seems to me there's little excuse for not using fire-resistant materials and reducing fuels near the home. Maybe we could work to make concrete homes trendy.
The range of fire-resistant building materials has increased, but they tend to add cost and don't always fit with what a person wants to build, said Josh Peterson, with Vanguard Homes and Viceroy Development in Colorado Springs.
Peterson, who was on the team thathelped Colorado Springs develop a home design manual for building in the WUI, said he's on board with the concept of mitigating fire risk but wishes there was more ""out of the box thinking.""
For example, if a builder wants to combine materials such as popular tongue and groove deck coverings and code X drywall that has been code tested individually but not as a system they can't do it without a costly system test.
Meeting the architectural desires of homeowners and the requirements of building and fire codes is sometimes tough, he said. Despite the frustrations, he lauded the collaboration and communication from fire and government officials that have helped everyone educate the public.
That is key to the holistic approach being pursued, but the experts recognize we're not there yet.
""We've got to do the right work at the personal, community and state level,"" Walker said. ""You'd think we'd be there, and we are getting there, but it's still a road ahead.""
Everyone can help Colorado restore its forests and mitigate the risks of wildland fires, most of which are human-caused.

Our Future on Fire
March 12, 2021  Sky-Hi News (Granby, CO)
Author: Scott Condon For the Aspen Times Weekly Section: News 1502 Words
OpenURL Link
Colorado's 2020-wildfireseason provided a glimpse at what climate change has wrought and it is an
unsettling view.
The Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires provided a devastating one-two punch to northern
Colorado and became the two most destructive wildfires in the state's history late last summer and fall.
On the West Slope, the Pine Gulch Fire north of Grand Junction was temporarily the state's record-setter
after burning more than 139,000 acres in August and September.
Closer to home, the Grizzly Creek Fire wasn't on the scale of those blazes but presented extraordinary
threats to infrastructure in Glenwood Canyon. Interstate 70 was shut down for two weeks. There were
disruptions to railroad service and threats the city of Glenwood Springs water supply. The economy of
the region took a hit at a time already made challenging by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now there are big
questions for Glenwood Canyon in the fire's aftermath (see related story).
Colorado's forests were once regarded as more fireproof than those in the northern Rockies and
California due to high elevations and generally wet conditions. But the 2002 drought and devastating fire
conditions proved Colorado wasn't invulnerable and foreshadowed conditions to come. The drought was
one of the most severe in Colorado's history. Ithelped the spread of the Hayman Creek Fire, which
covered narly 138,000 acres and destroyed 133 residences. It was the state's largest wildfire until 2020.
Closer to home, the Roaring Fork Valley suffered an eye-opening threat with the Lake Christine Fire in
Philip Higuera, an associate professor and wildfire researcher at the University of Montana, said 2020 is
a sign that we must adapt.
""Years like 2020 will be more common,"" he said. ""That's almost certain.
""Very broadly, it is clear with climate change over the last several decades and in particular in the 21st
century, all forests throughout the West generally and in Colorado are becoming more flammable
because of climate and because summers are becoming warming and drier,"" Higuera said.
In a March 4 virtual presentation for the Wilderness Workshop-Aspen Center for Environmental Studies'
Naturalist Nights series and in a separate interview with The Aspen Times, Higuera discussed whathe
has learned as director of the PaleoEcology Lab and Fire Ecology Lab at the University of Montana. He
has studied natural clues to wildfire activity over the last 6,000 years in the area that now encompasses
Rocky Mountain National Park, so he is uniquely capable of putting current times into perspective.
""What I've been saying is 2020 kind of punctuates this trend we've been seeing over the last several
decades,"" Higuera said.
Those trends include a warmer and drier climate, increasing fire activity and growing prevalence of
humans in fire-prone landscapes.
""Here's the kicker for me and what's been most surprising about 2020  in some sense it seems like
2020 in combination with the rest of the 21st century is kicking these high elevation subalpine forests into
territory they haven't been in in recent millennia,"" he said.
One way that Higuera and his colleagues study wildfire history is by collecting and examining sediment
in high altitude lakes. Preserved pine needles help them determine the dominant species of trees during
various eras. Ash layers help determine periods of wildfire.
There was a warm period from about 800 to 1,000 AD that accommodated high wildfire activity, though
not as high as it has been recently. Averaging out the variability in the past, subalpine forests were
experiencing wildfire about once every 200 years, according to Higuera.
That's changing. We're now in uncharted territory.
""Really to my surprise, what we've found is the 21st century is kicking this area outside of the historical
range of variability,"" he said. ""This is the fire rotation period now  112 years. Basically it means we're
burning at about twice the rate that these forests have experienced in the past. If we zoom into the last
decade, it's even more extreme.
""Rocky Mountain subalpine forests now appear to be burning more than any time in the past millennia,""
he continued. ""That is something that kind of had been predicted, but it's happening earlier than we
thought. The impacts of climate change are upon us sooner than we thought.""
Wildfires are also tending to be more destructive. Within a fire boundary, there is typically a mosaic of
activity. There are some areas of intense fire severity, where vegetation is nearly all burned up, and
areas of moderate and low severity. In general, Higuera said, there are now more fires with more intense
burning. He noted with a degree of amazement that the East Troublesome Fire jumped the Continental
Divide at 12,000 feet in Rocky Mountain National Park last year.
The history of fire suppression in the U.S. since the early 1900s hasn'thelped the situation.
The U.S. Forest Service followed a policy for decades of snuffing every wildfire. That stopped a process
that benefited forests by encouraging regeneration and age diversity of trees. Fire suppression created a
heavy buildup of fuels. Add drier conditions and more human presence, and it is a recipe for disaster.
Higuera said forest ecosystems have proven remarkably resilient in the past. Natural regeneration
followed fires and led to healthy forests dominated by Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir trees.
Now, it's uncertain forests will bounce back in a warmer, drier world. Forests might be thinner. Tree
species might change. Aspen trees might be more dominant, assuming there is enough precipitation to
allow them to flourish.
In some ways, Higuera said, the mold is set.
""Some of this increase in flammability, we're going to be living with it for years or decades to come,"" he
said.
Buthe also sees these circumstances as an important call to action. He said the current conditions
make him more worried for the human community than the non-human ecosystems. The ecosystems
adapt.
""I think the more pressing challenge short-term is to figure out how we live in the high country  places
like Grand Lake and Aspen and all these communities that are tucked into subalpine and lower elevation
forests that are quite flammable,"" Higuera said.
All told, about 7.4 million acres burned throughout the West in 2020. An estimated 10,000 structures were
damaged or destroyed. Higuera said researchers have concluded that about one-half of that acreage
would have burned naturally from causes such as lightning strikes. About one-half was due to human
activity, from ignition and climate change.
Humanity needs to take climate change seriously and act on a global scale, he said. On the local level,
people living in and adjacent to forests need to take wildfire protection planning seriously. That means
incorporating rather than opposing fuel reduction projects.
""Recognize that a do-nothing option is not really a great, viable option for moving forward,"" Higuera said.
""That can make some people uncomfortable who really love forests and love trees and don't want to see
trees removed from forests in fuel reduction efforts.
""It kind of comes down to, if we want to live in these flammable landscapes, we need to accept that
they're going to be transformed,"" Higuera continued. ""They're going to be transformed with or without us
participating.""
AFTER THE FLAMES, WILDFIRE RISKS PERSIST
Flames aren't the only problem created by wildfires.
After a record-breaking wildfireseason, Colorado now faces the aftermath in the burn scars. Mother
Nature will determine the severity of events such as mudslides, debris flows and flash floods in 2021 and
into coming years.
In Glenwood Canyon, the U.S. Forest Service and Colorado Department of Transportation are gauging
the potential for problems such as the closure of Interstate 70 and popular recreational amenities such as
the Glenwood Canyon bicycle path and Hanging Lake Trail.
The fire burned up steep slopes, charring the vegetation that anchored rocks and dirt in place. The
canyon was already notorious for rockfall. Now the risk is magnified, according to Steve Hunter, a former
engineer with the White River National Forest and a member of its Burned Area Emergency Response
team.
The BAER team's assessment showed that 12 percent of the terrain within the perimeter of the fire
suffered a high level of burn severity, 43 percent was moderate, 33 percent was low and 12 percent was
unburned.
The Forest Service started with emergency repairs to trails and roads last fall and will continue as
weather allows this spring. Partner agencies are installing rain gauges to help with forecasts for flooding
and debris flows.
Despite the precautions, an extended downpour could result in trouble for Interstate 70, the railroad line,
the Glenwood Springs water supply and numerous recreational amenities.
The Grizzly Creek Fire topped out at 32,631 acres. The potential for problems is magnified by the
Colorado mega-fires of 2020. The East Troublesome Fire covered 193,812 acres, originating northnortheast of Kremmling.
To the east of that fire, across the Continental Divide, the Cameron Peak Fire topped out at 208,913
acres, 25 miles east of Walden and 15 miles southwest of Red Feather Lakes.

Holy Cross Energy adopts more aggressive clean energy goal.txt,"Holy Cross Energy adopts more aggressive clean energy goal
December 15, 2020  Aspen Times, The (CO)
Author: Scott Condon scondon@aspentimes.com Section: Local 798 Words
OpenURL Link
Holy Cross Energy solidified its role as an innovator in the power industry Monday with an
announcement it will speed up its efforts to convert to 100% renewable sources.
The electric cooperative unveiled its 10030 initiative  providing 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030.
Its previous goal was to achieve 70% clean energy by 2030.
""Make no mistake, this is an ambitious goal,"" HCE president and CEO Bryan Hannegan said Monday
during a video conference. ""It's one of the most aggressive renewable energy and greenhouse gas
reductions goals anywhere in the country.""
Holy Cross serves 44,000 members in the Roaring Fork Valley and along the Interstate 70 corridor in
western Colorado. For residents and businesses that want to offset their carbon emissions, Holy Cross'
direction will be a major step in achieving the goal.
Dave Munk, chair of the Holy Cross board of directors, said the cooperative's actions reflect its
members' demands.
""There are many voices calling for bold action on climate,"" Munk said on the video conference. ""Many of
our members are among those voices.""
The move was hailed from outside the organization as placing Holy Cross at the forefront of battling
climate change. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said when he was campaigning for his position two years
ago, he announced a goal of the state achieving 100% clean energy by 2040. Holy Cross is ""setting the
bar,"" he said.
""Today's announcement shows that even though at the time my ideas were bold, apparently they weren't
bold enough for Holy Cross,"" Polis said on the conference. ""I'm so excited to see Holy Cross leading the
way.""
Amory Lovins, co-founder, chief scientist and CEO of Rocky Mountain Institute, said coal-fired power
plants are inefficient to operate. The investment in solar and wind power is offset by less expensive
operating costs.
""Holy Cross is among the first that figured this out,"" he said.
He credited Hannegan, a former leading researcher with the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden,
for taking whathe learned and applying it ""in the sandbox."" The actions of Holy Cross could inspire other
energy providers to follow its example.
""Holy Cross is small enough to be nimble but large enough to be effective,"" he said.
Auden Schendler, senior vice president for sustainability and community engagement at Aspen Skiing
Co., was among members of the public who watched the Holy Cross video conference Monday.
""This is the pure vision, pure leadership, steel-in-the-ground workmanship we need right now,"" Schendler
said via email. ""Think about it: less than a decade from now, every hotel, every restaurant, every ski lift
(in Holy Cross territory) will be running carbon-free. And less than 20 years ago, Holy Cross was 5
percent renewable and had just purchased part of a new coal plant. This is what it looks like to solve the
climate problem.""
Hannegan stressed during the announcement that Holy Cross' goal was not just aspirational. Holy Cross
established a ""line of sight"" in September 2018 when it set its 70%clean energy goal for 2030.
In 2017, the company was at 39% renewable energy. It is now up to 44% and positioned to climb fast. It's
contracted for development of 100 megawatts of new wind resources and 30 megawatts of new solar
resources, according to its website. It has also arranged to sell off the 60 megawatts of energy output
from its share of the Comanche Unit 3 coal-fired plant in Pueblo.
Holy Cross also is finalizing contracts to buy power from several clean energy projects in its service
area, including a 5-megawatt solar project near Woody Creek, scheduled for ground breaking in the
spring, and a 4.5-megawatt project at Colorado Mountain College's Spring Valley campus outside of
Glenwood Springs.
With the 70% renewable plan by 2030 ahead of schedule, the HCE board ""felt it appropriate to set a more
ambitious clean energy goal in response to the growing urgency of addressing the risks posed by
climate change,"" the company's website said.
A parallel goal is to offset all of its greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2035. In addition to providing
100% clean and renewable energy five years earlier, it wants to make 100% of its operations carbonfree, including fuel for its fleet of vehicles.
As part of its 10030 strategic plan, Holy Cross will continue to work with residential and business
members on energy efficiency, provide rebates for many projects undertaken.
Holy Cross also has pledged that its push to renewable energy won't come at the expense of members'
pocketbooks.
Munk said switching to renewable energy actually will bring down costs.
""We do anticipate keeping our rates down at least through 2021,"" he said.
Lovins noted that President-elect Joe Biden has set a goal of carbon-free electricity by 2035. Achieving
the goal will depend on innovation such as that displayed by Holy Cross Energy, Lovins said.
""It's terrific leadership,"" he said.

Hotter than ever August was the warmest driest month in west.txt,"Hotter than ever: August was the warmest, driest month in western
Colorado history  what does that mean for Routt County?
September 19, 2020  Steamboat Pilot & Today (CO)
Author: Derek Maiolo dmaiolo@SteamboatPilot.com Section: Environment 1534 Words
OpenURL Link
STEAMBOAT SPRINGS  This has been a record-breaking summer for Routt County, but it's no
cause for celebration.
Last month was the hottest, driest August on record for western Colorado, according to Russ
Schumacher, Colorado's state climatologist and director of the Colorado Climate Center. He was one of
three expert panelists who spoke at the third Yampa Basin Rendezvous discussion Thursday, which
focused on changes in temperatures and precipitation amid what they described as a rapidly changing
climate.
Routt County isn't the only place topping charts. In its 2020 State of the Climate report, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Association said the year is gearing up to be the planet's second-warmest
year in 141 years of temperature records. The warmest year thus far was 2016.
According to Schumacher, ""These changes are going to affect the water cycle and everything that
depends on it, which is pretty much everything.""
Among the most pressing threats climate change poses to Routt County are higher temperatures,
reduced snowpack, increased risk of wildfires, more severe droughts and more extreme weather,
according to a 2018 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory. These would cause residual impacts to the
local economy that depends on the ecosystem for everything from tourism to farming and to public
health and safety, the report adds.
A parched Yampa Valley
To get a more complete picture of drought conditions, Schumacher presented graphs showing how
temperature impacts dryness in the Yampa and White River basins. The graphs use the Standardized
Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, which takes into account temperature, precipitation and
evapotranspiration, or the moisture the earth loses to the atmosphere from both evaporation and
transpiration from plants.
Hotter temperatures mean the earth loses more moisture to a thirstier atmosphere. Using this index,
Schumacher showed how extremely dry August was, far surpassing any records from the last century.
Unprecedented drought conditions pose serious risks to the Yampa Valley, from natural ecosystems to
the people who depend on the health of those ecosystems. Ranchers have had an especially hard time
this summer as they struggle to water their crops. For the second time ever, water managers placed a
call on the main stretch of the Yampa River in August, meaning certain water users had to stop or curb
their usage.
Longtime Steamboat Springs rancher Adonna Allen said her senior water rights meant she was not as
affected by the call as some of her neighbors, but the dry summer has caused problems for everyone in
agriculture.
Those growing hay have seen anywhere from 25% to 45% reductions in yields, Allen said. To make up
for the loss, Allen had to convert pastures her family normally uses for grazing their cattle into hay fields,
pastures she has not touched in 10 years.
""We knew we needed the extra hay to get through the winter,"" she explained.
Allen considers herself lucky to have the option to add extra hay fields. Other operations have been
forced to purchase hay, which has ramped up demand and therefore the cost.
""The price of hay right now has just skyrocketed,"" Allen said.
Feeling the heat
Among the most devastating effects of hot, arid conditions for Colorado has been the propensity for large
wildfires. The Pine Gulch Fire, sparked by lightning July 31 near Grand Junction, is the state's largest
wildfire in Colorado history. As of Friday, it was more than 139,000 acres in size and 95% contained,
following about six weeks of firefighting efforts.
The Middle Fork Fire, 10 miles north of Steamboat, had grown to 5,445 acres Friday, according to the
U.S. Forest Service. It continues to spread, fueled by gusting winds and dry weather.
Even after the flames are extinguished, such massive wildfires pose long-term hazards, such as flash
flooding, mudslides and debris flow.
It isn't just the environment that suffers. The consequences of a hotter, drier state have posed several
health hazards for local communities.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued multiple air quality advisories for
Routt County this week due to heavy smoke from the Middle Fork Fire in North Routt and out-of-state
wildfires. The latest advisory is in effect through Saturday morning.
It recommends people stay indoors if smoke is thick, particularly for those with heart disease, respiratory
illness, the very young and the elderly. People should consider limiting their time outside when moderate
to heavy smoke is in the air, according to the advisory, and possibly relocate if smoke gets indoors and
starts to make people sick.
""If visibility is less than 5 miles in smoke in your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are
unhealthy,"" the advisory states.
Protecting winter
Looking ahead to winter, warmer and drier conditions do not bode well for powder-hungry skiers and
riders.
Snowpack across Colorado has been thinning since the 1950s, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency, with losses as much as 60% at some measurement sites. Scientists from Colorado
State University and the University of New Hampshire project further reductions in snowpack by the end
of the century, with losses as high as 30% in some areas.
That said, the northern mountains, including the area of Steamboat Resort, are less vulnerable to
decreases in snowpack than southern parts of Colorado, Schumacher said. This is because the weather
patterns that can deliver large snowfall are more dependable than farther south, where he described
winters as either ""boom or bust.""
The Farmer's Almanac, in its extended winter forecast for 2020-21, predicted ""above-normal snowfall"" for
northern portions of Colorado. Of course, even five-day weather forecasts can be unreliable, as Yampa
Valley residents know particularly well, and a single winter is not indicative of broader trends.
Sarah Jones, Steamboat Ski & Resort Corp.'s first-ever director of sustainability and community
engagement, said the effects of climate change are becoming major talking points in the resort's
decision-making and future planning. Jones, the former executive director of the Yampa Valley
Sustainability Council, was hired last year amid efforts to improve the resort's environmental impact and
pursue goals related to climate and energy.
""We are dependent on snow. We are dependent on the river, and both will be impacted by climate
change,"" Jones said, not just of the resort but of the broader community that relies on winter tourism.
In the past, Ski Corp. has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to local environmental efforts such
as the Yampa River Fund and the Yampa Valley Sustainability Council.
As Jones explained, the COVID-19 pandemic has stalled some progress with sustainability goals and
climate action investments as the ski area and its parent company, Alterra Mountain Co., grapple with
widespread disruptions. Still, Jones said she has several projects in the works, with the help of a
consultant, to make the resort more energy efficient and offset their carbon footprint with the use of
renewables.
Taking action
All is not lost in the fight against the negative effects of climate change. Where there are problems, there
are also people like Jones working toward solutions.
Locally, the city of Steamboat and Routt County are collaborating on a climate action plan with support
from Steamboat Resort and the Steamboat Springs Chamber. Local leaders are exploring solutions
around five distinct areas: energy, transportation, land use, waste, education and advocacy.
Jones is a member of the project management team overseeing the creation of the plan, which is
scheduled for adoption by the end of the year. The team recently conducted a survey to get the public's
feedback about what actions and projects the community should prioritize in the years ahead.
The city and county hired an outside consultant, Lotus Engineering and Sustainability, LLC., which is
putting together recommendations for green projects from various local industry groups, such as Yampa
Valley Electric Association and Atmos Energy.
During the Yampa Basin Rendezvous on Thursday, panelist Courtney Peterson, a coordinator for the
Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science, talked about broader efforts to help ecosystems prepare
for and survive a rapidly changing climate.
Her institute developed the Climate Change Response Framework, which is meant to be a guide to help
organizations and communities tailor projects that work best for their unique situations when it comes to
natural resource management. As she explained, a one-size-fits-all approach does not work for the
myriad of ways climate change impacts different parts of the country.
Personalizing strategies is not only more effective, she said, ithelps a diverse range of landowners and
local leaders support environmental efforts.
For example, the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science worked with Indigenous tribes in the
Northeast and Midwest to take their cultural values into consideration and use their ecological knowledge
to come up with creative solutions.
""Their input was very valuable in this process. Building trust and reciprocity was important,"" Peterson
said.
She encouraged landowners and organizations in the Yampa Valley to see how they could use the
Climate Change Response Framework and an adaptation workbook to guide their own projects. To
download the workbook, visit adaptationworkbook.org.
There also are two free, eight-week courses on the framework. The first begins Sept. 28, and the other
begins Jan. 25, 2021. To register and learn more, visit forestadaptation.org.
""These tools are really helpful,"" Peterson said, ""but ultimately your knowledge and expertise, especially in
the Yampa River Basin, is going to be crucial.""

Hot_dry_conditions_produce_another_active__Aspen_Times_The_CO___April_9_2021.txt,"Ho t, dry co nditio ns p ro duce ano the r active - Asp e n T ime s, The (CO ) - Ap ril 9, 2021
Colorado homeowners who live where forests abut civilization -- like most of the Roaring Fork Valley -- are being urged by state and local public safety officials to buckle up for another potentially active fire season.
Warm temperatures, low humidity and high winds have already ramped up the fire danger.
""After last week, we're in fire season now,"" said Roaring Fork Fire Rescue Chief Scott T hompson.
Aspen Fire Department already responded to a small wildland fire along McLain Flats Road when a bird hit a power line Wednesday. The fire was snuffed after it burned one-half acre.
Longer-term weather forecasts don't give much hope for relief. Although rain and snow are in the Roaring Fork Valley's forecast next week, the National Interagency Fire Center's Predictive Services division foresees warmer and drier conditions than average for most of Colorado's mountains through June.
""Everything is shaping up to be the same as last year, and that scares the hell out of me,"" T hompson said.
Valerie MacDonald, director of Pitkin County Emergency Management, said the county was the only one in northwest Colorado that didn't experience a significant wildfire last summer.
""There is no reason to believe our luck will continue to hold, and everyone needs to prepare for wildfire,"" she said.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis held a news conference Thursday with top state public safety officials to discuss the fire outlook. It was a sobering message.
""Historically, wildfireseasons in Colorado were a four-month period of time,"" said Mike Morgan, director of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control. ""Since the 1970s, our fire seasons have expanded and they are more than 78 days longer. We're having fire years not fire seasons anymore.""
Sustained drought and climate change are altering Colorado's forests, scientists have said.
Four of the five largest fires in Colorado's history have occurred in the past three years, Morgan said, and 15 of the state's 20 largest fires have occurred since 2012.
Last year was the worst for wildfires in Colorado's history, with about 600,000 acres burned. The Cameron Peak Fire destroyed or damaged 224 residences and set a record for acres burned at 298,913. The East Troublesome Fire covered 193,812 acres. They both burned in national forest in the central mountains. The Pine Gulch Fire north of Grand Junction was temporarily the largest in
the state's history at 139,007 acres, mostly on Bureau of Land Management holdings.
Columns of smoke drifting up from the Grizzly Creek Fire in Glenwood Canyon in August rattled the nerves of Roaring Fork Valley residents. The Lake Christine Fire, which threatened Basalt, El Jebel and much of Missouri Heights in July 2018, is still fresh on many residents' minds.
Eagle County officials say virtually all of the Roaring Fork portion of the county is located in the wildland-urban interface -- the terrain susceptible to wildfires. Many of the homes in Pitkin County also are in that susceptible terrain.
State and local officials are taking additional steps to prepare for the 2021 wildfireseason. T hompson said Roaring Fork Fire Rescue is getting its wildland firefighting equipment prepared earlier than usual and is already refreshing training for firefighters.
The Pitkin County Public Safety Council is focusing on evacuation plans for various scenarios, including situations where a wildfire forces Aspen residents to depart over Independence Pass.
The council met via teleconference with the sheriff of Grand County, which was in the thick of the East Troublesome Fire last year. The area faced many of the same challenges confronting the Roaring Fork Valley -- how to get people to safety in a narrow valley with a limited number of roads.
On the state level, the Colorado Legislature has approved funding for contracts that extend the season for single-engine tankers and helicopters. Those resources are in addition to air support available to federal agencies. Morgan said having extra resources for longer periods would allow the state to stage aggressive initial attacks to knock down fires before they become destructive.
Last year there were roughly 5,300 wildland fires in Colorado, he said. The vast majority of them were small and knocked down quickly with local, state and federal crews working collaboratively.
Morgan and other state officials stressed at Thursday's news conference that fire mitigation would be required to ease the threat of wildfires in Colorado over the years. That includes thinning trees through timber sales and mechanical treatments and, when conditions are favorable, using prescribed burns where firefighters purposely light fires to achieve beneficial results.
Individual homeowners also are being asked to help. MacDonald, the Pitkin County emergency manager, said, ""everyone needs to do their part."" That includes creating defensible space around their homes, using fire resistant materials, signing up for emergency alerts and having an evacuation plan.
""We will continue to see wildfire, so we need to become fire adaptive, in other words, learn to live with wildfire,"" MacDonald said.
T hompson said Roaring Fork Valley residents can call their fire department to arrange a free assessment of what they should do to make their properties less susceptible to wildfire and ""harden"" their homes against wildfire risk. The homeowners will be responsible for following up on the work.
T hompson said homeowner interest in the assessments and following through on the work is a mixed bag.
""We see upticks, then it slows down,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say (the response) is overwhelming.""
Since now is open-burning season of ditches and dry grasses on agricultural lands, T hompson said property owners should go online at the fire department's website to get a permit. They also should use precautions, like avoiding intentional burns during high winds.

Houses_must_be_built_to_withstand_wildfire___Tribune_The_Gleneagle_Black_Forest_CO___October_14_2020.txt,"Ho use s must be built to withstand wildfire  - T ribune , The (Gle ne agle , Black Fo re st, CO ) - O cto be r 14, 20 20

That the scene has become familiar makes it no less wrenching: A distraught couple searches through the ash, char, and melted metal of what was once their home. Only the concrete pad and the fireplace remain.
What is also in that tableau -- but hardly noticed -- are trees. A few are killed and many are scorched, but most are alive and green. The house vaporized because it could not cope with fire; the forest survived because it could. And paradoxically, it was the house fire that killed the trees.
Those early-kindled houses cast fire to neighbors. What began as a wildland fire amplified into an urban conflagration. It's the sort of scene that was common in the American frontier over a century ago. Watching it burn through Paradise or Berry Creek, Calif., today is like watching smallpox or polio return.
Before-and-after photos of a devastated neighborhood reinforce the sense that a tsunami of fire rushed through and crushed the community. Images of soaring flame-fronts ahead of the town pair with post-burn moonscapes of ruin after the fire has passed. Our desire for a narrative fills in the storyline with a moving line of flame, telling us to attack the wildfire before it can breach the perimeter.
Yet detailed studies, over and over, move the primary problem from the source, where the fire comes from, to the ""sink,"" where the flames go. A tidal wave of fire we can't stop. But the threatening fire actually moves into and through the town more like a blizzard of sparks: If there are places of vulnerability, embers will find them.
That is why the best defense is to harden our houses. Surviving fires depends on what fire researchers call the ""home ignition zone"" (HIZ). Flammable roofs, vegetation next to wood siding or porches, open eaves, cracks in paneling, vent meshing too large to stop sparks, ground cover that can carry fire along the surrounding surface or radiate heat sufficient to crack window glass -- all are chinks that fire can exploit.
Since structures typically occupy a setting with other structures, the vulnerability of each depends on the vulnerability of its neighbors, and a town itself might be likened to a rambling structure that also needs defensible space.
Zoning, greenbelts, and codes regulating the relative risk of collective housing won't halt embers, but they can make protecting hardened structures easier and safer. Call that expanded site the ""housing environmental risk zone"" (HERZ).
The reality is, we can't abolish fire in the countryside and shouldn't want to. A century of trying has taught us we can't muster a counterforce to halt the conflagrations that cause most of the damage. Even attempting to eliminate all fires only disrupts ecological benefits and lets fuels build
up that create the conditions for even worse fires. So while the fire source does matter, the fire sink matters more.
We've lived through waves of fire like this before, twice. The country endured a horrific chronicle of conflagrations with agricultural settlement through the 19th and early 20th centuries. It suffered through routine city infernos that burned like their surrounding landscapes since they were made of the same materials. Both faded away a century ago.
The last big urban outbreak occurred when San Francisco burned in 1906. The last big rural community that burned during the 1918 fires occurred outside the town of Cloquet, Minnesota. It killed 435 people, some while fleeing in their automobiles.
In recent decades the country has recolonized formerly rural lands with an urban outmigration. Most are exurbs that don't rely on a rural economy or use fire in traditional ways. The fire susceptibility that resulted, however, was identified by the wildland fire community as houses crowding into wildlands.
Do that, and it is clear what measures must be taken to protect them from fire. You apply the same strategies and techniques that earlier removed fire from cityscapes. Meanwhile, the wildland-urban fire problem has been unnecessarily complicated because it got mis-defined.
It will prove tricky to unwind, because so many communities built in the flush times will have to be retrofitted to accommodate the current conditions. The good news is that HIZ, HERZ, and history show us where to concentrate the effort. The bad news is that there isn't much time to dawdle.

How three subdivisions came to embrace wildfire mitigation S.txt,"How three subdivisions came to embrace wildfire mitigation Sometimes, it takes a close call, or worse, to spur action
June 2, 2021  Durango Herald, The (CO)
Author: Shannon Mullane Section: Local News 1957 Words
OpenURL Link
As the Missionary Ridge Fire raged in 2002, the Valley Fire, a second fire, broke out and destroyed six
homes within hours near the Falls Creek Ranch subdivision north of Durango.
When residents returned after the Valley Fire, they saw red and green ribbons hanging on trees next to
driveways and houses.
Red, they learned, meant firefighters were not able to defend their homes during the fire. The brush and
trees were too overgrown for firefighters to access safely, said Paulette Church, a resident of 22 years,
recalling a community discussion with fire officials after the fire.
""When we came home from the meeting that day, you could hear chainsaws all over the ranch,"" Church
said. ""People were trimming up their junipers and oak brush. ... Everyone was looking at what they had
around their house very differently.""
Close calls with wildfire have spurred several La Plata County communities into action on wildfire risk
mitigation. But getting a community to keep that momentum can be a puzzle  one that takes years,
even decades, to solve.
About 3,500 structures burn each year in the United States by wildfire. Reducing risks, such as
hazardous plant life near buildings, before a fire can help communities adapt to living with fire, according
to the U.S. Forest Service.
But not everyone is ready or willing to invest the time, effort or money to mitigate. Three La Plata County
community mitigation leaders say a mixture of know-how, a sense of community and neighborly
persuasion can help.
""Changing attitudes is the most difficult thing you can do,"" said Church, who has been nationally
recognized for her role in the Falls Creek community mitigation effort.
More than 70,000 communities and 44 million homes nationally are at risk from wildfire in the wildland
urban interface, or WUI, where vegetative fuels and the built environment meet.
That includes communities in La Plata County, like Durango. On wildfire risk maps, the city is
surrounded by seas of reds and oranges indicating higher-than-average wildfire risk.
There are many ways to reduce that risk, such as creating community wildfire protection plans,
defensible spaces around structures like homes and businesses, and carefully chosen construction
materials and building codes, according to the Forest Service.
Many people move to subdivisions in the WUI, such as Falls Creek, Rafter J Association and Elk
Stream Ranch, because they want to live within a wildland environment.
The residents value seeing wildlife inhabiting nearby trees or wandering through bushes, and they want
to protect the ""natural"" forest landscape. Some resist cutting down plant life, even when it's limited to
hazardous fuels, according to mitigation leaders in some communities.
Several communities have bylaws prohibiting tree removal to preserve the forest and worry that
assessing risks might deter people from moving to the area or negatively impact insurance rates.
Removing hazardous plant life can be too time-intensive or costly for some residents. Others are
interested but do not know where to start.
""I think a lot of people are concerned that if they take too many trees out, it's not going to have that forest
feel or it's not going to be healthy for the forest,"" said Charlie Landsman, La Plata County coordinator for
the Wildfire Adapted Partnership, a nonprofit that connects communities to mitigation resources.
""Really, when it comes down to it, fire mitigation is directly beneficial for the forest,"" Landsman said. ""The
forests are over-densely populated because of our historical fire suppression.""
Wake-up call
In La Plata County, 85 community volunteers with the Wildfire Adapted Partnership, called firewise
ambassadors, in 61 communities are trying to get their neighbors involved in pruning back hazardous
plant life.
For three of those communities interviewed by The Durango Herald, it was a brush with wildfire that
ultimately motivated residents to take action.
The Rafter J Association, about 7 miles southwest of Durango, is a subdivision within the Rafter J
Ranch. Its 170 homes are built on ridgetops with views of gullies and ravines, said Lou Fontana, a
firewise ambassador and resident of 21 years.
In 2017, the Lightner Creek Fire burned 412 acres within sight of Fontana's home.
""You could see what was going on down there for most of the people on Ridge Road,"" Fontana said. ""At
one point, they did a pre-evacuation order for Rafter J.""
Before the fire, fewer than 10 people in the Rafter J subdivision were regularly mitigating their land.
""The most we've had participate is 90  which is good, but it's still not 100% participation,"" Fontana said.
Elk Stream Ranch, made up of 35 lots and 15 homes, sits in East Canyon along the border between
Montezuma and La Plata counties. The residents created a community wildfire protection plan in 2008.
""I remember hearing about the local fire department saying they might not come into our canyon if they
cannot safely do so,"" said Gertine ""Gem"" Ganje-Boone, a firewise ambassador for Elk Stream since
2012. ""Well, that's a pretty good wake-up call. Then of course, there is nothing more convincing than an
actual fire.""
In 2012, the Weber Fire swept through the area, burning 10,000 acres. Then came the 2,905-acre East
Canyon Fire in 2020.
""I would say everyone that has a home participates in some form of fire mitigation,"" Ganje-Boone said.
""It's much harder to convince vacant landowners to participate in fire mitigation, but we have had
success with about half of the lots.""
In Durango, it was only after the 416 Fire burned 52,778 acres in 2018 that city and La Plata County
leaders began several concerted efforts to leverage community, state and federal partnerships to
address the area's wildfire risk.
""There's an incredible amount of work being done on pretty much every level, from homeowners to the
city, county, state and federal level,"" Landsman said. ""One of the main limiting factors is there's always
going to be more to do. And there's only so much capacity, people, time and energy to do the work on
the ground.""
Falls Creek residents have volunteered thousands of hours since 2002 to mitigate fire risk on their land
and roads. In 2018, that work helped firefighters redirect the 416 Fire. After nearly two decades, about
80% of the 96 households in Falls Creek remove plant life from communal property each year and about
90% of the landowners mitigate their own properties.
It's a high percentage, but there are still ""hold outs"" who don't want to mitigate, Church said.
""There's only a couple,"" Church said. ""And they've done more than we ever did before.""
Finding solutions
The neighborhood mitigation leaders found success through a mix of community-building events,
continuous outreach, financial assistance and results.
At community meetings, Rafter J brought in fire experts from the Durango Fire Protection District, the
Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service and Wildfire Adapted Partnership. Their first step:
drafting a community preparedness assessment, Fontana said.
They focused on road improvements, then clearing the ignition zone around homes. They used grants to
pay for mitigation projects, such as cutting and chipping scrub oak, which went over budget because of
higher-than-expected participation, Fontana said.
""I would like to see it codified that you couldn't sell property in any community in Southwest Colorado
without proper mitigation being included,"" he said. ""You require a septic system, you require mitigation.
Do it.""
In Elk Stream Ranch, ambassadors speak at annual meetings and hand out literature, continually
bringing information back to the community. The association used a cost-share program to create fuel
breaks along roads and is seeking grant funding to continue the project, said Ganje-Boone.
When it comes to creating a community consensus, Ganje-Boone said she focuses on the idea of
""when,"" not ""if,"" a wildfire will come.
""Being better prepared is key to saving lives and property,"" she said. ""Having conversations with your
neighbors and volunteering to help has worked for our community.""
Falls Creek ambassadors, like Church, also continually send out educational information about reducing
wildfire risk. The neighborhood brought in experts to help identify mitigation projects. Residents have
used grants and other funding sources to complete thousands of hours of mitigation projects.
Landsman has worked with dozens of communities on fire mitigation projects with the Wildfire Adapted
Partnership. Addressing concerns, he said, comes down to having open and honest conversations with
people.
""Learning what their concerns are, instead of going in there and saying, 'You need to do this, and here
are the reasons you need to do it,'"" he said.
Church's secret to success: the potluck.
""After you work together on a project like that, everyone is really tired, hot and dirty,"" she said. ""You
come together and you celebrate ... and you see the results immediately. It builds an enthusiasm and a
shared vision for what a healthy forest looks like.""
Seeing the results of mitigation projects  that did not include clear-cutting the forest, as some neighbors
feared  helped convince more people to participate over time.
""People thought ... our forest would never burn. There was no risk. When they saw the Valley Fire and
Missionary Ridge burn, there was risk,"" Church said. ""Seeing people they respected do the work, they
realized 'Yeah, I don't want to be the neighbor to burn my neighbor's house down. I want to do my
share.'""

LETTERS: We're awash in open space; housing issue solutions
needed

We're awash in open space
Susan Davies contends a recent poll indicates majority support for a significant increase to the TOPS
tax and a 20-year sunset. While her contention is supported in the results of the poll, she didn't mention
some other insights that the publicly available survey reveals.
When pollsters proposed a TOPS tax increase framed within a 30-word limit, they concluded ""...neither
the .15% or the .25% tax amount registers majority support."" The pollsters also concluded ""... a tax
continuation measure which is not limited in word count registers overwhelming support"". With the 30word limit vanquished in April, perhaps we'll see a wordy TOPS ballot initiative in the next election.
Even with an unlimited number of words, what that ballot issue won't say is that we're awash in open
space. According to the 2019 City Park Facts from the Trust for Public Lands for the 100 largest U.S.
cities, the median acreage of parkland per 1,000 residents is 13. Colorado Springs, rated in the top third,
has almost twice that (23.1). However, the number of city parkland acres counted in the survey (about
9,000) doesn't count the 8,000 acres of parkland that El Paso County owns, most of which adjoins the
city. The 1.1 million acres of public open space that describes our adjacent Pike National Forest also
stands outside that count.
In a community with a low tolerance for any tax and vast open space resources this paradox should
stand out. The TOPS tax might not be unpopular, but surely there's a better place for some of those
dollars. Perhaps infrastructure, homeless and public health advocates might agree. Is a tax specific to
open space spending, funded to the tune of $200 million since 1997, worth it compared to another local
cause? Ms. Davies posits ""All it takes is money."" $200 million isn't enough?

Questioning push for rail service
Re: Jon Caldara's column Sunday, ""The latest rail pitch plays us for suckers"":
Caldara really put the rail idea into the light of day from a current and historical view.
I frequently go to Arizona and on our last trip we stopped for a break in Trinadad; I asked a few people
about the purposed rail service going north to Denver. The people I spoke with replied, ""None of them
ever heard of anyone asking their opinion on it.""
Those replies made me wonder.
Has there been research or survey of the citizens or local governments along the purposed rail route?
What do the people who own the rail tracks have to say about this idea?
Where do these people who keep pushing for rail service get their data for the alleged interest in this
idea? I cannot find real data anywhere and would like to review.

Observations on the leaky border
Thank you for your lengthy interview with Phil Weiser, the ""People's Lawyer"", and your viewpoint
concerning the leaky Southern border, which you blame in part 'for killing Coloradans' because of the
allegedly deadly amounts of drugs being smuggled across the Mexican border in spite of the wall.
I would like to make two observations: First. A lot of our well-meaning citizens, who have never been
close to the Mexican border, seem to think that ""The Wall"" is the answer to our so-called immigration
crisis. I have been to the wall up close on several occasions and believe that it is not impenetrable. If you
build it 20 feet high, folks desperate enough to come north will bring 21 foot ladders. If we really want to
keep everyone out, take lessons from the former East Germany or from today's Israel to get instructions
in building brutal barriers that are ""effective"".
Second. As Weiser indicates, most of the drugs don't come across the walled border anyway, but are
smuggled through border crossing points. Instead of placing the emphasis on keeping the drugs out, why
don't we address the excessive demand for drugs in-house? I mean, isn't it basically a supply and
demand issue? As long as enough addicts on this side of the border desire these illegal stimulants, the
supply line will provide them, regardless of attempts at interdiction.

Resolutions to the housing issue
It was interesting to see two situations highlighted in Sunday's Gazette. The article in the Business
section about shortage of homes for sale (and as we all know, the greatly increased cost of lumber is
making the purchase of a new home increasingly difficult and $30,000 more in cost outside of budget)
and the Opinions of our residents in the OpEd section regarding the recent decision of the City Council to
allow the construction of 400 apartment units at the Garden of the Gods area, even when many residents
of the area openly objected to the council via in person, Zoom, emails, etc.
The irony of the dichotomy between interests is something as a community to consider. We have
contradictory groups. We have the City Council trying to deal with the housing shortage (although more
overpriced apartments doesn't seem like an answer,) and neighbors whose views will be impacted, but
more importantly, their infrastructure potentially compromised in the event of a natural disaster such as
fire experienced several years ago in the Waldo Canyon fire.
The inventory of single-family homes for sale is at an all time low. Owning a home, even if you had
considered selling and moving is difficult because where will you go if you sell and there isn't something
else to buy. What a conundrum we are in.
As a community, I certainly hope we can come up with resolutions to the housing issue so we can keep
the younger population engaged in Colorado Springs, and potentially attract younger people (families) to
the area.
Colorado Springs is a wonderful place to raise your children. I know. I raised two beautiful daughters
here. We need to figure a way to work through the housing issue, particularly since Space Force is here
(at least for a few years, and hopefully more.)

How will Durango City Council candidates address the.txt,"How will Durango City Council candidates address the
environment? - Water, wildfire mitigation, recycling among top
priorities
March 19, 2021  Durango Herald, The (CO)
Author: Shannon Mullane; Durango and Pine River Valley reporter Section: Local News 1054 Words

When it comes to the environment, Durango's seven City Council candidates plan to focus on a wideranging list of issues, but one  wildfire management  rose to the top.
The candidates are running for three open City Council seats in the April 6 election. Six would be council
newcomers, and one, Melissa Youssef, is wrapping up her first term. Those who are elected will hold
four-year terms.
When asked for their top-priority action item, if elected, many of the candidates balked: All are important,
they said.
Existing environmental endeavorsThe city of Durango already has plans and goals in place to address
environmental topics, such as reducing the city's carbon footprint, addressing its water needs and
increasing efficiency when it comes to resource use.
In 2019, the City Council approved goals to reach an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2050, compared with 2016 levels. That includes an interim goal of a 30% reduction by 2030.
The city also aims to use 100% renewable electricity by 2050 and rely on renewable energy for 50% of
its needs by 2030.

How will Durango City Council candidates address the environment?
In 2020, the city started the process of implementing its sustainability plan, with early public feedback
pushing for faster action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Itheld events, like the annual pumpkin drop-off, to promote waste reduction and launched a Green
Business Durango certification program.
It also developed an electric vehicle readiness plan, in partnership with La Plata Electric Association, and
installed new charging stations to prepare for the expected widespread adoption of electric vehicles.
Candidate viewsLisa McCorry, a landscaper and former chef, declined to comment on her top
environmental priority, but said she was encouraged by the city's recent adoption of an energy
performance contract.
The energy performance contract will see the completion of energy and water efficiency improvements
alongside the installation of solar photovoltaic panels at city facilities.
""That's a recent success. We can go further with that,"" McCorry said. ""That's a big thing I'm celebrating
right now for sure.""
Olivier Bosmans, an international project manager and environmental consultant, also declined to
describe a top priority.
When it comes to the environment, Bosmans first referred to his professional experiences. He's been an
environmental health and safety consultant for 20 years, dealing with greenhouse gases, air quality,
water quality, pollution and more.
""All of those topics are important, you cannot say one needs to be done,"" Bosmans said. ""The city, within
their restrictions, has good plans and initiatives, like the electric vehicle charging station.""
Harrison Wendt, a youth camp coordinator with Durango schools, said his top priority would be to
improve the city's recycling program.
""In Durango, if we can almost reimagine our recycling program and invest in it, we can see a huge
outcome and increase in people recycling,"" Wendt said.
He also said the city should ban the use of single-use plastic bags, which has been done in other
Colorado cities.
Jessika Buell, a local business owner, focused on protecting public lands from the impacts of overtourism, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
She said the city might have to implement permit systems for crowd management in 2021 or increase
the presence of strategically placed volunteers to educate the public about best practices.
""People want to travel outside and in smaller areas because it's safer,"" Buell said. ""I feel like that could be
a huge environmental issue to watch this year.""
Wildfire and watershedSeth Furtney, Melissa Youssef and Frank Lockwood all emphasized addressing
wildfire threat to the city.
Furtney, a former engineering contracts manager, ranked it as his No. 1 priority if elected.
He said the city should use its resources to support the Wildfire Adapted Partnership, the Durango Fire
Protection District, the Rocky Mountain Restoration Initiative and the Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund.
The watershed should be a high priority area for mitigation ""because if that water supply were to become
fouled, we could disappear,"" Furtney said.
He also supported the city's energy performance contract, buthe said city funding might be better spent
simply planting trees following the city's community forest plan.
""When you're looking for bang for the buck, you could plant thousands of trees and might have a better
impact on the climate and reducing carbon emissions,"" Furtney said.
Youssef, who joined the council after a 30-year career in finance, said the city is trying to decrease its
carbon footprint, increase its renewable energy use and improve the quality of our natural resources.
""All of those are critically important, clearly,"" she said.
When asked what action she would prioritize if re-elected, Youssef wanted to see collaboration with the
Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund. The fund is trying to coordinate and finance a large-scale mitigation
effort across city borders with other land managers and private landowners.
""After the 416 Fire, we know fires don't stop at city borders. The impact to our community was
devastating,"" Youssef said. ""I'm feeling very passionate about addressing this (fire mitigation) after that.""
Water sourceLockwood, retired after 30 years as an attorney, said Durango faces a few unique
responsibilities, like the reliability of water sources, addressing wildfire threats and maintaining natural
trails. That's aside from the overarching issue of climate change, he said.
""We should do everything we can do on our part and lower our carbon footprinthere,"" Lockwood said.
If he had to prioritize one action item as a councilor, he said he would focus on water.
During the 416 Fire, the city was just days away from running out of water  even though the city has
rights to a portion of the water stored in Lake Nighthorse, a reservoir in southeastern Durango. The city
just does not have infrastructure connecting the lake to its water system.
""We've already paid millions of dollars for our portion of Lake Nighthorse, but we don't have a hookup,""
Lockwood said. ""We need to get it hooked up.""

opportunity to reach their full potential, contribute to their community, and help ensure America remains
the strongest and greatest nation in the world."" A bill opponent, Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said it
wrongly promised a path to citizenship for millions ""who illegally arrived prior to January 1, were under 19

adopt the E-Verify immigrant status check system for the agriculture industry. Lofgren said it ""will make
America stronger. It is fair to farmworkers. It is fair to farmers. And it is good for America."" A bill
opponent, Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said that by granting green cards and a path to citizenship to
up to 2.5 million illegal immigrants in the agriculture industry it ""will depress wages, not just in agriculture,
but in every field of the economy for years to come."" The vote, on March 18, was 247 yeas to 174

seat."" An opponent, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said Becerra lacked adequate experience in public health
and ""lacks the executive experience that would be useful in running a complex executive branch
department like HHS, which is involved in the nationwide vaccine rollout and now the regulatory
implementation of the recent $1.9 trillion package."" The vote, on March 18, was 50 yeas to 49

On the surface, wildfires seem simple.
There's a spark, a few small twigs flare up, and it spreads throughout a forest landscape until it runs its course or is doused by firefighters.
In the United States, we see it tens of thousands of times a year, from relatively innocuous burns deep in the wilderness -- that most people won't even hear about -- to violent blazes along the wildland-urban interface that can consume everything in their paths, leaving behind only scorched earth and melted metal.
But how do wildfires happen, and what factors determine whether a fire will stay calm or burst into an unpredictable and uncontrollable force of nature?
In reality, the causes and effects of wildland fires are complex, rippling through a wide network of trees, brush and wildlife inside a forest and broadly impacting its ecology and biology.
The flashpoint
There's an old saying that fire follows people, and the statistics back it up.
While fires caused by lightning and spontaneous combustion do occur naturally, almost all wildfires are caused by humans in one way or another.
""People don't like to hear this, but eight out of 10 wildfires are human-caused,"" said Jeff Berino, former chief at Summit Fire & EMS and fire science instructor at Colorado Mountain College. ""That includes everything from downed power lines, particles from a diesel engine landing on grass, outof-control campfires or kids with matches. People often assume arson, but people do dumb things all the time. And accidents happen.""
For an accident to turn into a wildfire, the environmental conditions have to be ripe. But to better understand how ambient conditions affect fire behavior, ithelps to break down the chemistry of combustion.
At a base level, fire needs three components to sustain itself: fuel, oxygen and heat. Instead of a single reaction taking place, there are thousands, even tens of thousands, of reactions to produce self-sustaining flames.
""When you look at a piece of wood, what you're really looking at is essentially sugar that has bonded to itself,"" said Torben Grumstrup, a research mechanical engineer at the U.S. Forest Service's Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Mont. ""And just like glucose and fructose are good fuel for us, those serve as fuel for a fire.""
As a heat source moves toward a piece of wood, the fuel eventually will hit a temperature -- about 480 to 575 degrees Fahrenheit -- when the molecules begin to break off the main body, a thermal decomposition process called pyrolysis. As a result, a stew of gas made up of broken-off submolecules reacts with the oxygen in the air, producing carbon dioxide, water, heat and light.
""When you see flames, it's not actually the solid wood burning,"" Grumstrup said. ""It's actually this gas that's produced by the process of pyrolysis that's burning.""
Once a flame is born, there are three primary variables that decide how it will act: fuel, weather and topog raphy.
Fuel for fires
How quickly a fire starts and spreads is determined by myriad environmental factors, perhaps most notably the type of fuel and the moisture level inside.
""When you have a fuel -- grass, pine needles, logs, any woody biomass -- that's full of water, when the fire burns that fuel, it not only has to heat up the fuel to get to the point where the chemistry of combustion is sustainable, it also has to heat up the water contained in the fuel and turn it from liquid into steam,"" Grumstrup said. ""And that takes a surprising amount of energy because water is a really phenomenal absorber of heat.""
In other words, the less moisture content you have in a fuel source, the easier it is for a fire to become self-sustaining and to spread.
Precipitation and the relative humidity in the air are the driving factors behind fuel moisture.
Different size fuel sources also vary considerably in how they react to precipitation and humidity, with larger fuels requiring longer times to adapt to changes in the atmosphere.
Officials also measure dead and living fuel sources, which can return moisture levels of between zero to 30% and 30% to 300%, respectively, meaning living fuels can hold up to three times their weight in water. As a result, the critical values -- when a fuel source is readily available for combustion -- differ widely in various vegetations. For example, a dead fuel source like pine needles might hit the critical mark at around 6% fuel moisture content while living sagebrush can hit critical moistures at 100%.
But the moisture and size of fuel is only part of the equation in a wildfire. Fuel loading -- the volume and density of fuel sources -- also plays a major role.
""It impacts fire behavior fundamentally,"" said Ross Wilmore, a former zone fire management officer with the White River National Forest and wildland fire specialist with the Greater Eagle Fire Protection District. ""The heavier the fuel loading, the more fuel is available to increase the fire intensity.""
As a broad generalization, lighter fuels burn and spread faster, while heavier fuels burn slower and with more intensity. The composition of fuel types, along with density, helps to predict the type of
fire.
The weather factor
Other weather factors aside from precipitation and humidity also are key in determining how a fire will behave. The biggest is wind.
Not only does wind help supply a fire with more oxygen enabling the faster combustion of fuels, it also drives flames toward one direction, pressing the fire closer to the ground and enhancing how quickly heat is being transmitted to different fuel sources on the forest floor.
""Wind is the biggest driver of wildfires,"" Berino said. ""T hink of it like blowing on a campfire. It has the same effect of giving the fire more oxygen, but it's also pushing the fire toward adjacent vegetation and starting to preheat it.""
By the time a flame reaches the new fuel source, it has absorbed a considerable amount of heat and is ready to combust.
Oxygen availability also affects how hot a flame burns and, in turn, what the fire looks like. With sufficient oxygen to burn up the entirety of a fuel source, wildfires can burn at about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit and will show a yellow flame and white smoke. Without enough oxygen to thoroughly burn fuels, wildfires likely will burn at between 1,100 and 1,300 degrees, with red and orange flames and darker smoke.
The slope effect
The final major contributing factor in determining a wildfire's behavior is the topography in which it's burning, and the most important variable in the landscape is slope.
Fire tends to burn more aggressively moving uphill. Similar to the effects of wind, steep slopes allow for the preheating of nearby vegetation.
The aspect of slopes also will impact how susceptible the area is to a wildfire, largely because of temperature and which areas are receiving direct sunlight.
This means that the time of day plays a role in when fires are most active, with fire danger typically peaking during the hottest and driest part of the day at around 2 p.m.

How_much_damage_does_climate_change__Colorado_Sun_The_CO___May_25_2021.txt,"Ho w much damage do e s climate change - Colorado Sun, The (CO ) - May 25, 2021
May 25, 2021  Colorado Sun, The (CO)  Mark Jaffe
The East Troublesome fire, Colorado's second largest ever, was sweeping across Grand County forests on Oct. 25, 2020, part of a record-breaking wildfireseason that forced evacuations, destroyed homes and took lives.
Half a world away, heavy rains were flooding the Bagerhat District in Bangladesh, in one of the worst monsoon seasons on record. And three days later, record-tying Hurricane Zeta slammed into the Gulf Coast, breaching Louisiana levees and causing storm-surge flooding in Mississippi and Alabama.
Such ""natural disasters,"" scientific studies find, are being bolstered in frequency and ferocity by the buildup of human-caused greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and now there are growing efforts -- in Washington and at the Colorado statehouse -- to put a price on those gases for the economic damage they wreak.
The Biden administration and Colorado legislators are turning to a calculation called the ""social cost of carbon"" to measure the economic harm of putting one additional ton of carbon dioxide, the prime greenhouse gas, into the air.
The dollar value of the social cost of carbon -- Colorado is using a minimum of $46 a ton -- is, however, not without controversy.
""We really can't pin down the social cost of carbon,"" said Robert Pindyck, a Massachusetts Institute of T echnology economist.
T hirteen Repubican attorneys general have sued to block the Biden administration's effort to upgrade the models used by the federal government to calculate carbon costs, arguing the figure is ""inherently speculative.""
Borrowing a phrase, and a bit of hyperbole, from James Madison's ""Federalist Papers,"" they called the exercise ""the very definition of tyranny.""
Attorneys general from 10 other Republican states have also filed a similar lawsuit, calling the social cost of carbon ""the most important number you've never heard of.""
""This is where science butts up against political reality and necessity,"" said Gernot Wagner, a New York University economist. ""The question is, is a number better than no number? No number means there are no costs of carbon, but we know there is a cost.""
The 2020 Colorado fire season tallied $226 million in firefighting costs -- there were nine fires , including the Cameron Peak fire, the largest in the state's history -- and $1 billion in insured property damage.
Hurricane Zeta, a record-matching sixth hurricane to make landfall in a season, inflicted $4.3 billion in damages across nine states, and the monsoons destroyed 1.3 million homes in Bangladesh.
The social cost of carbon is already embedded in a 2019 Colorado law regulating utilities, and there are two bills working their way through the legislature this year that would employ it to manage natural gas energy efficiency programs and cut the state's greenhouse gas emissions.
The 2019 law, Senate Bill 236, directed the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to use a social cost of carbon in evaluating all existing electric generation and in the approval of the plan by Xcel Energy, the state's largest electricity provider, for closing plants and adding new generation.
This legislative session, Senate Bill 200 would place firm caps on the state's greenhouse emissions and give the Air Quality Control Commission the ability to use the social cost of carbon in any rulemaking affecting greenhouse gas emissions. Gov. Jared Polis has said he would veto the bill because of the emission caps.
A second bill, House Bill 1238, directs the PUC to use a social cost of carbon and a social cost of methane in evaluating energy efficiency and demand management programs for utilities, like Xcel and Atmos Energy, selling natural gas to homes and businesses.
""We really needed to have a planning assumption on the cost of carbon in investing taxpayer or rate payer dollars,"" said Sen. Chris Hansen, a Denver Democrat and cosponsor of House Bill 1238.
Hansen said because there isn't a carbon market price -- some European countries do have markets where carbon credits are bought and sold -- ""this is the next best thing.""
In the first Colorado use of the social cost of carbon, Xcel Energy was required to include it in the resource plan for new and existing generation and transmission.
Under its preferred plan, Xcel proposes closing all its coal-fired power plants by the end of 2029, except the Comanche 3 unit, in Pueblo, which it wants to run until 2039. Environmental groups are pushing for Comanche 3 to be closed by 2029.
In its calculations, without factoring in the cost of carbon, closing Comanche 3 early will be $103 milion more expensive than Xcel's preferred plan. But once the cost of carbon is added, closing Comanche 3 creates a $267 million savings, the company said in its filing.
""When you include the social cost of carbon there is no economically rational basis for running coal units,"" Matt Gerhart, a Sierra Club attorney, said.
Jonathan Adelman, an Xcel vice president, said ""it is really easy to cherry pick one number out of a complex filing. The cost of carbon is a planning tool, not something customers pay.""
Closing Comanche 3 early would require an additional 1,000 megawatts of new ""dispatchable"" generation, most likely natural gas-fired turbines, and would definitely have an impact on customer bills, Adelman said.
Keeping Comanche 3 running on a limited basis ""buys us time for new technology to emerge,"" he said. ""We are trying to strike a balance.""
Seven other states -- from Maine to California -- are also using the social cost of carbon in utility sector policy and evaluation.
A serious push to cut greenhouse gases, Adelman said, will have to expand the use of the social cost of carbon beyond utilities to other economic sectors, especially transportation, now the largest source of carbon emissions in the U.S. and Colorado.
""There is an evolution here, a broader focus,"" he said, ""as we think about decarbonizing the broader economy.""
How the math works
But where does this number, this social cost of carbon come from? Is it, as NYU's Wagner says, based on the ""best available science,"" or is it ""arbitrary and capricious"" as the Republican attorneys general contend?
It was another group of state attorneys general -- Democrats this time -- thathelped create the social cost of carbon through a lawsuit that argued the administration of President George W. Bush failed to take into account carbon costs in issuing auto emission standards.
In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal Environmental Protection Agency had the authority and responsibility to regulate greenhouse gases. Bush-era federal agencies began applying various carbon cost measures in their planning and cost-benefit analyses.
President Barack Obama created the Interagency Working Group to develop a model to calculate a uniform cost of carbon and two other potent greenhouse gases -- methane and nitrous oxide -- to be used across the federal government.
The group was also charged with monitoring and improving the calculation, which initially came to a midrange figure of $42 a ton in 2007 dollars. This is the figure upon which Colorado carbon cost is based.
The T rump administration disbanded the working group and by tweaking the calculation reduced the cost of carbon to between $1 and $7.
One adjustment was to consider only domestic losses rather than global ones as had previously been done. So, yes to the East Troublesome Fire and Hurricane Zeta, and no to the Bangladeshi monsoons.
On his first day in office, President Joe Biden reestablished the working group and gave it a year to come up with an improved model for calculating the cost and a new dollar figure. In the interim the administration adjusted the Obama carbon cost for inflation to $51 a ton.
The social cost of methane, which is 30 times more effective than CO2 in trapping the Sun's heat,
was set at $1,500 a ton, and nitrous oxide, 200 to 300 times more potent, at $18,000 a ton.
""An accurate social cost is essential for agencies to accurately determine the social benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions when conducting cost-benefit analyses of regulatory and other actions,"" Biden said in an executive order.
Based on research since the Obama days and initial positions taken by the Biden administration, it appears the price of a ton of carbon will rise. This is of more than passing interest to Colorado for legislation has tied the state's cost of carbon number to the federal one.
The model that the working group must overhaul is a bit of a Rube Goldberg affair that starts with projections of future greenhouse gas emissions. Those emissions are fed into a model that forecasts the impact of those gases on climate -- sea level rise, storms, droughts, wildfires and such. Then a second calculates the economic damage from those climate events and finally a financial assessment is made of how to value those losses into a single number.
""All of the pieces of the social cost of carbon are independent until you've fitted them together to know the number,"" said Kevin Rennert, director of the social cost of carbon initiative at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Resources for the Future.
Linking all the bits together is a tricky exercise and one that is filled with assumptions and decisions the modelers must make.
MIT 's Pindyck warned that models sometimes give the impression we know more than we do and can confer a ""veneer of scientific legitimacy"" to policymaking.
Some parts of the social-cost-of-carbon train are, however, more sturdy than others.
It is clear thatheat-trapping greenhouse gases are building-up in the atmosphere, reaching 419 parts per million of carbon equivalent last month, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That is the highest it has been in 3.6 million years.
Carbon dioxide makes up 75% of the greenhouse gases, with methane accounting for 16% and nitrous oxide 6%. The remaining 2% comes from fluorinated gases, such as HFCs, commonly used as refrigerants.
Annual greenhouse gases are projected by the federal Energy Information Administration to rise about 25% through 2050 to an emission rate of just under 44 billion metric tons a year.
So for the social cost of carbon, researchers just have to add a set amount of greenhouse gases into the models that generate forecasts of climate change. These so-called Earth-system models have over the last two decades become more accurate, detailed and with a finer resolution so that they are able to indicate regional and local impacts.
Among the things they have been able to help show is that climate change was a contributing factor in more than half of the 20 million acres of Western forests that burned over a 36-year period; that warming Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures are increasing storm activity as
hurricanes become more powerful; and that warmer temperatures lead to heavier monsoon rains, with each 1 degree Centigrade increase adding 5% more rainfall.
And so, climate change likely had a hand in the East Troublesome Fire, Hurricane Zeta and the Bangladeshi floods.
But it's complicated
Calculating the damages from climate change, however, is where the exercise hits a rough patch. The models, which date from the 1990s, use very simplified relationships and generalized assumptions to get to a dollar figure.
There are, however, efforts underway to develop better damage estimates.
The Climate Impact Lab, a group of more than 30 researchers from half a dozen universities and institutes, is trying to develop empirical data.
In a study of the impact of climate change on mortality and gross domestic product as the world warms, the lab collected mortality data from 40 countries, accounting for 57% of the world's population.
The study found that there would be winners and losers. Oslo, Norway, where weather-related deaths are due to cold weather, would be a winner, while Accra, Ghana, where mortality is heatrelated, would be a loser.
The study calculated a social cost of carbon for mortality at a median of $17 a ton when a moderate amount of emissions is added to the model and $36.60 if a high level of emissions is added.
A comprehensive 2017 study of the impacts of climate change on agriculture concluded that instead of $2.70-a-ton benefit (a carbon-enriched atmosphere helps plants grow) each additional ton of CO2 creates $8.50 a ton loss, as higher temperatures reduced yields.
Just those two elements, in a moderate emission scenario, would account for more than half the $46 a ton social cost of carbon Colorado is using, and that is before adding costs for energy, labor productivity, forestry and other economic activities.
And then there are ""ecosystem services,"" such as the mountain forests and streams, which serve as a reservoir and water system for Colorado. These ecosystem services don't have a market value because they aren't bought and sold, said Maximilian Auffhammer, a University of California Berkeley economist.
""Just because there isn't a bald eagle McNugget doesn't mean there isn't a value to a bald eagle,"" Auffhammer said.
The final element is the financial assessment that tallies up all the damages over time -- as long as 100 years -- and discounts them to present dollars. The discount rate is the key element in setting
the figure: the lower the rate, the higher the cost of carbon.
The Obama administration used a 3% discount rate, reflecting going interest rates at the time and got its $42-a-ton average figure. The T rump administration used 7% and got the cost down to as low as $1 a ton.
The Biden administration has indicated that due to continued low interest rates it might use 2.5%, but to do that it will have to establish a clear method for setting the rate.
""This is a heavy lift. This is not an easy number to calculate,"" Auffhammer said. ""But in every sector we look at the damage and costs go up. The number is likely too low and not too high.""
""We are probably going to be wrong. But does that mean we should ignore the issue, that's the wrong answer,"" Auffhammer said.
Even Pindyck sees the need for a number. ""We think we can describe the range,"" he said. ""We have to pick a number somewhere in the middle of the range, that is all you can do.""
Still, Sen. Faith Winter, a Westminster Democrat and a cosponsor of Senate Bill 200, said that it was essential to have the social cost of carbon in the bill and to have the AQCC use it in their deliberations.
""The social cost of carbon is a measure of the eventual costs to my constituents,"" Winter said. ""There are real social costs from greenhouse gases.""

Ice Fire west of Silverton grows to 508 acres 15 contained  .txt,"Ice Fire west of Silverton grows to 508 acres, 15% contained - 'We're
in a much better position tonight than we were 24 hours ago'

SILVERTON  A wildfire burning in the San Juan Mountains west of Silverton slowed its spread Tuesday
after roaring to life Monday, scorching 508 acres and trapping 23 hikers on the popular high-alpine trail to
Ice Lake.
The Ice Fire broke out around 1:30 p.m. Monday about a quarter mile up the Ice Lakes trailhead and
quickly burned through a couple hundred acres of heavily forested area.
On Monday night, the San Juan National Forest Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed control of
the fire and went into full suppression mode, calling in a fleet of air and ground crews.
About 100 personnel were assigned to the fire as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Forest Service.
Two main objectives have emerged, said Forest Service spokeswoman Esther Godson: keep the fire
north of South Mineral Road (Forest Service Road 595) and west of U.S. Highway 550.
Because the burn is on steep terrain, the effort is mostly relying on air attacks, though ground crews
have conducted burnouts and are using avalanche chutes to create barriers around the fire.
Warm, dry and windy conditions have nothelped firefighting efforts. However, less wind Tuesday
allowed firefighters to gain 15% containment.
""We're in a much better position tonight than we were 24 hours ago,"" Incident Commander Brad
Pietruszka said in a statement.
A community in waitingNo evacuation orders are in place for the town of Silverton, which is about 6 miles
east of the fire and has a population of about 600, but residents have been alerted to be ready should the
fire start to threaten the town.
Ice Fire west of Silverton grows to 508 acres, 15% contained
San Juan County Sheriff Bruce Conrad said should the fire significantly spread, it could threaten the
town's water supply and affect travel on Highway 550.
An air-quality health advisory for wildfiresmoke was issued for San Juan County at least through 9 a.m.
Wednesday.
""There's a lot of potential here for this to affect our community,"" Conrad said.
The Sheriff's Office spent all summer strictly enforcing fire bans, knowing any outbreaks could turn
catastrophic given how dry the region is and how strapped emergency resources are with other fires, as
well as with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Across the West, numerous active wildfires have continued to break out and spread, especially in
Colorado and California.
""All summer we were aggressive,"" Conrad said. ""Then at the end of October to pull the big one, it just
doesn't seem right.""

Hike out or wait for help?Immediately after the Ice Fire broke out, South Mineral Road, a popular area for
camping, was evacuated and closed. A total of 23 hikers and three dogs were trapped above the fire and
required rescue by helicopter Monday.
Greg Anson of Carbondale was on a day hike to Ice Lake when he noticed a ""massive"" plume of smoke
around 1 p.m.
Anson and other hikers visiting Ice Lake grouped together to decide what to do, debating whether to try to
find a way to hike out of the area or wait for help.
""There was a little tension whether to wait or hike,"" he said. ""Some people didn't think they could make it.""
The firsthelicopter landed to rescue the hikers about 30 minutes after the smoke was noticed. It took
four flights to extricate the hikers. Anson said he was ferried to safety and landed about 3:15 p.m.
""It was crazy,"" he said. ""I've never been through anything like that.""

Loved to deathThe Ice Lakes trail is one of the most popular and heavily used in Southwest Colorado,
which starts at an elevation of 9,840 feet and climbs a couple thousand feet to two stunning, turquoise
alpine lakes: Ice Lake and Island Lake.
The alpine lakes are commonly featured on best hike lists in Colorado and shared on social media. On
any given day in the summer, hundreds of people make the trek to the lakes, leading to significant
resource damage in recent years.

For the past two years, the Forest Service, along with San Juan Mountains Association, have set up an
informational booth at the Ice Lakes trailhead in an effort to educate hikers about best practices in the
backcountry.
Public lands around Silverton escaped major wildfire outbreaks this summer, despite unprecedented
visitation, and the informational booth was taken down about mid-September. It is especially painful to
have a fire break out this late in the season, said SJMA Executive Director Brent Schoradt.
""It's exactly why we were there all summer,"" he said. ""It's so terrible. I think it underscores the need to
educate forest visitors. The rush of visitors is not going away, and we just need to keep it up.""
The impact to the Ice Lakes trail, at this point, is impossible to say, Schoradt said.
""We don't know what the damage is going to be,"" he said.
A new normal?What makes the Ice Fire so unusual is how late in the season it started, and how high in
elevation it burned.
Heidi Steltzer, a Fort Lewis College biology professor, said the high country usually has its first dusting of
snow in late October. But instead, the past few weeks have been unseasonably warm and incredibly dry.
Steltzer said this might be the new normal as a result of the effects of climate change. And as a result,
higher-elevation forests that typically didn't experience catastrophic fires may now be at risk, she said.
Indeed, the last major fire near Silverton was 141 years ago when the Lime Creek Fire south of town
burned 26,000 acres of high-elevation forests around Molas Pass.
Jonathan Thompson, a local author and journalist, said locals referred to the forests around Silverton as
""asbestos forests,"" believing a wildfire was not a risk to their community.
""Before 2002 (and the Missionary Ridge Fire), no one in Silverton really seemed to think about wildfires
up there,"" he said. ""It just wasn't an issue. There had been a few smaller fires after that (Lime Creek
Fire), but nothing catastrophic.""
Ice Fire west of Silverton grows to 508 acres, 15% contained
Weather not playing niceThe rest of this week's weather forecast is not encouraging news for slowing
down the fire's spread, said Erin Walter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Grand
Junction.
For the next few days, wind gusts could reach more than 30 mph, with highs in the upper 50s and no
chance for precipitation.
""Dry and gusty winds are nothelpful for any fire growth,"" Walter said.
But Walter said there is a chance a storm could enter the region Friday, and potentially bring moisture
over the weekend.
""There's still some uncertainty between the models on how much precipitation and how those storms will
pass,"" she said.
Fire danger has remained high throughout the summer in Southwest Colorado, and Stage 1 fire
restrictions remain in place in the San Juan National Forest, which prohibits campfires and smoking in
certain outdoor areas.
The cause of the Ice Fire remains unknown and under investigation, but the region hasn't had any
lightning storms in weeks, which leads one to believe it was likely human-caused, Conrad said.
Godson said the Forest Service's fire investigators have been on scene the past few days, but there's no
timeframe for when they'll determine a cause.
The Forest Service asks the public to not stop on the highway to take pictures or fly drones, which
forces aerial attack aircraft to ground. All public lands that border Mineral Creek are closed to the public.

October 23, 2020  Journal, The (Cortez, Dolores, Mancos, CO)  Jonathan Romeo; Herald staff writer
The Ice Fire experienced little growth and was 30% contained as of Thursday night despite high winds that swept through the region.
""There was a little bit of activity, but it was basically inside the fire lines and not a threat,"" U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andy Lyon said in an interview with The Durango Herald on Thursday night. ""Considering how much wind was on it, it was not very active at all.""
The Ice Fire broke out Monday afternoon, about a quarter mile up the popular Ice Lakes trailhead, about 6 miles west of Silverton.
As of Thursday, the fire had burned about 600 acres, but most of that new growth is from burnout operations on the fire 's boundaries in an attempt to box it in the South Mineral Creek area, said Incident Commander Brad Pietruszka.
Burnouts are a firefighting strategy where an area is intentionally burned along a containment line, so when the wildfire hits, there are no fuels to burn and it can't spread.
Firefighters reached 30% containment, mostly along the fire's southern edge at South Mineral Creek Road. Avalanche chutes and burnout operations are being used to contain the fire at its western and eastern flanks, Pietruszka said.
The Ice Fire is not expected to spread to the north because the terrain runs into rocky peaks with no vegetation. So far, the fire has petered out once reaching grasses above tree line, Lyon said.
While suppression efforts so far have been successful, high winds are again in the forecast for Friday, which have the potential of causing the Ice Fire to increase in size.
Luckily, humidity and cold temperatures at night are setting up conditions during the day that aren't resulting in uncontrollable fire spread.
""A little bit of humidity increase can make a big difference,"" Lyon said.
The good news, Lyon said, is that precipitation, most likely snow, is in the forecast for Sunday, which could stall the fire .
""It's not out, it's not over, but the closer we get to the moisture this weekend, the better we're feeling,"" he said.
Lyon said the cause of the fire remains unknown and under investigation.
No evacuation orders have been issued for the town of Silverton, but emergency management
officials are encouraging residents to be alert of the situation should the fire take a turn for the worse.
""2020 still has some challenges to present our community ,"" said San Juan County Sheriff Bruce Conrad. ""We're feeling pretty positive about where things are going.""
An air-quality health advisory for wildfiresmoke is in effect for San Juan County until 9 a.m. Friday.
Fire danger has remained high throughout the summer in Southwest Colorado, and Stage 1 fire restrictions remain in place in the San Juan National Forest , which prohibit campfires and smoking in certain outdoor areas.
The Forest Service asks the public to not stop on the highway to take pictures or fly drones, which force aerial attack aircraft to divert from an area. All public lands that border Mineral Creek are closed to the public.

The Ice Fire experienced little growth and was 25% contained as of Wednesday night, but high winds forecast for Thursday will put firefighting efforts to the test.
""T hings are looking good, but it is a wildfire,"" U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andy Lyon said during a virtual community meeting Wednesday night. ""And things can change.""
The Ice Fire broke out Monday afternoon, about a quarter mile up the popular Ice Lakes trailhead, about 6 miles west of Silverton.
As of Wednesday, the fire had burned about 580 acres, but most of that new growth is from burnout operations on the fire 's boundaries in an attempt to box it in the South Mineral Creek area, said Incident Commander Brad Pietruszka.

""2020 still has some challenges to present our community ,"" said San Juan County Sheriff Bruce Conrad. ""We're feeling pretty positive about where things are going.""
An air-quality health advisory for wildfiresmoke is in effect for San Juan County until 9 a.m. Thursday.
Fire danger has remained high throughout the summer in Southwest Colorado, and Stage 1 fire restrictions remain in place in the San Juan National Forest , which prohibit campfires and smoking in certain outdoor areas.
The Forest Service asks the public to not stop on the highway to take pictures or fly drones, which force aerial attack aircraft to divert from an area. All public lands that border Mineral Creek are closed to the public.

SILVERT ON  A wildfire burning in the San Juan Mountains west of Silverton slowed its spread Tuesday after roaring to life Monday, scorching 508 acres and trapping 23 hikers on the popular high-alpine trail to Ice Lake.
The Ice Fire broke out around 1:30 p.m. Monday about a quarter mile up the Ice Lakes trailhead and quickly burned through a couple hundred acres of heavily forested area.
On Monday night, the San Juan National Forest Type 3 Incident Management Team assumed control of the fire and went into full suppression mode, calling in a fleet of air and ground crews.
About 100 personnel were assigned to the fire as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Forest Service.
Two main objectives have emerged, said Forest Service spokeswoman Esther Godson: keep the fire north of South Mineral Road (Forest Service Road 595) and west of U.S. Highway 550.
Because the burn is on steep terrain, the effort is mostly relying on air attacks, though ground crews have conducted burnouts and are using avalanche chutes to create barriers around the fire.
Warm, dry and windy conditions have nothelped firefighting efforts. However, less wind Tuesday allowed firefighters to gain 15% containment.
""We're in a much better position tonight than we were 24 hours ago,"" Incident Commander Brad Pietruszka said in a statement.
A community in waitingNo evacuation orders are in place for the town of Silverton, which is about 6 miles east of the fire and has a population of about 600, but residents have been alerted to be ready should the fire start to threaten the town.

San Juan County Sheriff Bruce Conrad said should the fire significantly spread, it could threaten the town's water supply and affect travel on Highway 550.
An air-quality health advisory for wildfiresmoke was issued for San Juan County at least through 9 a.m. Wednesday.
""There's a lot of potential here for this to affect our community,"" Conrad said.
The Sheriff's Office spent all summer strictly enforcing fire bans, knowing any outbreaks could turn catastrophic given how dry the region is and how strapped emergency resources are with other fires, as well as with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Across the West, numerous active wildfires have continued to break out and spread, especially in Colorado and California.
""All summer we were aggressive,"" Conrad said. ""Then at the end of October to pull the big one, it just doesn't seem right.""

Hike out or wait for help?Immediately after the Ice Fire broke out, South Mineral Road, a popular area for camping, was evacuated and closed. A total of 23 hikers and three dogs were trapped above the fire and required rescue by helicopter Monday.
Greg Anson of Carbondale was on a day hike to Ice Lake when he noticed a ""massive"" plume of smoke around 1 p.m.
Anson and other hikers visiting Ice Lake grouped together to decide what to do, debating whether to try to find a way to hike out of the area or wait for help.
""There was a little tension whether to wait or hike,"" he said. ""Some people didn't think they could make it.""
The firsthelicopter landed to rescue the hikers about 30 minutes after the smoke was noticed. It took four flights to extricate the hikers. Anson said he was ferried to safety and landed about 3:15 p.m.
""It was crazy,"" he said. ""I've never been through anything like that.""

Loved to deathThe Ice Lakes trail is one of the most popular and heavily used in Southwest Colorado, which starts at an elevation of 9,840 feet and climbs a couple thousand feet to two stunning, turquoise alpine lakes: Ice Lake and Island Lake.
The alpine lakes are commonly featured on best hike lists in Colorado and shared on social media. On any given day in the summer, hundreds of people make the trek to the lakes, leading to significant resource damage in recent years.

For the past two years, the Forest Service, along with San Juan Mountains Association, have set up an informational booth at the Ice Lakes trailhead in an effort to educate hikers about best practices in the backcountry.
Public lands around Silverton escaped major wildfire outbreaks this summer, despite unprecedented visitation, and the informational booth was taken down about mid-September. It is especially painful to have a fire break out this late in the season, said SJMA Executive Director
Brent Schoradt.
""It's exactly why we were there all summer,"" he said. ""It's so terrible. I think it underscores the need to educate forest visitors. The rush of visitors is not going away, and we just need to keep it up.""
The impact to the Ice Lakes trail, at this point, is impossible to say, Schoradt said.
""We don't know what the damage is going to be,"" he said.
A new normal?What makes the Ice Fire so unusual is how late in the season it started, and how high in elevation it burned.
Heidi Steltzer, a Fort Lewis College biology professor, said the high country usually has its first dusting of snow in late October. But instead, the past few weeks have been unseasonably warm and incredibly dry.
Steltzer said this might be the new normal as a result of the effects of climate change. And as a result, higher-elevation forests that typically didn't experience catastrophic fires may now be at risk, she said.
Indeed, the last major fire near Silverton was 141 years ago when the Lime Creek Fire south of town burned 26,000 acres of high-elevation forests around Molas Pass.
Jonathan T hompson, a local author and journalist, said locals referred to the forests around Silverton as ""asbestos forests,"" believing a wildfire was not a risk to their community.
""Before 2002 (and the Missionary Ridge Fire), no one in Silverton really seemed to think about wildfires up there,"" he said. ""It just wasn't an issue. There had been a few smaller fires after that (Lime Creek Fire ), but nothing catastrophic.""

Weather not playing niceThe rest of this week's weather forecast is not encouraging news for slowing down the fire 's spread, said Erin Walter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Grand Junction.
For the next few days, wind gusts could reach more than 30 mph, with highs in the upper 50s and no chance for precipitation.
""Dry and gusty winds are nothelpful for any fire growth,"" Walter said.
But Walter said there is a chance a storm could enter the region Friday, and potentially bring moisture over the weekend.
""There's still some uncertainty between the models on how much precipitation and how those storms will pass,"" she said.
Fire danger has remained high throughout the summer in Southwest Colorado, and Stage 1 fire restrictions remain in place in the San Juan National Forest , which prohibits campfires and smoking in certain outdoor areas.
The cause of the Ice Fire remains unknown and under investigation, but the region hasn't had any lightning storms in weeks, which leads one to believe it was likely human-caused, Conrad said.
Godson said the Forest Service's fire investigators have been on scene the past few days, but there's no timeframe for when they'll determine a cause.
The Forest Service asks the public to not stop on the highway to take pictures or fly drones, which forces aerial attack aircraft to ground. All public lands that border Mineral Creek are closed to the public.

Illegal_campfires_plague_San_Juan_National_Forest__Durango_Herald_The_CO___June_4_2020.txt,"Ille gal camp fire s p lague San Juan Natio nal Fo re st - Durango He rald, The (CO ) - June 4, 2020
June 4, 2020  Durang o Herald, The (CO)  Jonathan Romeo; County & environment reporter
Illegal campfires have been a constant issue in the San Juan National Forest in recent weeks, elevating concerns about potential wildfire during a time of extreme drought.
Current restrictions ban all fires, whether in developed campground fire rings or at dispersed camping sites throughout the San Juan National Forest .
But that hasn't stopped people from building campfires.
In May, a total of 58 fires were reported to the Forest Service: 17 in the Columbine district, 16 in the Pagosa Springs district and 25 in the Dolores district.
The reports included a mix of abandoned fires, where people left the blaze burning; unattended fires, where people were in the area but not actively watching it; and active fires, where people were burning at their camps.
Of the 58 fires, 21 reports came over the Memorial Day weekend, resulting in nine citations, which carry a $330 fine each, and three warnings.
""Generally, our law enforcement will try to educate,"" said Heather Cave, a fire prevention specialist with the Forest Service. ""But it could be our law enforcement feels the best educational message to get the point across is a citation.""
The Forest Service was unable to provide data about where people who were issued citations live. But the agency said national forest lands are seeing incredible use for this time of year.
""There has been an increase in recreation use, but people are really doing a good job of calling in fires that are restricted right now,"" said Esther Godson, Forest Service spokeswoman. ""Maybe we're more hyper-alert as a community.""
Fire restrictions are stringent this year because fire danger is incredibly high, with conditions mirroring other years with catastrophic wildfires, like 2018.
""There is definitely a lot of worry, stress and awareness,"" Godson said. ""We're pretty scared of a repeat of that crazy fire year (2018).""
Snowpack in Southwest Colorado, which was below average, is already almost gone, melted off earlier than usual. And despite scattered rains the past couple of days, soil moisture has been unable to recover from an unusually dry spring.
June, typically Southwest Colorado's driest month, is when the majority of catastrophic wildfires break out. The Missionary Ridge Fire started June 9, 2002; the West Fork Complex Fire on June 5, 2013, and the 416 Fire on June 1, 2018.
That's why the Forest Service has been so adamant about curbing illegal campfires, Cave said. On top of regularly scheduled patrols, off-duty Forest Service staff members have volunteered on their days off to look for people with fires.
Also, if the public abides by fire restrictions, it allows firefighting crews to focus on naturally ignited blazes. Since May 21, a total of nine fires have been caused by lightning strikes that required action to put out. Five of those have been on the San Juan National Forest and four Southern Ute Indian T ribe lands.
The Forest Service is in full-suppression mode given the current novel coronavirus outbreak and the desire to avoid complications that would come with an all-out fire attack.
The COVID-19 outbreak demands people isolate as much as possible to reduce the spread of the virus. But a typical wildfire response requires firefighters to work in close contact under stressful conditions in the presence of hazardous smoke  all activities to be avoided in a global pandemic.
Across the region, jurisdictions have put in place their own fire restrictions.
The city of Durango has banned all open fires. La Plata County is in Stage 1 restrictions, which prohibits open burns and campfires. In the Durango Fire Protection District and Upper Pine River Fire Protection District, residents may have fires smaller than 3 feet in diameter in fire rings. And last week, San Juan County, Colorado, implemented Stage 1 fire restrictions.
A call to Bureau of Land Management spokesman Eric Coulter was not returned Thursday.
Hal Doughty, chief of Durango Fire Protection District, said most people within the agency's jurisdiction have been compliant, though there aren't many campgrounds and fires would be limited to people's backyards.
Issues with illegal fires have emerged at the homeless camp near Purple Cliffs. But Doughty said the Purple Cliffs camps create a dilemma  people living at the site often require fires for cooking or staying warm.
""We want to keep the community safe from the ravages of fire, but I'm not sure it's ethically right for someone homeless to not have a fire to cook or stay warm,"" he said. ""It's a real ethical dilemma for us on how to enforce.""
Bruce Evans, chief of Upper Pine River Fire Protection District, also said the public has been good about complying with restrictions. For his fire crews, lightning strikes from recent storms have been a more pressing issue.
""It's Mother Nature that's giving us the challenge,"" he said.

In Denver visit Interior Secretary Deb Haaland pledges feder.txt,"In Denver visit, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland pledges federal
response to drought, climate change

The federal government intends to provide immediate assistance to water users impacted by the West's
historic drought and develop longer-term strategies to respond to climate change, U.S. Secretary of the
Interior Deb Haaland pledged Thursday during a visit to Denver.
Haaland  flanked by Assistant Interior Secretary for Water and Science Tanya Trujillo, U.S. Rep. Diana
DeGette, D-Denver, and Denver Water CEO Jim Lochhead  spoke to the press after meeting with
state and local officials at the Denver Water Administration building to discuss collaborating on
addressing climate change and water-related issues in the West.
Haaland said the Bureau of Reclamation is working to identify and disperse ""immediate financial and
technical assistance for impacted irrigators and Indian tribes"" while also tackling longer-term climate
change responses, including building more resilient communities and protecting the natural environment.
""Being from New Mexico, I know how much climate change impacts our communities, from extended
fire seasons to intense drought and water shortages, and I know how important the Colorado River Basin
is to these discussions,"" Haaland said.
""Drought doesn't just impact one community,"" she added. ""It affects all of us, from farmers and ranchers
to city dwellers and Indian tribes. We all have a role to use water wisely, manage our resources with
every community in mind, work collaboratively and respect each other during this challenging time.""
More than one-third of Colorado is in severe drought conditions, DeGette said during the news
conference.
""The Colorado River, which serves 40 million people across the West, is tapped out,"" DeGette said.
""River beds have run dry, reservoirs that supply us with clean drinking water are essentially empty.""
While the Front Range is home to 80% of Colorado's population, it only accounts for about 20% of the
state's water, DeGette said.
""Most of our water in Denver comes from the Western Slope,"" DeGette said. ""That's why it's so
important to have everybody working together and have national leadership through Secretary Haaland
and the Biden administration to address the very real and looming issue of climate change We're
facing issues which we're seeing right now of fires, of droughts and more.""
Haaland is headed to Grand Junction  where she'll visit the Bureau of Land Management's new
headquarters for the first time  and Ridgway later in the week to discuss wildfire preparedness and the
state's outdoor recreation economy.

Farmers, ranchers crave stability in an increasingly volatile world
July 22, 2021  Colorado Hometown Newspapers (Boulder County, CO)
Author: Lucas High Bizwest Prairie Mountain Media Section: Business 320 Words
OpenURL Link
Predictability is critical for Colorado's farmers and ranchers, who are grappling with increasing volatility
related to climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Extreme weather is not new,"" Colorado State University professor Becca Jablonski said during
Colorado Proud's ""Growing, Evolving and Thriving Colorado Agriculture: Farmers and Ranchers""
roundtable held Wednesday. ""But it's arguably getting worse.""
Wildfires and droughts have become annual features of the summer growing season and unexpected
freezes during the spring and fall are becoming increasingly common.
""We're really concerned about climate change and variability,"" said Steve Ela, owner of ELA Family
Farms. ""We farm in small microclimates here in Colorado, and those microclimates are shrinking.""
Ela's operation lost half its peach crop during a freeze last October.
""Mother Nature is throwing everything at us,"" he said. "" If climate change continues, perennial fruit
trees won't do well with the variation.""
Adoption of low water-use practices and crops could ""help keep agriculture alive and keep farmers and
ranchers on the land,"" Colorado Commissioner of Agriculture Kate Greenberg said.
To complicate matters further, the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on supply chains, making it
more difficult for farmers and ranchers to source supplies and get their products to market.
Community-level networks ""were really critical for learning to adapt"" during the pandemic, Jablonski said.
Making quick pivots in response to unanticipated challenges requires a willingness to assume quite a bit
of risk, she said, but farmers who are barely scraping by often cannot afford to take big chances.
Using controlled environment agricultural practices or shifting to heartier crops could help mitigate some
risk, Jablonski said.
Even under the unpredictable and challenging conditions they're working in, there will always be a place
for small and independent farmers and ranchers in Colorado, said Rex Moore of Rock River Ranches.
""People are looking for a personal connection to their food supply, and I think we've lost some of that to
corporate America,"" he said.

April 20, 2021  Durang o Herald, The (CO)  Jason Blevins; The Colorado Sun
BRECKENRIDGE  Ann Baker Easley deftly navigates an icy trail that winds past a wooden troll, an ice rink and a railroad park.
""Pretty sure we built this. We worked on a lot of trails around here,"" says the chief executive officer of Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado, which in the past five years has funneled more than 7,500 volunteer hours into six trail projects around Breckenridge, not including the one she's sliding around on today.
Chances are very good that if you've hiked a trail in Colorado  any trail  you have Baker Easley to thank.
In her 40 years of service in Colorado, Baker Easley has enlisted tens of thousands of volunteers to build trails and repair forests. The CEO of Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado  or VOC  for 13 years, she also spent 11 years directing the Colorado Youth Corps Association on top of nearly two decades founding a host of civilian corps across the state and country.
She is the matriarch of Colorado volunteer stewardship, building a machine that unites well-trained trail and restoration experts and federal land managers to direct hordes of eager volunteers toward increasingly large-scale projects across the state. After a year in which more Americans than ever before found respite and refuge in the outdoors, VOC has long waiting lists of volunteers ready to help budget-strapped land managers better accommodate the crowds, protect wildlands, and restore habitats and watersheds scorched by fire.
And finally, those land managers have an influx of funding for big projects, thanks to the Great American Outdoors Act, President Biden's proposed infrastructure plan and legislation that could take a swarm of workers  not unlike the Civilian Conservation Corps that employed millions of young men on massive environmental projects during the Great Depression  and direct them toward landscape-shifting projects on public lands.
""The time is ripe to really position volunteer stewardship as a key player in the recipe of public lands management,"" said Baker Easley, who is retiring from her VOC post at the end of the April.
The recipe for public lands management has always relied on volunteers. For decades, a small group of trail builders has helped the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management weave pathways across public lands. Baker Easley has taken the trail-club mentality and built a system that trains leaders who can direct large groups of 100 or more volunteers.
When Baker Easley joined VOC, the group worked on about 18 projects a year, with a small-butloyal team that volunteered at least one weekend a year to build pathways in the woods. Now the group has partnership offices in Weld County and the San Luis Valley, and it works with the Forest Service, BLM, local conservation groups and communities on nearly 100 projects a year. Since 1984, the group has deployed more than 125,000 volunteers on more than 1,000 projects,
delivering $25 million in free labor across Colorado.
Since the 1980s, a growing network of volunteer stewardship groups has spread across the state, most captained by leaders who trained under the VOC banner.
'Matriarch' of Colorado outdoor volunteerism stepping down
""Ann has created this fount of creativity when it comes to motivating people to care about the state they live in,"" said Lloyd Athearn, director of the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative, which has designed and built 33 routes to the top of 30 Colorado peaks since its founding in 1994.
Athearn's team is still tallying results from infrared trailside counters, buthe expects 2020 traffic numbers on Colorado 14ers to be 20% to 30% above the previous high of 353,000 hiker days set in 2018.
""It's staggering how important our public lands were for people during the pandemic,"" Athearn said.
Colorado Fourteeners Initiative, one of many volunteer stewardship groups around the state that can trace their roots back to VOC, estimates Colorado's highest peaks need more than $18 million in trail maintenance, upgrades and replacement. Almost all of that labor will require volunteers directed by trained crew bosses whose skills were honed in VOC programs.
""As I've heard Ann say more than 1,000 times or so, volunteers are not free,"" Athearn said. ""You have people who are giving their time and effort, but it costs a lot to plan, ensure safety and make it all come together logistically.""
A poorly orchestrated trail-building trip can turn away a volunteer forever. So can a budgetstrapped land manager who rebuffs the offers of eager helpers. But that rejection of help happens all the time.
The VOC isn't just about building hiking trails. Hundreds of volunteers have seeded thousands of acres of fire-scorched land after the Fourmile Canyon, High Park and Waldo Canyon fires. The organization has trained dozens of volunteers on forest restoration techniques. Its crews have removed deadfall and thinned trees to bolster a forest 's resilience.
Jim Bedwell said one of the main complaints he heard from volunteers when he was with the U.S. Forest Service involved local rangers turning away offers of help.
""We need volunteers to be organized. They can't just show up with shovels and an idea,"" said Bedwell, spinning off a list of often-complicated steps and necessities required before volunteers start moving dirt on federal land, including lengthy environmental review, personal safety equipment and a trained leader who knows Forest Service rules.
Bedwell worked for the Forest Service for 38 years, serving as the agency's national director of recreation and heritage and retiring in 2017 as the Rocky Mountain Region's director of recreation, land, minerals and volunteers.
He now serves on the VOC board, helping guide the group's expanding role in the realm of volunteer stewardship.
The challenge of managing volunteers has grown as Forest Service budgets have been eviscerated by firefighting and staffing has been slashed by as much as a third in recent years.
That's throttled the agency's ability not just to restore fire-ravaged ecosystems, but to thin forests and reduce fuels that feed devastating wildfires. It's also slowed the agency's ability to keep up with aging facilities while managing growing waves of recreational users and to adjust to ever-evolving types of recreation.
""There has been a tremendous loss of agency capacity to plan ahead and organize and manage not only volunteers, but new funding in the world of recreation,"" Bedwell said. ""It's not just about fixing up what you had before. There is a need to adapt and have new and different facilities and amenities, and that takes professional skills. It takes collaboration and working with tribes and communities, where maybe they build trailheads and we build trails. All this takes time and expertise, i.e., people. And the people have been going down, down.""
'Matriarch' of Colorado outdoor volunteerism stepping down
Dwindling staff at the Forest Service and BLM may change with increased federal dollars directed into public lands thanks to stimulus spending, new infrastructure plans and last year's Great American Outdoors Act. A proposal by Colorado's U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse  a Democrat who chairs the House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands  includes creating a civilian climate corps that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs restoring forests and protecting public lands.
""Those are all great, but unless some of those funds can be used to build organizational capacity, it's going to be really hard to be efficient with that money,"" Bedwell said.
That's when Baker Easley's legacy will shine brightest, Bedwell said.
The training programs and VOC's ability to adapt and expand beyond trails to ecosystem-wide fire recovery, forest restoration and diversifying the volunteer base will serve the Forest Service and BLM well as the agencies adjust to new funding and new demands from public lands users, he said.
""Ann has always had her head up, looking at what's coming and what the needs are,"" Bedwell said. ""She always kepther eyes on the horizon and diversified what VOC does in terms of changing needs of federal agencies.""
Back on the icy trail near Breckenridge's Main Street, Baker Easley said it's time for those agencies to change with the evolving role of volunteer stewardship.
""The concept of shared stewardship really needs to be looking at partnerships and really bringing in better capacity with the public and I do feel we are at the prime moment to do that,"" she said. ""The agencies don't really have enough staff. We have a training institute and we train a lot of their
seasonal staff. So with this shift we are seeing with the Great American Outdoors Act and other funding, we have to have the agencies shifting too, where they say we are entering a new era and we need help in pushing some of this money out.""
Nathan Fey, the director of Colorado's Outdoor Recreation Industry Office, has helped guide a statewide education efforthelping newcomers to public lands recreate responsibly. The secondphase of that could be a focus on job creation in rural communities surrounded by heavilytrafficked Forest Service and BLM lands. Fey sees opportunity in expanding the training programs developed by Baker Easley for permanent jobs and even careers.
""These kinds of programs could be a great solution in offering a way for training formerly incarcerated individuals,"" Fey said, noting that inmates have been fighting wildfires for decades in the West. ""Maybe there's a way to add additional training for incarcerated individuals so the skills they've acquired can give them a career path as well as an opportunity to work outside. I can't think of a targeted population that could benefit more from time spent outdoors.""
Baker Easley's expansion of projects has opened doors for new volunteers. Urban projects  like installing shade canopies in pocket parks in Commerce City  enlisted help on summer weekday evenings. VOC has daytime volunteer projects as well. Recent projects involved converting urban flower beds into vegetable gardens that supply local food banks. A project in a community park in the San Luis Valley rewarded volunteers with $100 gift cards for the local grocery.
""We feel like increasingly our population is so different, and in exciting ways we need to reach them. We can't just do projects where everybody has to camp or where we all need special gear,"" she said. ""We are trying to build people's interest in the outdoors.""
Joe Lavorini, a graduate student at Western Colorado University, received the VOC's Grossman Scholarship last year after a decade of working with the group on fire restoration training programs and the building the Dixon Trail on Cheyenne Mountain.
Today he is the Gunnison County Stewardship Coordinator for the National Forest Foundation, helping the county better protect natural resources in heavily trafficked areas around Crested Butte.
Lavorini calls VOC ""the mothership of community stewardship in Colorado.""
""And Ann's leadership is a big reason for that. The organization's influence is felt at just about every stewardship organization in the state,"" Lavorini said. ""Our public lands, and our communities, are better off because of Ann's leadership.""

Mayor Koenig Larimer BOCC support 21st Century Conservation.txt,"Mayor Koenig, Larimer BOCC support 21st Century Conservation
Corps Act
April 22, 2021  Estes Park Trail-Gazette (CO)

On Tuesday (April 20) Mayor Wendy Koenig added her name to a letter to President Joe Biden expressing support for Congressman and Chairman of the Public Lands Subcommittee Joe Neguse's 21st Century Conservation Corps Act  which, according to the office of the congressman, will invest billions in reforestation, wildfire resiliency and watershed mitigation efforts. ""This past year our community was surrounded by wildfires,"" said Mayor Koenig. ""The design and implementation of the wildfire resiliency project has the potential benefit of increasing wildfiresafety for our community.""
The letter, which was also signed by Larimer County Commissioners John Kefalas and Jody ShadduckMcNally, as well as a group of 26 County Commissioners and Mayors from across the state, asked for continued partnership from the White House in ensuring the bill becomes law. County Commissioner Kristen Stephens' name is not on the letter but that is not because she does not stand by the cause.
""I was not aware of the letter, but I certainly support this legislation. I am sorry to have missed signing this letter,"" said Stephens. ""This program can put underemployed and unemployed residents to work on restoring public lands and water resources which is needed in our county. In addition these Corps will address climate change and resiliency which is a top priority for this Board of County Commissioners."" It seems the desire to tackle this issue extends across the isle as 21 Colorado conservation groups shared a similar support letter highlighting provisions in the bill that will benefit Colorado's lands, tackle western wildfires and address the climate crisis.
A few weeks ago, President Biden cited Congressman Neguse's civilian climate corps proposal, including a $10 billion fund to create the corps, in his American Jobs Plan. ""I'm grateful to the many local and community leaders for their support of our Civilian Climate Corps legislation, which would make major investments in reforestation, wildfire resiliency, watershed mitigation, climate adaptation and more,"" said Neguse.
The 21st Century Civilian Climate Corps plan would take a page out of FDR's New Deal program to recreate the corps of the 1930s, which built Red Rocks, roads, trails and campgrounds in Rocky Mountain National Park and supported other projects throughout Colorado.
""Neguse's proposed 21st Century Civilian Climate Corp would reimagine this program, and put hundreds of thousands of Americans back to work in the wake of the COVID-19 economic crisis,"" a release from the Congressman said. ""The plan additionally would support Colorado's outdoor recreation industry and address outdoor access by investing in the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Program and Every Kid Outdoors Program. Given record-breaking wildfires across Colorado in 2020  historic investments to address future wildfires are crucial.""
The following quotes were curated by the Office of Congressman Joe Neguse from Colorado public officials across the state: ""After witnessing the largest wildfire in Colorado history this fall, Larimer County knows firsthand the need for investments in wildfiresuppression, adaptation and recovery,"" said Loveland Mayor Jacki Marsh. ""Congressman Neguse's 21st Century Civilian Climate Corps proposal not only provides historic investments to tackle western wildfires and help our communities, but it would also put a new generation to work to assist with the projects. With this proposal we have a unique opportunity to not only repair our public health and economy, but to also restore our environment and protect our watersheds."" ""For Larimer County and Colorado, the need to address wildfires, invest in foresthealth and protect our watersheds is clear,"" said Larimer County Commissioner John Kefalas. ""Following this year's historic Cameron Peak wildfire, this proposal provides the resources we need to invest in wildfiresuppression, mitigation, resiliency and recovery. This bill will go a long way to support our communities and protect our environment.""
""Wildfire Resiliency Support is critical for Breckenridge's sustainable future,"" said Breckenridge Mayor Eric Mamula. ""Living in the forest and urban interface, Breckenridge is in a constant state of balancing foresthealth, wildfire mitigation, and infrastructure protection. A 21st Century Civilian Climate Corps would ensure that we can continue to protect both our community and our public lands, while also ensuring the economic viability of our town, state, and country for many years to come.""
""In Colorado, we understand the pressing need for increased resources to manage our public lands, as well as the urgency of addressing record-breaking wildfires like those we saw in Colorado and across the west this past year,"" said Gunnison County Commissioner Jonathan Houck. ""The 21st Century Conservation Corps Act, as proposed by Congressman Neguse addresses both needs, and will put Americans and Coloradans struggling from the COVID-19 crisis back to work to begin these important projects. The proposal provides historic investments that will support Colorado across the board, by investing in our economy, our outdoor recreation industry, our lands and our forests.""
""The President's $10 billion proposal for a 21st Century Climate Corps recognizes the significant role public lands and the outdoor industry play in our nation's economy and the health of our communities,"" said Jim Ramey, Colorado State Director for The Wilderness Society. ""Fortunately, Rep. Neguse has provided the legislative playbook to utilize that $10 billion to spur the economic recovery, put people to work stewarding our local parks and national treasures, and support equitable access to quality close-tohome parks for communities most in need. We urge Congress to pass the 21st Century Climate Corps as part of the American Jobs Plan.""
""Climate change is already having devastating impacts on our communities and natural landscapes  threatening our economy and way of life. The 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps Act invests resources into locally driven projects with justice and equity in mind. It would help Colorado build back better, all while moving us closer to the goal of protecting and restoring 30 percent of our lands and water by 2030,"" said Jessica Goad, Deputy Director, Conservation Colorado. ""We look forward to working with Representative Neguse and the rest of the Colorado delegation to advance this generational proposal to create jobs, tackle climate change, and improve the resilience of public lands and water.""

Microgrid feasibility study underway to connect Aspen airpor.txt,"Microgrid feasibility study underway to connect Aspen airport,
RFTA, public works

Pitkin County, Holy Cross Energy and the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority are studying the feasibility of developing a microgrid to connect a cluster of public facilities near the airport so that they could be powered by renewable energy, autonomous from the larger electric grid and protected from outages if service to the rest of the area goes down.
A $200,000 grant from the state of Colorado Department of Local Affairs is supporting the feasibility study. The state awarded the grant in fall 2019, and it was initially supposed to have been spent by the end of 2020, but due to COVID has been extended until the end of 2021, according to Pitkin County officials.
Work is underway to study baseline existing conditions and technological concepts in service of establishing a microgrid connecting the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, the county's public works facility and RFTA's bus barn, all of which are near each other straddling Highway 82 about 3.5 miles from Aspen's core Holy Cross infrastructure and the utility's Aspen office, which is in the neighborhood, also are part of the study. Once the feasibility study is complete, officials said they will seek additional grant funding from DOLA, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for implementation.
Microgrids are self-contained systems that allow users to operate as an island disconnected from the larger grid. Each system is unique but they tend to rely on on-site power generation, energy storage capability and efficiency. The county-RFTA-Holy Cross concept also seeks to capture the excess heat generated by operations at the facilities, harnessing and sharing it with other buildings.
The idea was influenced by the summer 2018 Lake Christine Fire that burned nearly 12,600 acres near Basalt and threatened the main electricity transmission lines serving the upper valley. At the same time, the county's plans to build a new airport terminal and airfield were moving forward with energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy generation in mind.
Last week's natural gas outage, cutting off heat to 3,500 homes and businesses in Aspen, served as another reminder for how a lack of resiliency can leave a community exposed to disruptions in basic services. The saving grace for many who went three nights without natural gas-powered heat was the distribution of thousands of electric space heaters.
The sites being studied around the airport lend themselves to the microgrid concept thanks to their proximity and the vital public functions they serve: landing planes, keeping the buses running and maintaining snowplows. Holy Cross transfer stations in the vicinity also are well-sited and are needed for a microgrid to safely function.
Microgrids are becoming increasingly common. Pittsburgh International Airport is establishing one powered by solar and natural gas harvested from shale underneath the facility and burned by on-site generators. The solar-powered microgrid operated by the Blue Lake Rancheria tribe in Humboldt County, California, kept electricity flowing at a hotel and gas station to support life-saving services when wildfires forced the rest of the grid to go down in fall 2019. The airport-county-RFTA-Holy Cross project, however, is unique.
""This is kind of breaking ground to be linking this many public facilities that provide such crucial services,"" said Zachary Hendrix, the long range planning and climate action plan administrator in the county's community development department work to date has involved studying existing conditions at each facility that would be connected, and examining where efficiency gains can be made. ""We call it an energy box, so if you put all the facilities inside an imaginary box, it's the energy would come from that,"" Hendrix said.
RFTA has been going down that road at its bus barn for many years and the facility, which now includes infrastructure to charge eight electric buses, utilizes a ground-source heat pump and other energy-saving technology.
The county's public works building includes a 105-kilowatt solar-power array but could benefit from upgrades to its lighting system, Hendrix said. Among the largest energy consumers in the area is the snowmelt system at the pedestrian underpass connecting the airport to the Airport Business Center under Highway 82. Each site is being studied for how it can update its systems to save more energy. ""The work so far has identified significant energy conservation potential at the existing sites studied,"" Holy Cross CEO Bryan Hannegan wrote in an email.
The second phase of the feasibility study will investigate what technology would be needed and where among the sites is best suited for the component parts. More developing solar capacity and locating shipping-container-sized lithium ion batteries to bank the energy generated by solar will be key. The heat transfer concept is rare in North America but more common in Europe. The idea is to capture the excess heat generated by buses warming inside RFTA's bus barn and in the boiler rooms at the facilities. This would require new infrastructure, such as underground piping connecting the facilities, and Highway 82 could be an impediment to that system, officials acknowledge. While existing infrastructure will help support electricity sharing between the sites, the partners will lean on Holy Cross to explore the engineering details in phase two of the feasibility study, Hendrix said. County officials hope to wrap up the feasibility study in June. It's unclear when funds would be available for an implementation grant, but the parties want to be ready.
RFTA assistant planner Jason White, who has been working on the feasibility study, said the agencies would be ""well positioned"" for a future implementation grant because they've already shown a ""high level of integration"" and DOLA loves seeing local entities working together.
Even if a fully independent microgrid for the sites takes longer to come together, other benefits can be more immediate, White said. Gains can be made in real-time operational sustainability and learning how the buildings can work together to share and use energy more efficiently.
Scalability and replicability are among the grant criteria, Hendrix said. Part of the ""joy of the microgrid,"" he said, is that once the core is in place, it's designed to be expanded. With a Colorado Mountain College campus, Aspen Fire Protection District station and hundreds of residents between the ABC and North 40 neighborhoods nearby, the hope is that everyone could benefit. The partners also hope the project can help inform efforts to connect other facilities throughout the community to microgrids. ""How do we set up subsets, so that we are not all reliant on a main trunk line?"" asked Cindy Houben, the county's community development director, referring to how utilities are delivered.
It's all part and parcel of a larger sustainability and resiliency push, which includes land-use code revisions that require new buildings in Pitkin County to be wired to accommodate on-site solar. In addition, any building with more than 10 kilowatts of solar now must have on-site storage. A significant number of these smaller-scale batteries have come online throughout the county, Hendrix said. Other recent regulatory changes have tightened the pace of growth allowed in the county and require new buildings to be more energy efficient.
""We are doing the on-the-ground, ready-set-go work for renewables, and Holy Cross is looking at how do we structure it from the energy transport lines so that we can not only have the resiliency of backup, but also looking at the overall system,"" Houben said. There is no one lever to pull or silver bullet to address climate change and its impacts, Hendrix said, but the combined effort across multiple sectors can make a difference. ""Hopefully when we pull on all these levers together, we can create a substantial impact on our climate change and greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said.

February 27, 2021  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Marianne Goodland
An occasional series of conversations with experts on the science and policies regarding fires.
The conversation about foresthealth, climate change and last year's wildfireseason moved to the money side this week, with four bills dealing with mitigation and fire suppression on the ag enda.
Monday, the House Agriculture, Livestock and Water Committee signed off on House Bill 1008, which would allow local communities to set up their own special districts to finance local mitigation projects.
It's worth noting that the state's wish list for mitigation funding is in the ballpark of $750 million, just for the most urgent areas. It would take $2.4 billion to fund all mitigation projects in unhealthy forests, according to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
State officials have said mitigation alone won't solve the problem, but neither will fire suppression. It's a balancing act, they've told Colorado Politics.
Money is cobbled together in fits and starts: some coming from the federal government, some from the state. The point of HB 1008 would be to allow local communities to assess themselves a special property tax to fund mitigation projects in their areas.
During Monday's hearing, bill sponsor Rep. Marc Catlin, R-Montrose, said that a little mitigation work might have saved watersheds damaged in the 2020 blazes. The idea of special district funding is good government, he added. That was echoed by Rep. Perry Will, R-New Castle, in whose district the Pine Gulch fire burned for two months last year. ""We wouldn't have been in that situation if we'd done this bill last year,"" he said.
The creation of a special district is an opt-in, meaning it's up to the local communities to approve them.
The idea comes out of the Southwest Colorado Impact Fund, whose leadership includes former Sen. Ellen Roberts, R-Durango. Attorney Bob Cole of Collins, Cockrel & Cole, representing SWiF, said the group has identified three areas where legislation would help:
Creating a financing authority, the special district;Allowing the special district to finance foresthealth projects through a special assessment; andGranting the local governments the legal authority to do those foresthealth projects, some of which could be on private land.
""We're facing a foresthealth crisis,"" said State Forester Mike Lester of the Colorado State Forest Service at Colorado State University. He told the committee that half the population of Colorado now lives in what's known as the ""wildland-urban interface,"" areas of the state adjacent to forests and where forest mitigation has become a necessity. Forests face challenges of drought and climate change, with 50% affected by wildfires or disease within the last 20 years, he explained.
The bill won a 11-0 vote from the committee and now heads to the House Finance Committee. Will noted at the hearing's conclusion that $1 in mitigation saves between $3 and $6 in firefighting costs.
In related news, the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday passed a slew of supplemental bills designed to realign state agency budgets for 2020-21, including three bills tied to mitigation and firefighting costs. All the supplementals passed the committee and are headed to the full Senate.
Among them: $13 million, divided three ways, for mitigation projects, wildfire preparedness and to fund watershed restoration within the DNR.
Senate Bill 54 puts $6 million into the Forest Restoration and Wildfire Risk Mitigation Grant Program Cash Fund, for grants to reduce hazardous fuels, such as dead trees, to reduce the potential risk for wildlife damage to property, infrastructure or water supplies.
The wildfire preparedness fund got $3 million, to be matched with federal dollars, to assist local governments with strategic planning to prevent wildfires.
An additional $4 million would go to the Colorado Water Conservation Board within DNR to work on damage to watersheds from the 2020 wildfires, most notably the East Troublesome Fire in Grand County. Sen. Bob Rankin, R-Carbondale, told the committee that federal funds to help pay for other watershed restoration projects are also in the works. He had a $10 million amendment at the ready for those other projects, but said he would hold it until they know what they're getting from the federal government.
But the relatively small amounts in the face of $750 million in mitigation needs troubled at least one lawmaker.
Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, R-Sterling, raised concerns about whether there's a comprehensive plan for dealing with the watershed projects.
""We will have water quality issues"" when the snowmelt starts, more so for the communities impacted by the fires, he warned. ""I want to make sure we have a plan on how to deal with water quality issues"" from those fires.
""Four million dollars is not near enough, and I'm not sure an additional $10 million is near enough,"" Sonnenberg said. ""As we balance firefighting against mitigation, $15 million won't get the water quality we need from all the damage we have.""
The committee also greenlighted Senate Bill 113 to allow the Division of Fire Safety and Prevention within the Department of Public Safety to spend $30.8 million on the purchase of a Firehawk helicopter and to lease a Type 1 chopper. It will take United Rotorcraft of Englewood a year to retrofit a Blackhawk helicopter into the Firehawk, which is why the division wants to lease a Type 1 chopper to have ready for the 2021 wildfireseason.
FIRE LINES: Colorado public safety officials hope to add top-of-the-line helicopter to aid in firefighting efforts
The Type 1 chopper can carry at least 700 gallons of water in its buckets, but because it uses buckets it can't fly over roads without closing those roads first, according to division director Mike Morgan. The Firehawk, on the other hand, can carry 1,000 gallons and does so with an enclosed container, making it more practical for urban fires, such as the Cherry Creek State Park and Bear Creek Lake Park fires earlier this month.
Sen. Steve Fenberg, D-Boulder, one of the bill's sponsors, told the committee that while the costs may seem exorbitant, this helicopter might not have been necessary a decade ago.
""We're now facing longer fire seasons ... and multiple massive fires at the same time in different parts of the state,"" Fenberg said.
He said he doesn't think the helicopters alone will fix the problem, and that the state needs to put just as much, if not more, on forest mitigation to ensure fires don't turn into massive ones. ""It's a smart investment that is unfortunately necessary,"" he said.
The third bill, Senate Bill 49, would direct $1.5 million toward the Colorado Firefighting Air Corps Fund and $7.3 million, both in general fund dollars, for aviation resources within the division.

Local resources are on the ground, helping federal partners battle the Pine Gulch Fire burning about 18 miles from Grand Junction.
""We're what's considered a government cooperator with the federal government when it comes to fire response,"" Montrose Fire Protection District Chief T ad Rowan said Monday.
""It allows us to be available at the request of our federal partners to send resources and personnel to assist on these larger-scale wildland fires, when needed.""
The MFPD has a three-person crew and an engine on the Pine Gulch Fire. The current crew was recently rotated to replace the crew that had been on the fire since Aug. 6. Most assignments through the cooperator agreement are for 14 days, which can be extended and in that event, crews are swapped out.
The crews are assigned to a specific division and specific tasks; like all crews on the fire, they report to main incident command.
The Pine Gulch Fire is one of several burning in the state, amid hot and dry conditions. The lightning-sparked blaze was spotted July 31. As of Monday afternoon, it had burned nearly 134,000 acres in Mesa and Garfield counties, with 44% containment achieved on its perimeter.
The heat and bone-dry conditions are expected to persist, even as some afternoon thunderstorms move into the fire area later this week -- those forecasted showers won't be enough to meaningfully change the moisture content in fuels, said Dave Boyd, a public information officer on the Pine Gulch Fire .
""That's what's contributing to the fire behavior so much,"" Boyd said.
The thunderstorms can also bring erratic, gusting winds, as well as lightning, which are concerns if rainfall is minimal, according to information from the incident overview.
With the Grizzly Creek Fire burning along I-70 near Glenwood, air quality throughout the area, including Montrose, has been severely affected by the smoke. The Grizzly Creek Fire additionally required closures of I-70, leading to traffic being rerouted through locations including Montrose.
On Monday, when the Grizzly Creek Fire stood at about 33 percent containment, a partial reopening of I-70 between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum was announced.
The Colorado Department of Transportation put motorists on notice that intermittent closures would be in place for required repairs, or if safety closures are required. Motorists need to adhere to reduced speeds, not stop in Glenwood Canyon, and pay attention to signs, including those for a head-to-head detour between Hanging Lake T unnel and No Name T unnel.
In Garfield County, earlier evacuation orders were adjusted to pre-evacuation orders for High Aspen, Spring Valley Ranch, Homestead Ranch, Colter Meadows and the Lookout Mountain area.
Roads in the fire area remained closed to all but residents and fire traffic.
To be a cooperator with government agencies that fight fires on public lands (U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management), the Montrose Fire Protection District has to meet National Wildfire Coordinating Group qualifications for equipment and training. The MFPD is reimbursed for equipment use and personnel.
The fire district earlier this year assisted the Forest Service on the Steel Canyon Fire that burned on the Uncompahgre Plateau, although that fire was nowhere near the magnitude of the Pine Gulch Fire .
This spring, the MFPD backed off pledging its resources under cooperator agreements, because it needed to be certain of having sufficient emergency medical services resources during the initial COVID-19 response.
""At the time, we didn't think it was appropriate to be sending resources out, until we got a handle on what the need was in the community,"" Rowan said.
As call volume related to the virus tapered off, though, the district was able to make an engine available.
""We've participated in wildland fire cooperation since the mid-2000s and worked this program pretty consistently throughout the years,"" Rowan said.
Cooperator agreements are common throughout western Colorado and regional crews bring local-level knowledge that is important to gaining control of fires, particularly one the size of Pine Gulch.
""That way, we can respond quickly when fires start. That's one big advantage,"" Boyd said.
""The closest resources can respond. Thathelps us respond more quickly and keep the fires from growing a lot of the time. Sometimes, you get something like Pine Gulch and with the way conditions are, it just takes hold.""
Working with local fire districts provides additional resources for critical work such as structure protection, as well as local knowledge, he said.
Rowan also said cooperator groups are important.
""It's a good, efficient way for local firefighters to, No. 1, assist regionally and gain valuable experience and training we can bring back to our own districts and citizens,"" he said.
""I think it's a good, efficient way for our federal partners to utilize resources. They don't have to
maintain large amounts of staffing in periods when there is not fire activity. They can draw on local governmental entities and fire districts that already have that equipment, staff and ability to fit seamless into (the firefighting structure).""

The Arapaho National Forest is making changes to the East Troublesome Fire area closure. Burned area emergency response teams have completed surveys of the fire damage and identified immediate stabilization needs, officials said Friday. Meanwhile, mitigation efforts have been completed along many roads and trails, allowing portions of the burned area to reopen.
Many forest roads and hiking trails east of Colorado Highway 125 will reopen, including the Idleglen Trailhead, Stillwater Pass Road (FSR 123), Kawuneeche Road (FSR 120), North Supply Trailhead, Supply Creek Trailhead, Trail Creek Road (FSR 116.1), Gravel Mountain Spur (FSR 815.2), Illinois Pass Trailhead, Lost Lake Trailhead, Willow Creek Pass Trailhead.
North Supply Road (FSR 120.4) and South Supply Road (FSR 119.1) have also reopened, through no dispersed camping is permitted. Dispersed camping will be allowed within 300 feet of most open roads, however there are some open roads that will be closed to dispersed camping due to the risk of flooding, landslides and debris flow.
Bull Mountain dispersed camping area remains closed to all uses to accommodate crews who are helping the recovery effort. Additionally, dispersed camping will be prohibited in the Supply Creek Area and along the Highway 125 corridor.
The western portion of the East Troublesome burned area, which is managed by the Routt National Forest, has also been partially reopened through an adjusted forest order. The Arapaho National Forest also announced at the end of June the reopening of much of the Williams Fork burn scar.
""I want to thank the Grand County community and visitors for your patience and understanding as we surveyed the damage and completed important mitigation and stabilization work in these burned areas,"" Forest Supervisor Monte Williams said. ""While we are opening some key roads and trails, there are still some critical closures in place. I'm asking everyone to honor these for their own safety and for the protection of our roads, trails and watersheds.""
While many mitigation efforts have been completed along the roads and trails that are reopening, the public is warned that standing dead and burned trees are very unstable and can fall without warning at any time.
Visitors are at greater risk when traveling at high speeds, particularly in open-sided vehicles and when camping in burned forested areas. Burned areas also contain many unseen hazards, such as burned stump holes which present a danger to those walking off trail.
Areas that remain closed may be prone to flooding, landslides and rock and tree fall. Many of the roads and trails that remain closed were identified for further mitigation and stabilization prior to reopening, officials said. In addition, many of the closed motorized routes have severely damaged infrastructure such as bridges.

November 14, 2020  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Evan Wylog e
Over the past two decades, fire seasons in Colorado have consistently grown larger and more destructive. The three largest wildfires in tracked history ignited within 10 weeks of one another this year, putting the year's total wildfire-burned acreage above the past six years combined.
It's a trend caused by several factors, experts and researchers say, and it's likely to continue.
Colorado has been lucky not to have seen the unusually large fires that characterized this year, said Camille Stevens-Rumann, a Colorado State University professor whose research focuses on fire ecolog y.
""If you think about other areas like California, or even other Rocky Mountain states, like Montana or Idaho,"" she said, ""they've had huge fires. We've not seen those. We had Hayman in 2002, then bad years in 2010 and 2011, but we haven't had to face this reality until this year.""
Hotter, drier seasons, along with some misguided forest management practices, are to blame, she and other experts agree.
Fires in Colorado are a natural event, they stressed. The lodgepole pine is cited as an example of how the ecology has evolved to coexist with regular fires. The tree's pine cone opens and releases the seeds when it raises to a certain temperature. And the natural cycle is for the adult lodgepole pines to be burned, which clears the area for the seedlings dropped after fires.
""The natural fire regime, for that system, is a stand replacement fire that kills off all the adults, about every 100-150 years or so,"" said Matthew Hurteau, a University of New Mexico professor who specializes in the effect of climate on forests.
What sets this year apart, he said, is the fires' fast spread. Only a handful of fires have grown larger than 100,000 acres in the past 20 years. The East Troublesome fire grew by 100,000 acres in a single day.
""That's unusual,"" Hurteau said, but the reason is because of higher temperatures and less precipitation.
""We had a decent snowpack this year, but it melted really quickly. The way the snowmelt is happening, and the failure for monsoons or convective storms to materialize in the summer, affects the condition for the way fires burn.""
Higher temperatures -- average global temperatures have risen about 1 degree Celsius since the middle of the 20th century -- mean the mountain snowpack doesn't last as long, Hurteau said. The same higher temperatures that shorten the winter then, in the summer, sap moisture from the ecosystem, priming Colorado's forest vegetation for a fire.
Two key metrics quantify for researchers how much the higher temperatures cause the more rapid drying of the environment.
""Vapor pressure deficit and climatic water deficit: How much moisture does the atmosphere want to pull out of the soil, versus how much there is,"" Stevens-Rumann said. ""As temperatures increase, there's more demand in those two metrics.""
The natural process plays out every summer, but with snowpack disappearing earlier in the year and not arriving until later, it happens more intensely and for a longer duration.
""It's been exceptionally warm and dry,"" Hurteau said. ""That conditions the fuel, particularly the dead fuel, to ignite and to support that kind of rate of spread.""
Bark beetle is another factor that stokes Colorado's wildfires. If a patch of trees becomes infested, after time, the trees die, leaving dead, drying timber that's primed to ignite because of the drying pattern, the experts said. And while pine needles, twigs, loose foliage or leaves on the forest floor can burn quickly without burning larger trees, standing dead trees burn hotter for longer, further contributing to more intense fires.
""Satellite data showing temperature signatures and how long areas burned show that they stayed hot, longer than is typical,"" Hurteau said, ""Which would suggest that more of that standing dead fuel is burning.""
Bark beetle is part of the natural ecosystem, but their spread to more trees has been made possible by the same problematic higher temperatures.
""It's basically when trees get water stressed, they can't kill the beetles when they attack,"" Hurteau said. ""Then the beetle populations grow and you get an outbreak.""
Forest management practices have contributed to the problem as well. The doctrine of extinguishing forest fires as quickly as possible, without regard to the natural cycle of burning and regeneration for forests, has led to more fire-prone wildland.
""A century of fire suppression, for example in the lower edge of the Front Range, like those areas right around Colorado Springs, has led to much higher forest density and continuous fuels,"" Stevens-Rumann of CSU said.
Peter Brown, the director of Rocky Mountain T ree-Ring Research, a nonprofit group focused on forest history, ecology restoration and management, said he's studied large fires dating back hundreds of years, some that burned significant portions of the western range.
""These are not unprecedented. Fire is inevitable."" he said. ""Except in our recent decades they're happening more. The question is what kind of fires are going to happen given the circumstances?""
He said there are now efforts to bring a better approach to forest management, which lets some of the fuel burn, to better match the natural cycle.
""People like to put just one explanation on this, like saying it's fire management, or saying it's climate change. Obviously, it's not one or the other. It's both.""
The overall prognosis, the experts agree, is more intense fire seasons to come.
""Will we have worse fire seasons? Absolutely,"" Hurteau said. ""I don't know anybody who studies this who disagrees.""

November 2, 2020  Colorado Sun, The (CO)  Jesse Paul
More than 300 homes were destroyed by the East Troublesome fire last month when it made an epic run across Grand County and became the second largest wildfire in Colorado's recorded history.
The news was shared Sunday evening by Grand County Brett Schroetlin, who added that an additional 100 to 200 secondary structures -- including barns and garages -- were also destroyed by the blaze.
""I will never forget watching a family return to their house for that first time,"" Schroeltin said in a Facebook post, ""parents trying to find anything they can to move forward, children trying to find that favorite toy, and each grieving in their own way. There was no words that I could say that made this any better for those families. But what I can say is that with each new day, we are continuing to move forward as a community.""
The fire has burned nearly 200,000 acres and killed two people, Lyle and Marilyn Hileman, who refused to evacuate on Oct. 21 as the blaze made its from run Kremmling into Rocky Mountain National Park. The couple was found in their longtime home near Grand Lake.
A winter storm last week helped stop the fire's advance. It is now 37% contained.
""The snow has really parked the fire,"" Dan Quinones, an incident commander trainee working on the fire, said Friday.
The destruction toll makes the East Troublesome fire one of the worst in Colorado history in terms of homes destroyed.
The 2013 Black Forest fire northeast of Colorado Springs remains the most destructive, burning 489 homes. The Waldo Canyon fire in Colorado Springs in 2012 destroyed 347 homes.
The Cameron Peak fire west of Fort Collins, which is still burning and is the largest recorded fire in Colorado history, has destroyed 222 homes or cabins. That fire is burning near scar of the High Park fire, which in 2012 destroyed 259 homes or cabins.
Vicky Winterscheidt is among those who lost a home in the East Troublesome fire. Her family had a cabin on County Road 4955 near Grand Lake for 10 years. It was a second home, though she and her husband were there when the fire came through last week.
Winterscheidt estimates that 25 of the 30 homes in her neighborhood were destroyed. ""Almost to a person, every person said they are planning to rebuild,"" she said, relaying information from an email chain.
Her family, too, is planning to build a new home.

New survey launches to assess impacts of climate change on.txt,"New survey launches to assess impacts of climate change on
tourism
December 24, 2020  Steamboat Pilot & Today (CO)

STEAMBOAT SPRINGS  As the impacts of climate change continue to grow stronger and more apparent, the Steamboat Springs Chamber and Steamboat Springs City Council are starting now to prepare for effects the Yampa Valley could see as a result of warming temperatures. City Council and Chamber decided years ago to take more sustainable action through the Sustainability Tools for Assessing & Rating Communities, a program created for local municipalities to transition to cleaner energy.
""We as humans are impacting the climate,"" said Gary Suiter, Steamboat city manager. ""We need to continue to adapt and prepare for what the future might hold.""
As part of the city's initiatives, the Chamber has sent a survey to all Steamboat businesses with connections to tourism  restaurants, retail, outdoor rental equipment and any other businesses attracting visitors.
The survey, designed by Summit Economics, will conclude at the end of January and asks businesses what, if anything, they are currently doing to mitigate future impacts of climate change, particularly as it relates to precipitation and potentially shortening Steamboat's ski season, as other ski areas around the country have already seen.
""Summit (Economics) has been engaging communities across the West and seeing what are some of the best practices,"" said John Bristol, Chamber director of economic development. ""We're looking at which sectors could potentially be impacted by climate change.""
Bristol said both winter and summer sports could be affected by warmer temperatures, but winter sports are the main focus, as less snow and later winters are two of the more immediate effects. ""The ski industry is the clearest example of adaptation strategies,"" he said. ""There are mountains that invest a lot in snowmaking to try and smoothe out later starts in the fall and keep them open longer in the spring.""
Suiter, who has worked in various communities across Colorado, said ski mountains in the southern parts of the state are already seeing less snow and later winters, and Steamboat will likely catch up soon.
""Some ski areas are already being impacted in terms of seasons going forward,"" he said. ""We need to be resilient and rebound from any impacts; whether they are human caused or not, we need to be prepared for the future.""
Bristol said the Chamber is also looking at increasing wildfires and how they can impact summer tourism.
""That certainly impacts perceptions and the summer time,"" he said. ""We're trying to understand what adaptation strategies our local businesses are thinking about or should be thinking about."" Suiter added early mitigation efforts are important in a community like Steamboat, where much of the city's livelihood revolves around tourism from outdoor activities.
""There are coastal communities that already have plans for rising sea levels,"" he said, ""It is happening."" Both Suiter and Bristol agreed the solutions are complex, but staff are working with businesses to brainstorm alternative outdoor sporting ideas for when traditional winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, may not be as accessible.
""We're looking at which sectors could potentially be impacted by climate change, and so as we see the changes in the climate, how that impacts precipitation specifically,"" Bristol said. While Suiter said climate will likely have large impacts on Steamboat's future, he believes the city and country will adapt.
""The Steamboat way is to always figure it out,"" he said.

Newmans retirement plans include skiing rosesmelling.txt,"Newman's retirement plans include skiing, rose-smelling
January 17, 2021  Aspen Times, The (CO)
Author: Jason Auslander jauslander@aspentimes.com Section: Local 933 Words

George Newman's 12-year tenure as a Pitkin County commissioner started and ended in crisis. ""It's interesting,"" the 69-year-old said in a phone interview Thursday, his second official day out of office. ""I was talking to a friend of mine recently and I hadn't thought about that. I started at the time of the Great Recession and then COVID (struck).""
But the crises between January 2009 and Tuesday, when he stepped down, have bookended a political career that Newman said he thinks lived up to the slogan on the yard sign from his first campaign he still keeps in his garage: ""Preserve, Conserve, Collaborate.""
""I'm definitely bittersweet about leaving,"" he said. ""I will miss the interaction with the other commissioners, the staff and the public at large, as well as being at the table making decisions that improve the quality of life for our citizens and keeping Pitkin County the special place it is. ""But I think it's time to sit back and smell the roses.""
His colleagues on the board and at the county said their goodbyes at a work session Tuesday. ""While George and I may not always agree, regardless of who won or lost the argument, we never held a grudge,"" Commissioner Patti Clapper said. ""We got over it and we moved on."" Clapper said she will miss Newman's humor, body language and facial expressions that never failed to wordlessly give away his true feelings.
""In closing, I have one bit of advice for George,"" she said. "" If you need to supplement your retirement income, you should not do this by playing poker."" Commissioner Greg Poschman praised Newman's candor.
""George has always said whathe thought,"" said Commissioner Greg Poschman, ""and I really appreciate that, even it might not have been the popular sentiment. I've certainly learned a lot from him to speak your peace and be OK with it.""
Newman grew up in New York state, went to college in New Hampshire and upon arriving in Aspen in 1974 promptly went to work as a ski patroller at Aspen Highlands. After thathe worked at Colorado Outward Bound as an instructor and course director, then helped found and run Leadership Aspen before being elected to the county board.
""I think I changed careers every 10 years,"" he said. ""The main focus has been the outdoors  and somehow tied to skiing, which is one of my loves and passions."" That love of the outdoors informed Newman's campaign slogan 12 years ago and, looking back, he said he feels he held true to those ideals.
Pitkin County's rural character has been preserved through the Open Space and Trails program, numerous conservation easements the county has negotiated and purchased, a program that leases county open space to agriculture and protection of water resources, he said.
Conservation also has been addressed during Newman's tenure through an overhaul of the energy codes, investment in renewable energy and approval of a solar farm near Woody Creek, he said. ""The greatest threat not only locally but globally is climate change,"" he said. ""We're doing a lot to mitigate climate change locally. We had to collaborate to accomplish our goals.""
Newman said he is proud of collaboration efforts that have come through his service on the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority Board, the Community Office for Resource Efficiency Board and regional transportation planning efforts, while also citing the county's multi-year effort to extinguish oil and gas leases in the Thompson Divide as a major accomplishment. However, none of those things rank as the most important accomplishment of his three terms on the board, he said.
""If you ask me, the best decision I ever made was hiring (county Manager) Jon Peacock,"" Newman said. ""He's been able to do such tremendous things for this community."" Peacock  hired almost exactly 10 years ago  has helped start the Valley Health Alliance, ably steered the county through the COVID-19 pandemic and reorganized the county in ways that benefit residents, among other accomplishments, Newman said.
""As elected leaders, we can put forth goals, but it requires leadership and staff to put them into place,"" he said. ""And I think that under Jon Peacock's leadership, staff has been able to do all this."" Newman said he will miss serving on the county commission but harbors no other political ambitions, for the time being at least because ""you never know what life will bring."" He declined to say exactly whathe might do next but said he will ""stay engaged and volunteer in areas that interest me."" And while Newman may slow down a bit now thathe's no longer a member of the county board, don't expect him to abandon the passions of skiing and the outdoors that brought him to the Roaring Fork Valley 46 years ago in the first place.
""I've got a pretty large quiver (of skis) here,"" he said. ""From alpine to Nordic to A-T, I enjoy all aspects of being on the snow.""
Not surprisingly, on his first full day as a regular citizen in 12 years, Newman skinned up Tiehack on Wednesday and didn't care one bit about the bimonthly regular commissioner meeting going on down below.
But there's also biking and hiking in the summer, a 6-month-old grandson with his daughter in California, and his wife of 41 years, who also recently retired, and their home in ""historic Emma"" to take up his time. He said he was always a bit worried about retiring and spending so much time around the house, but the pandemic has provided a nice adjustment period and he's ready for it. ""You know, we live in such a beautiful place,"" he said. ""I'm still healthy and, at a young 69, I'm still able to enjoy the outdoors.""

Prescribed burns planned for north of Steamboat Springs
Routt National Forest fire crews are planning to conduct multiple prescribed burns over the next few weeks in North Routt County. Suitable weather and fuel moisture conditions will determine the exact dates for burning; however, the projects could begin as early as late March.
Burn unit locations are on the Routt National Forest in the Mad Creek/Rocky Peak area. Multiple benefits of the burns include reducing the threat of wildfire to nearby communities and structures, as well as improving wildlife habitat by regenerating shrubs and aspen.
""After the Middle Fork Fire last summer, there is still hazardous fuel build-up between the fire footprint and the wildland urban interface in the Strawberry Springs area,"" said Michael Woodbridge, Hahns Peak/Bears Ears district ranger. ""These planned burns will allow us to improve forage for big game and reduce fuel loading at a time of year when weather and fuel conditions are not hazardous as they were last summer and fall. Snow, wet drainages and lower temperatures allow us to manage these burns.
""The burn unit areas are heavily used by the public, so implementing the project at this time of year also helps reduce impact to recreationists,"" Woodbridge added.
The Forest Service is coordinating with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and Routt County on the project.""
Prescribed fire treatment is planned for 400 acres near Mad Creek/Rocky Peak and possibly 340 acres off Routt County Road 36 around the Bear Creek Trailhead.
Burn units are comprised of mountain shrubs, grasses and aspen. While smoke may be visible from some areas during burning operations, due to the overall light fuel type, it should subside each evening. Pending weather conditions, smoke may settle in surrounding low-lying areas at nig ht.
Forest Service fire crews will monitor burned areas following operations until the fire is safely out.
For more project information, contact fuels specialist Lance Broyles at 970-870-2182 or Woodbridge at 970-870-2299.
United Way increases funding allocations to more than $500K
Routt County United Way is reporting an increase in the organization's 2021 allocations to a total of $505,000, which will be distributed to qualifying Routt County nonprofits in the 2021 grant cycle.
According to Routt County United Way Executive Director Kate Nowak, the increase in allocation is
the result of overwhelming support from local donors combined with additional funding from the Morgridge Family Foundation. This allocation year will be the largest in the local United Way's 37year history.
""I would like to thank the community for supporting children, adults, and seniors in our county,"" Nowak said in a news release. ""Due to the caring power of hundreds of Routt County citizens, we are able to give children a strong start, youth a safe and nurturing environment after school and in the summer and assist adults in sustaining financial stability.""
Nonprofits who applied to Routt County United Way's annual grant cycle will be eligible for these funds. Allocations will be awarded in May.
Permit applications now being accepted for upcoming special events
The city of Steamboat Springs is accepting applications for individuals and organizations considering hosting a special event or activity in the Yampa Valley, specifically within the city limits.
""Steamboat Springs has a reputation for hosting high-quality event productions that enhance the economics of the community ,"" said the city's Special Events Coordinator Rachel Lundy. ""Our process facilitates fun event experiences while minimizing community impacts and city expenses, which we believe is a win/win for all.""
The city requires events to obtain a special activity permit depending upon classifications, venues and city services. Events are broken into three distinct classifications based on set criteria -- special events, sports events and city/school/private activities. Fees vary by venue whether using a street, park, field or trail. If approved, event producers are required to attend pre-event meetings and after-action review of their events.
In addition, any special activity that reserves or has formal group use of a city facility, property, trail or right of way or utilizes city services that are not routinely provided must apply for a city permit. These could include but are not limited to festive, educational, recreational sporting, artistic or commercial activities including but not limited to sports tournaments, festivals, block parties, group exercise classes, organized trail runs, running and cycling races.
Lundy and Marketing and Event Specialist T ara Cusack serve as the primary contacts for special events across the city.

Adam Bianchi couldn't escape the charm of Summit County. Most recently working as the regional environmental coordinator at the United States Forest Service Rocky Mountain Regional Office in Lakewood, he only had the job for about a year before returning to familiar territory.
Bianchi served as deputy district ranger for the Dillon Ranger District from 2016 to 2020. During that time, he witnessed the Peak 2 Fire and Buffalo Mountain Fire while working on vegetation management and fuels reduction under district ranger Bill Jackson.
Originally from Iowa, Bianchi has been employed for 15 years with the Forest Service across the country as a forester, harvest inspector, timber sale administrator and more from South Dakota to California to Michigan.
""I've gotten to work at pretty beautiful and unique places across the country, and the Dillon Ranger District is definitely one of those that makes you excited to get up every morning and work with partners and the community.""
He loves being back in a small, tight-knit community as a place for him to raise his three daughters -- 6-month-old twins and a 2-year-old. He said the county is reminiscent of his childhood where he fostered a passion for the outdoors with hunting and fishing. He wants to make the land as healthy as possible while providing the public with various activities.
""There's limited places where you feel like you can escape and feel wild due to the amount of agriculture in the state,"" Bianchi said. ""I recognized from a young age the value of natural resources and public lands and what it means to people.""
Though the Lakewood job was a promotion, he couldn't pass up the opportunity to return and work on programs he believes in. Every day has different duties, buthe looks forward to working alongside the ski resorts as they make improvements, facilitating public input on various projects and dealing with fire prevention initiatives throughout the county.
""The regional office was a great experience, and I enjoyed my time,"" Bianchi said, ""but it just doesn't compare to actually physically being on the ground and getting your hands dirty in the projects and rubbing elbows with the community and partners.""
One of his main goals is to balance conservation and recreation when it comes to dispersed campsites and popular trailheads such as Quandary Peak. The district is high-use due to its proximity to the Front Range and connection to the resorts, so he wants to make sure facilities are safe and resources last for multiple generations.
There's also the balance of personal life outside of work. Like many Colorado residents, Bianchi is a fan of breweries and skiing, both of which happen to be abundant in the county. He can't pick a favorite place to ski, saying they each provide something different, buthe appreciates that his
office is down the street from Angry James Brewing Co.
As Bianchi replaces Jackson -- who went to work at Lake Tahoe Basin National Forest -- he is joined by Chris Stewart as the new deputy district ranger. Stewart followed in the footsteps of his father who also has 15 years of Forest Service experience under his belt and is coming from Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Washington. He's been in Washington for 6 1/2 years, using his hydrology background to focus on water quality issues, but has also worked in North Carolina and his home state of California.
Stewart will now be Bianchi's right-hand man.
""My goal is to be there for Adam and to help him with all the work the district is doing with partners internally and everything else,"" Stewart said. ""I'm going to try to learn and grow as much as I can.""
A sea kayaker, skier and landscape photographer, Colorado's mountains and outdoor recreation opportunities drew him to Summit County.
""Obviously, I'm moving quite a bit inland, but I know there's two reservoirs on the district that I'm pretty excited to take my boat out on,"" Stewart said.
He's visited the area on work-related trips, but only in the summer and fall, so he's eager to finally ski in Colorado and trade the ""Sierra cement"" for the snow he's heard so much about. However, like Bianchi, Stewart is most anxious to get to work.
""We're extremely excited to hit the ground running,"" Bianchi said. ""Chris and I haven't worked together before, so we'll be building our relationship, too. It should be a great opportunity, and we look forward to people reaching out to us introducing themselves. We're just really excited to get started.""
Bianchi and Stewart will start working by the end of April.

September 5, 2020  Estes Park Trail-Gazette (CO)  Colorado Association of REALTORS
With more than 200,000 acres of forests burned across the state over the past two months as a result of wildland fires, wildfire mitigation, insurance and REALTOR professionals continue to push for residents to evaluate and take action to help prevent the potentially devastating impact of fires to property, structures and lives.
The Colorado State Forest Service (CSFS) recently added to its arsenal of wildfire information and interactive tools available to the public with the launch of the wildland-urban interface risk index. With more than half of the state's population living in a wildfire prone area, the county-by-county index uses housing density combined with modeled fire behavior to determine where the greatest potential impact to people and homes is likely to occur.
The index for each county is presented as an infographic to provide a simplified, accessible overview of the various levels of wildfire risk for residents living in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) in that county. The index is intended to increase awareness of wildfire risk, particularly in counties with a significant amount of its population located in the WUI.
The documents containing the infographics are available in a PDF format through the Colorado Forest Atlas at coloradoforestatlas.org. The public can access and download the documents for each of the 64 counties in Colorado through a drop-down menu available in the Wildfire Risk Viewer application within the Colorado Forest Atlas. The example below shows the document with the risk index infographic for Mesa County.
The CSFS and its partners hope the tool will help initiate and raise awareness of wildfire risk and direct residents to available resources that support risk reduction actions.
""Every homeowner should be aware of the wildfire risk in their community and the associated responsibility to reduce that risk, not only to protect their property, but also to improve the safety of first responders,"" said CSFS Wildfire Mitigation Specialist Daniel Beveridge. ""There are numerous examples from the past few seasons showing that proactive wildfire mitigation efforts are effective and now is a perfect time for people across the state to take action.""
Although COVID-19 related restrictions have limited or completely prevented residents from conducting group mitigation activities, wildfire mitigation professionals with the CSFS, along with the Colorado Association of REALT ORS and the Rocky Mountain Insurance Association (RMIA), are encouraging individual homeowners to take advantage of any extra time at home to engage in a wide range of low-cost mitigation steps proven to protect homes and land and help reduce damage to structures and communities.
From completing home inventories, including photographs and video, to cleaning gutters and rooftops, to trimming backyard shrubs and trees, to removing flammable materials from the perimeter of the home, there are a wide range of easy steps that homeowners can complete as coronavirus restrictions keep people at home. Reviewing insurance policy details and updating
coverage are also key steps in the process, along with creating and reviewing evacuation plans and emergency toolkits.
""It's critically important we all take steps to prepare our properties and review our insurance policies as our drought conditions and wildfire risk continue to grow,"" said Rocky Mountain Insurance Association (RMIA) Executive Director Carole Walker. ""Using this increased time at home to create an inventory of personal belongings and checking in with your insurance professional to review coverage are projects we usually procrastinate that will help homeowners be financially prepared for wildfire and natural disasters.""
Based on recommended fire-mitigation activities from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the CSFS advises homeowners complete the following activities at home while practicing social distancing.

December 22, 2020  Pikes Peak Courier View (CO)  Breeanna Jent
El Paso County's two biggest hazards are floods and wildfires, according to a new countywide disaster plan approved Dec. 15.
The risk for both flooding and wildfires ranked ""high"" in the nearly 550-page Pikes Peak Regional Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, compiled over the last year by emergency managers with the Pikes Peak Regional Office of Emergency Management and approved unanimously by El Paso County commissioners.
The plan updates and consolidates the 2015 El Paso County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan and the 2016 City of Colorado Springs Hazard Mitigation Plan to include El Paso County, Colorado Springs, Calhan, Fountain, Green Mountain Falls, Manitou Springs, Monument, Palmer Lake and Ramah.
""This is the first time we've built a regional plan,"" Pikes Peak Regional Office of Emergency Management and Mitigation Manager Mike Schaub said. ""It provides a common operational picture of both hazards and mitigation strategies, allows for optimization of mitigation efforts in the Pikes Peak region, and improves chances of securing grant opportunities at the federal level.""
The plan identifies natural and man-made catastrophes affecting communities such as wildfires, flood, drought and hail. It assesses risk and pinpoints actions that can help regional emergency management staff reduce or eliminate injury, loss of life and property damage or loss due to natural disasters. It also provides a framework for the county and more than 80 stakeholders across the region to develop cost-effective projects that could prevent future damage.
Emergency planners used information from previous mitigation plans covering the county and Colorado Springs, review of state and local hazard planning documents, and information on the frequency, magnitude and costs associated with the hazards that have impacted or could impact the region to identify nearly 20 hazards that presented the greatest concern for the region this year.
Planners also sought out community feedback on draft versions of the plan, Schaub said, learning about the public's perceptions and opinions on community hazards, and identifying preferred methods and techniques to reduce risks and losses associated with each hazard.
""Even with the pandemic we got ... solid commentary from the public,"" Schaub said. ""We did make adjustments based on that.""
Fifteen additional hazards, from aircraft incidents to winter storms, were identified as moderate dangers to the county, with avalanche and sinkholes found to be the two lowest risks.
Regionwide, wildfire was the largest hazard, ranked as ""high"" risk in five of the eight municipalities, plus El Paso County, included in the plan. Floods and mud or debris flow were ranked as a moderate risk to the region overall, but ranked high in several individual communities across the county.
The Pikes Peak region has a long history of wildfires but has experienced an increase in the number of large and erratic fires over the last several decades.
""The increasing number, magnitude and impact of fires are the result of several factors, including expansion of the wildland-urban interface, prolonged droughts resulting in extremely dry and volatile fuels, a decline in foresthealth and an abundance of fuel due to fire suppression,"" the plan states.
Between 2010 and 2019 three regional fires burned more than 10 acres each, data show, with more than 73,000 total acres burned in that time.
El Paso County's three largest wildfires on record occurred in the six-year period between 2012 and 2018, data show. In June 2012, the Waldo Canyon fire burned 18,247 acres, destroyed more than 340 homes and killed two people. The Black Forest fire in June 2013 burned 14,280 acres, consumed 511 homes and damaged 28 others, and killed two people. In 2018, the MM 117 fire burned 42,795 acres in El Paso and Pueblo counties and destroyed 23 homes.
Areas downhill of burn scars like the Waldo Canyon burn scar, and areas along major and minor rivers and streams, pose flood hazards, according to the multi-hazard plan.
In April 1999 El Paso County, Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs and surrounding areas saw $44 million in combined damage because of flooding in the Monument Creek and Fountain Creek watersheds, data show. The flood damaged agricultural lands, irrigation systems, trails, roads, sewer treatment plants and other public and private property.
Major flooding across Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs, Black Forest , Cascade, Green Mountain Falls, Fountain, Security and Chipita Park in the summers of 2012 and 2013 caused more than $41 million in damage combined, data show.
Additionally, data from the Colorado Water Conservation Board show 34 repetitive loss properties -- those with two or more losses with at least $1,000 payments from the National Flood Insurance Program within a 10-year period since 1978 -- within the Pikes Peak Region. Of those, 19 are in Colorado Springs, 13 are in Manitou Springs and one is in Cascade. Sixty-eight percent are singlefamily residential homes, 6% are multifamily residences, 9% are businesses and 18% are classified as ""other.""
Some countywide wildfire mitigation strategies identified in the plan include encouraging communities to adopt fire adaptive community standards; identify areas for water cisterns or hydrants; conduct mitigation efforts on publicly-owned properties based on fire adaptive community standards; and enhancing communications about delay or closure of county facilities and roadways.
To mitigate flood risk countywide, the plan identifies strategies such as reducing roadway hazards, developing a strategic flood warning plan; and maintaining catch basins and debris fences in critical areas, to name a few.
Schaub said the plan's approval by the county was the final step before it is reviewed by the Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's regional office headquartered in Denver.
The plan's approval is expected by early January, he said.
""I don't expect any real showstoppers that would cause them to kick it back to us,"" Schaub said.
Once approved, all eight municipalities must meet with El Paso County each year for the next five years to review the plan and its mitigation actions. Then, leaders can decide whether they'd like to continue with mitigation efforts for identified hazards, pursue different mitigation strategies or ""kill"" current mitigation actions, Schaub said.

New_El_Paso_County_master_plan_wins_approval_from__Gazette_The_Colorado_Springs_CO___May_26_2021.txt,"El Paso County maste r p lan wins ap p ro val fro m - Gaze tte , The (Colorado Springs, CO ) - May 26, 2021
May 26, 2021  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Breeanna Jent
A new master plan that will guide local development over the coming decades received the stamp of approval Wednesday from the El Paso County Planning Commission.
Commissioners voted 8-0 to approve the plan, ending a 2 -year process to develop the nearly 200-page, 14-chapter advisory document. Commissioner Grace Blea-Nunez was absent from Wednesday's hearing and Commissioner Thomas Greer attended virtually but abstained from the vote, though he did not indicate why.
Planners have said updating the document was critical because El Paso County's population, including Colorado Springs, could hit more than 1 million people by 2045, data from the Colorado Demography Office shows.
""We're obviously facing a lot of growth right now and having the framework to address that growth in a smart way is incredibly important for El Paso County,"" Planning Commissioner Brian Risley said May 5, when the commission first opened the master plan adoption hearing.
The document will help planners evaluate future development proposals, establish a regulatory framework and coordinate regional and local initiatives, El Paso County Planning and Co mmunit y Development Deputy Director Mark Gebhart said Wednesday.
It will replace the county's policy plan created in 1998, various small area plans completed between 1977 and 2008, and more than 20 older sketch plans developed between 1982 and 1986, he said, while retaining dozens of drainage basin plans and other topical plans that include the county's parks and water master plans created in 2013 and 2018, respectively.
Planning advocate Judy von Ahlefeldt has long criticized the plan's adoption process, arguing residents could not adequately provide feedback on the plan because they did not have enough time to review it. The draft wasn't available to view until March 9, and when it was posted it was incomplete, missing the final chapter that lays out recommendations for how the plan should be implemented, she said.
County planners have said while obtaining public involvement was challenging, they disagreed their process was inadequate, citing community meetings where the plan was discussed prior to its development and arguing it was amply discussed at public Planning Commission, Board of County Commissioners and Master Plan Advisory Committee meetings. The last chapter was made available later because planners needed to review and vet each recommendation in the document, design firm Houseal-Lavigne Associates co-founder John Houseal previously said.
The Planning Commission did not agree to von Ahlefeldt's request not to approve the new plan Wednesday and instead hold their own public workshops to further discuss the document on a chapter-by-chapter basis. County staff, planners and the Master Plan Advisory Committee have considered hundreds of comments from residents and have revised the document using that
input, planners said.
""The fact that we don't agree with your suggestions does not mean we haven't considered them. It means we don't agree with them,"" Commissioner Tom Bailey said.
Planners incorporated minor changes into the draft Wednesday before voting to approve it, including language and map changes to provide more clarification, accuracy and consistency, they said.
Since the drafted plan was made public, residents have shared concerns it doesn't include specific considerations for conservation design or future water needs, topics planners said are discussed in the parks and water master plans.
""It's not a detailed 'here's everything' plan, as in a master plan for everything,"" Commissioner Tim Trowbridge said. ""We've tried to capture all the important concepts we need to consider as we go forward with land planning. We'll continue to have those separate sub-documents, like the water, transportation and parks plans, which do then drive down to the lower-level detail we need.""
The commission also did not agree to a request from several Black Forest residents to change the recommended minimum lot size from 2  acres within the forest 's timbered areas to 5 acres. Advocates of the change said denser development there presents fire, water and wildlife concerns.
There is already a precedent for 5-acre lots laid out in the Black Forest Preservation Plan first developed in 1974, Friends of the Black Forest treasurer T erry Stokka said during the May 5 advisory hearing. Because the new county master plan will supersede the Black Forest Preservation Plan, it ""strips the Black Forest of the last protection it had for lot densities,"" he said.
There are already several smaller-sized lots in the forest 's timbered area, Bailey said. Additionally, the master plan is an advisory document and not a regulatory document that changes zoning requirements, he said.
""Zoning can change, but it takes the people living at the property to do something about it,"" Bailey said. ""If Black Forest residents want to preserve Black Forest the way it is, the way you do that is to pass your property to your children and make sure they want to live on it, and not sell it to a developer or subdivide it.""
Kevin Curry, president of the Elkhorn Estates Homeowners Association and a former county planning commissioner, said earlier this month he was concerned the plan did not address what, if any, impact incorporation or annexation could have on the plan. County Planning and Co mmunit y Development Director Craig Dossey said referencing incorporation in the plan could infer the county is ""taking a side"" on the issue and that has not historically been the county's role.
""Incorporation occurs and that's a grassroots effort,"" Dossey said, referencing past discussions to incorporate Black Forest and Falcon. ""At this point, there's no formal request for any of that so I don't feel pressed to take that up under this master plan. It's something (the municipalities) can do under state law right now. I don't think we need to particularly champion state law.""
But ""simply acknowledging the possibility that independent incorporation might occur does not take a position any more than does including the word annexation,"" Curry said.
Residents were also frustrated the plan was difficult to download because of its large file size and said its font was too small to easily read, possibly preventing others from accessing the document.
Dossey said residents can contact his office to request printed copies of the plan. In the meantime, he said, his office will brainstorm how to better make it available and present those options to the Planning Commission in the future.
The Planning Commission must still certify the official plan for the Board of County Commissioners and all county municipalities, Gebhart said. The certification process to county commissioners could happen in late June, he said.

Nonprofits_in_Your_Neighborhood_Meet_the_Estes__Estes_Park_Trail-Gazette_CO___May_18_2021.txt,"o np ro fits in Yo ur Ne ighbo rho o d: Me e t the Este s - Este s Park Trail-Gaze tte (CO ) - May 18, 2021
May 18, 2021  Estes Park Trail-Gazette (CO)  Karen McPherson; Estes Park Nonprofit Resource Center
This week, the Estes Park Nonprofit Resource Center (EPNRC) shines a spotlight on the Estes Valley Watershed Coalition, an organization that was born out of the 2013 Colorado Floods, worked for years to rebuild waterways, and is now pivoting some of their focus to wildfire mitigation. Their vision is to protect and improve the waters, forests, and wildlife of the Estes Valley Watershed, the headwaters of the Northern Colorado Front Range. EPNRC spoke with Wilynn Formeller, Development and Program Coordinator for the Watershed Coalition.
What are you working on now that addresses your mission?
The Big T hompson biostabilization project. We started planning in late 2020 when we got a grant from the Colorado Water Conservation Board to help private properties plant plants that stabilize waterways. This project starts at Fun City and travels east along Riverside to Mary's Lake Road.
How do you find the private residents?
Back in 2016-7, the Watershed Coalition worked with Town of Estes Park and other partners to come up with master plans for some of the streams and rivers. There is one for Fish Creek, Upper Big T hompson, and Fall River. Those plans helped us prioritize what needed immediate work after the floods and rank projects depending on if they needed rock, sediment, or plants. We referred back to the master plans to find landowners
for the current project, we had about 10 property owners that wanted to participate, they have been wonderful.
What do they do?
They are supportive in letting us go out on the property and they will take care of the plants after we put them in the ground. We want them to survive--all the elk and other animals want to eat them.
There is a lot of fencing around waterway restoration projects. Do you always have to do that?
We will be fencing for probably about a year--maybe two tops--after we plant. Our consultant was telling us that when they couldn't get fencing up right after they planted, neighbors sent them pictures of the elk eating all the plants.
You mentioned you were planting willows this week?
Yes, all of the willows that we planted are native and do a great job of stabilizing the riverbanks, providing food for wildlife and habitat for the fish. The willow stakes we harvest locally, they will send out little suckers and will grow from a cutting really well. We are essentially propagating our own native plants to help recovery.
What are you most proud of?
The fact that the board and all of our volunteers and other groups have come together to keep the Coalition going. There was a time after the majority of flood restoration projects were completed that we had to redefine (along with other watershed coalitions) our role in the community. A few coalitions closed. Many of them were able to transition to other projects and find areas that needed ongoing support from the flood.
Did the Watershed Coalition exist before the flood?
No, we did not. The state and water conservation board received federal money to help with the restoration of waterways and that's how many watershed coalitions in our part of the state came to be. We were established to help facilitate projects and grants for flood recovery.
Will our local Coalition keep working into the future?
We have a lot of opportunities to continue to support the community. We have also become involved with different groups doing wildfire mitigation, including support for the Estes Valley Fire District which does not currently have a dedicated mitigation crew. We can help coordinate projects with property owners and we also have access as a nonprofit to funding for wildfire risk reduction.
What is the Town's role in wildfire mitigation?
They are very supportive right now, getting everything together so we can get the Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) updated. The CWPP planning helps bring together many local groups to discuss mutual concerns for public safety, community sustainability, and natural resources.
How is that plan related to the Comprehensive Plan?
They will be taking the wildfire plan into consideration when the Comprehensive Plan is created. Our current board president is Frank Theis, he is also supporting the Comprehensive Plan and how these two fit together and complement each other.
Who else do you collaborate with?
We are a part of the Northern Colorado Fireshed Collaborative (nocofireshed.org). That is a group of watershed coalitions that are working with other agencies, the State of Colorado, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Colorado Forest Restoration Institute. It's a really good resource for wildfire mitigation and communication.
Why does Estes Park need your organization?
The Watershed Coalition benefits the community with flood restoration that still needs to be done and other projects that benefit the Estes Valley waters, forests, and wildlife. We have the volunteer base, the ability to get funding, and the knowledge to get these projects off the ground.
How did you become a leader for these projects?
I have a background in wildlife ecology, in particular endangered species habitat assessment. This is what I enjoy.
Are you the only staff? Sounds like a lot to manage.
Yes. The Watershed Coalition is currently managing almost $250k in projects, coordinating five different projects. It's a lot.
T ell me about your core volunteer group.
I would say that is my board. There are eleven board members and a few other volunteers that are not currently on the board. Their main motivation is to have our waterways and forest be resilient to all the changes that are coming and here now: climate change, increased wildfires--and those wildfires leading to increased flooding and other issues in Estes and downstream.
A big token of gratitude to your board and volunteers.
They are amazing. Our board also started the Wandering Wildlife Society in 2019. That is an outreach group that hosts monthly wildlife talks. A recent topic was coyotes: their family units, what they eat, their hierarchy in the park. Our lecturer was from Yellow Wood Guiding (they do private tours in Rocky and Estes).
I recently saw you call out on the Estes Volunteers Facebook group for volunteers to help tourists understand how to be near elk?
We do elk outreach and education, volunteers are out wearing bright orange
vests during calving and rut season, passing out information cards about the elk and how to safely view the elk. This group meets with Chase Ryland, the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Ranger for Estes Park, before ever going out to talk with the community and visitors.
The ultimate goal is to have a conversation with the community and visitors alike about how to safely view elk or even how to take a better picture. Chase (or the police) is always available if volunteers or guests ever feel unsafe in a situation.
How can our community best support you?
By either volunteering to help out on projects, project support, or if private property owners are interested in having work done (or have a suggestion for a project), they should reach out.

Northeast Teller County Fire Protection District enjoying it.txt,"Northeast Teller County Fire Protection District enjoying its new
$330,000 Brush Truck

Life just got a little easier for wildland firefighters at Northeast Teller County Fire Protection District. If there is any luxury at all for the crews battling forest fires at home or away, the district's new brush truck teases the edges of comfort.
The seats recline, the refrigerator keeps food fresh, a pull-out table eases the burden of writing reports, and a cabinet holds luggage and equipment in a dry place.
""We used to throw our bags on top of the truck,"" said Greg Bodine. ""And then it rains We didn't enjoy living out of the old truck.""
As well, the shiny red truck has room for all the necessary maintenance supplies for fighting fires  shovels, saws, a 500-gallon tank, firefighting gear and equipment. If not used for fires in Teller County, the truck can be deployed to fight fires in other parts of Colorado, or in Arizona or California, for instance. For most deployments, travel time is six days to and from a site, with tent camping at night. When arriving at a site, the crews join others at a campsite. ""The camps are like small cities,"" said NETCO Captain Brian Stimits.
Deployments of five certified wildland firefighters away from the district is part of NETCO's commitment to building relationships. ""Our community is small and it benefits everybody if we understand how to work with each other,"" Stimits said.
With a $330,000 price tag, the brush truck was paid for by NETCO's capital-replacement fund. With each deployment, the district is reimbursed by the appropriate agency for the use of the truck and the crews. Because the firefighters' deployments take them out of the district, the agency also provides reimbursement funds for the home crews that cover the vacancies at the station in Woodland Park. The wildland firefighters are gone a minimum of 14 days, Stimits said. The truck was built by the same company hired by the state of California and the U.S. Forest Service. Stimits, along with Jonas Johnsen, was part of the apparatus committee that did the research for designing the truck.
While the crews may be called away to fight fires in other parts of the West, for now, Teller County is in a favorable spot due to the recent rains. ""This year is very green,"" Stimits said.

May 8, 2021  Greeley Tribune (CO)  Bruce Finley
RED FEAT HER LAKES -- Wind blowing down from burned forests caressed a knoll where leaders from the Biden administration and Congress sat in camp chairs Friday, looking over charts showing massive new fire breaks along Colorado's Front Range, mobilizing to combat cascading climate warming impacts.
Here is where last year's 208,913-acre Cameron Peak wildfire, the largest in Colorado's recorded history, ravaged woods long thought to be exceptionally resilient. Now rising risks of catastrophic erosion, flooding and mudslides have federal land managers on alert, warning of potentially irreversible damage.
And northern Colorado water supply managers are measuring turbidity three times higher than usual in the Poudre River as ash and sediment slumps into reservoirs.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a key player in carrying out President Joe Biden's climate agenda, anchored this summit, calling the intensification of wildfires in the West a crisis and declaring ""now is the time to dramatically infuse resources into forests.""
Americans ""are becoming more sensitive to climate change, and forests play an incredibly important role. We're committed to a net-zero U.S. agriculture industry by 2050, but that won't make any difference if our forests continue to burn up... Hopefully people will see the necessity of investing,"" Vilsack said in an interview.
""The country has waited too long,"" he said. ""The reality is we've spent an enormous sum of money putting fires out. If we had invested over the past 40 years we would not have to spend nearly as much money putting fires out. If you are a conservative and you are concerned about money, you can spend $1,400 an acre now or you can spend $50,000 an acre in the future to put out fires and then have to deal with the consequences.""
Gov. Jared Polis joined with the state's agriculture, public safety and natural resources chiefs, raising concerns from long-term foresthealth to immediate spring risks.
""The state backs up local responders,"" he said. ""We're ready to help where we can.""
Sen. Michael Bennet, whose legislation would devote $60 billion over a decade to boosting foresthealth and resilience around the West, pointed to the potential for creating thousands of new jobs.
And flanking Vilsack, U.S. Rep Joe Neguse, D-Lafayette, has proposed a 21st Century Civilian Climate Corps to bring on workers. Neguse has forged, with Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah, a new wildfire caucus structured to build bipartisan teamwork by requiring lawmakers who want to be members to enlist a colleague from their opposing political party.
""I didn't anticipate the two largest wildfires in the history of our state would burn through my
district at the same time,"" Neguse said in an interview, referring to the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires. ""But I feel more optimistic now about our ability to take action on climate than I've ever been. Public sentiment seems to have shifted rapidly because of the visceral impacts of climate change.""
Ambitious forest -thinning goals
Newly-appointed U.S. Forest Service regional chief Frank Beum helped convene the summit, drawing in agency experts. And they in turn brought in soil experts, landowners, university scientists and grassroots community organizers.
The knoll where they sat beneath surviving Ponderosa pines served as an example of what strategic tree-thinning to create fire breaks can do. Had that forestry work not slowed flames around an adjacent Boy Scout camp and spiritual center, federal foresters said, evacuations might not have been possible.
Widespread tree-thinning under consideration would remove up to 70% of trees in some forests. The goal is to revitalize ailing, overly-dense forests and slow anticipated future megafires with contiguous breaks from the Wyoming border south along the booming Front Range urban corridor to Interstate 70 in Denver.
Foresters said such a project would require close cooperation with landowners -- roughly 60% of land in Colorado is privately owned -- due to heavy tree removal.
Tony Cheng, director of the Colorado Forest Restoration at Colorado State University, said creating these breaks to manage wildfire risks would mean an overall loss of trees in forests. That would be necessary to combat climate change impacts, he and other experts told the leaders, because wildfires are growing and happening more often.
And foresters would have to commit to replanting strategically to maintain vegetation needed to help draw down carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping air pollution.
Bennet said he favors this effort but that it must be locally led.
""We are going to have long debates and discussions about how to do it. But there is no question that we need to do it in order to save what everybody loves about Colorado and the Rocky Mountain West,"" Bennet said in an interview. ""We risk losing that if we don't get ahead of these fires.""
He cited as a model the recent tree-thinning done on Douglas County land abutting federallymanaged forest . ""It feels like you're standing in a cathedral. It is beautiful. It is peaceful.""
Forest Service officials this week were seeking roughly $150 million to ramp up immediate wildfire burn-zone stabilization work, because regional resources at the start of the year barely reached $500,000.
""That money would help us secure the watersheds and reservoirs that are in great potential harm
if we get one of those rain events,"" deputy regional director Jacqueline Buchanan said, referring to the 2013 floods that caused havoc even when burn scars weren't so big.
""What worries me? The potential for loss of life and lasting impacts that we will never be able to overcome,"" Buchanan said. ""We have critically importantheadwaters here in Colorado and this continuous onslaught of impacts could eventually take them to a place that we could not recover from. We need all the tools in the toolbox, and prescribed fire is hugely important.""
""Outside the realm of preparedness""
Much depends, all agreed, on lawmakers allocating funds.
Polis in the aftermath of last year's record wildfires had contacted Vilsack directly, wanting increased federal attention to forests.
""Having them here, seeing the aftermath as well as the work we need to do collaboratively to prevent future fires and create natural barriers, is really critical,"" Polis said during Friday's gathering.
From the knoll, the leaders rode in a convey over a twisting back road into Poudre Canyon, where the Cameron Peak fire spread rapidly, threatening towns just west of Fort Collins, forcing an estimated 10,000 people to evacuate. They went to a firehouse in the frontline town of Rustic, where Poudre Canyon Fire District chief Hugh Collins and a dozen or so responders were waiting.
They needed a new ambulance, to replace their 20-year-old stalwart and be ready for emerging new threats. Fort Collins, Greeley and Northern Water officials said they needed help estimating future volumes of sediment they're likely to have to deal with in reservoirs as wildfires break out more often and intensify.
Polis accompanied utility officials to Chambers Reservoir near the top of the canyon where Greeley Water crews have been working to cut down standing dead burned trees on steep mountainsides and lay them horizontally across slopes to try to control erosion. Northern Water officials said they'll need to conduct aerial dropping of seeds and mulch to try to stabilize charred, eroding slopes around their reservoirs.
Grand Lake Mayor Steve Kudron told leaders the speed of the East Troublesome fire that burned through his community was horrific: ""completely outside the realm of preparedness.""

No_breathing_easy_in_Aspen_valley_due_to__Aspen_Times_The_CO___August_19_2020.txt,"o bre athing e asy in Asp e n, valle y due to - Asp e n T ime s, The (CO ) - August 19, 2020
Roaring Fork Valley residents probably won't be breathing easy any time soon.
The Grizzly Creek Fire has shrouded the valley with a thick blanket of smoke in recent days as winds have tended to be light and out of the north. When there is a reprieve from that fire, the Pine Gulch Fire north of Grand Junction pumps in smoke on the prevailing western winds.
The circumstances have got exercise junkies consulting their favorite new apps to see if it is safe to venture outside. One site that has emerged as a favorite for gauging small particulate matter, known as PM2.5, is www.purpleair.com.
Tuesday at 5:15 p.m., the site was showing a level in Aspen that could cause problems for people with existing lung issues but not for the general public. In Basalt, on the other hand, the level was high enough that the site warned, ""Everyone may begin to experience health effects if they are exposed for 24 hours.""
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on Tuesday issued a Colorado Smoke Outlook warning that ""evening smoke will begin to drain into lower lying areas surrounding both fires"" and heavy overnight smoke from Grizzly Creek will remain an issue into Wednesday.
William Basye, air quality adviser with the U.S. Forest Service, said at an online community meeting regarding the Grizzly Creek Fire on Tuesday night that the agency and partners have set up air monitors from Aspen to Glenwood Springs and out to Eagle and Vail. That is what they are basing their daily forecasts on. One monitor can cover ""an expansive area,"" he said.
""The smoke just wants to travel down at night. As it goes up and it comes down, it sinks down and sinks into the valleys,"" he said. ""We're seeing impacts all the way up to Aspen that are unhealthy to very unhealthy up there at night and then coming down to Carbondale and definitely down here in Glenwood Springs.""
Colleen Reid, an assistant professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Colorado Boulder, studies how air pollution from wildfiresmoke influences respiratory health.
""The bulk of the evidence shows that when there's high pollution during wildfire events, there is an increase in respiratory illness,"" she said Tuesday.
All people in the smoke zone can suffer from watery eyes, scratchy throat and a cough. People with existing conditions such as asthma may be forced to use medications more frequently and even visit their doctors.
The smoke and haze was so thick Monday afternoon that peaks such as Mount Sopris were obscured and the orange glow so common by late afternoon when smoke filters the sunlight gave way to gloom.
Reid said the fine particulates in wildfiresmoke produce the haze or dark cloud.
""That's just solid and liquid particles that are so small that they don't settle to the ground. They just remain suspended in the air,"" she said. ""The more of that there is, the more likely that there will be health impacts. If the air looks just a little bit hazy, that's probably not as bad as when it's really hazy.""
She advised people to do what they can to decrease their exposure to smoke. At a time when social distancing is required because of the COVID-19 crisis, options such as air-conditioned malls and movie theaters aren't as viable of a way to beat the heat and smoke. Reid said HEPA air filters are a good option in homes as are high quality filters in air conditioning units.
As for exercise, Reid advised consulting with apps for real-time measurements and using common sense.
""If you can see smoke, if your visibility is impaired, I would recommend not exercising outdoors during that time,"" she said. ""That's challenging for a lot of Coloradans who are very outdoors oriented.""
The exposure to the small particulates is magnified by exertion.
""Because of exercising you are taking in a larger amount of air because you're breathing more frequently and therefore you're getting a higher dose of the particles into your lungs. That's what the concern would be,"" Reid said.
Carbon monoxide levels aren't a big concern for people living downwind of a wildfire, according to the research. More research needs to be completed on other pollutants in wildfiresmoke, Reid said.
Extensive research has been done on particles.
""Regarding the particles, the large particles don't get as deep into the lungs so it's really the smallest ones that are of the most concern,"" Reid said. ""Any combustion will create some of these particles and wildfiresmoke does create lots of very tiny particles that get deep into the lungs and affect the alveoli and some of them can even transfer into the bloodstream and therefore travel throughout the body. Fine particles have been found in all parts of the human body because we breathe them in all the time.""
New research also shows that breathing in the particles can be detrimental down the road.
""There's an interesting study that came out last year that more people obviously need to replicate,"" Reid said.

Structures on the Colorado State University Mountain Campus were spared this past weekend as the Cameron Peak fire burned through the area driven by strong winds.
""We share our tremendous gratitude to all the fire personnel who worked for weeks to protect the campus -- thank so so very much,"" CSU President Joyce McConnell said Monday morning in the tweet.
Located about 24 miles west of Fort Collins at a 9,000-foot elevation, CSU's 1,600-acre Mountain Campus hosts ""research projects in a variety of academic disciplines, including wildlife biology, forestry, watershed science, biology and renewable energy,"" according to its website.
Firefighters installed fire protection apparatus on the mountain campus, including hoses, portable water reservoirs and sprinklers, anticipating the fire's wind-driven approach over the weekend. In close coordination with the Larimer County Sheriff's Office Emergency Services, firefighters continue efforts in and around the mountain campus, Sky Ranch Lutheran Camp and the Pingree Park community, fire officials said in a Monday morning briefing.
Firefighters have gained new containment along the northeast side from Forest Service Road 333 Road to Bellaire Lake, officials said. Firefighters continue to monitor the fire in Monument Gulch east along Old Flowers Road.
As of Monday, the fire has burned 134,559 acres, about 210 square miles, and it is 47% contained, according to InciWeb.
On Sunday, the fire was ""active"" in the morning before ""calming down as much needed moisture moved"" in just before noon, according to the Monday morning report. A light snow fell in the area.
Just before 2 p.m. Sunday, the evacuation order for Colorado 14 from Kelly Flats west to the Fish Hatchery was downgraded from mandatory to voluntary, fire officials said. ""Out of an abundance of caution, new closures were issued by the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Rocky Mountain National Park.""
Windy weather was expected in the fire area on Monday with gusts up to 40 mph. Skies are partly cloudy, with a high temperature around 50 degrees and relative humidity at about 25%, according to the forecast.

Office of Just Transition says action plan will focus on hel.txt,"Office of Just Transition says action plan will focus on helping communities and families while finding resources for transition away from coal

On the final day of 2020, the Office of Just Transition released its final action plan to the public, marking some four months of work from the release of the rough draft in August, narrowing down the plan to one final document to meet House Bill 19-1314's goals.
Colorado House Bill 19-134 established the advisory committee for a Just Transition plan, tasking the committee with developing recommendations for the state. Once the rough draft was completed, it was then turned over to the Office of Just Transition to write the final action plan to present to Governor Jared Polis.
The bill also declared that ""a strong and comprehensive policy is needed to invest new financial resources in coal communities that are seeking to diversify and grow their local and regional economies in a manner that is both sustainable and equitable."" Colorado was the first state to establish an office to help with the transition and to develop a statewide strategy to move away from coal.
The final action plan, which is 20 pages in length, focuses on helping coal communities transition to prosperous futures through six community strategies; protecting the economic security of coal workers and their families through four worker strategies; and commits to finding resources to support the transition through three funding strategies.
Colorado  much like the rest of the nation  is transitioning away from coal as a fuel for generating electricity, largely due to the increase in competition for other lower-cost energy sources, as well as laws and regulations to protect public health and counter climate change.
""While this transition is creating many new opportunities, it will also result in a loss of stable, high-paying jobs and economic opportunities in communities where coal is mined and burned to fuel the economy,"" the action plan states.
Worker strategies, according to the action plan, include the following: empower workers and their families to plan early for future success; encourage the federal government to lead with a national strategy for energy transition workers; prepare, for future consideration, a detailed state program to help displaced workers build skills, find good jobs, or start businesses; and explore strategies to protect family economic security through the transition.
Funding strategies include the following in the final action plan: develop realistic options for further state support of just transition strategies; work with utilities and mining companies to increase transition funding; and ensure the OJT has adequate capacity to continue to develop and implement this action plan.
""Our overarching goal is to avert yet another boom-bust cycle in Colorado by helping coal communities and workers transition to prosperous futures,"" the action plan states. ""Specifically, through a just transition we intend to help each community end up with more family-sustaining jobs, a broader property tax base, and measurably more economic diversity than when this process began in 2019.""
In the action plan, coal communities are defined as a ""a municipality, county, or region that has been or will be affected by the loss of fifty or more jobs in total from a coal mine, coal-fueled electrical power generating plant, or the manufacturing and transportation supply chains of either."" Moffat County is slated to lose more than 400 jobs due to the transition away from coal in the state of Colorado.
Knowing that, the Yampa Valley (Moffat, Rio Blanco, and Routt Counties) was deemed one of 11 Tier 1 Transition Communities in the state.
""While the actual closures of Colorado's remaining coal-fired power plants, and any related closures of coal mines, are at least several years off, jobs are starting to disappear from communities through attrition,"" the action plan says. ""Effective economic development and diversification strategies will take time and resources, and will require long-term commitment from all involved. So planning and implementation must and will start immediately."""
Officials_remind_residents_of_firework_ban_ahead__Summit_Daily_News_CO___July_4_2020.txt,"O fficials re mind re side nts o f fire wo rk ban ahe ad - Summit Daily Ne ws (CO ) - July 4, 2020
KEYST ONE -- With this year's Fourth of July fireworks show canceled in order to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, people may be tempted to light their own, a decision that is illegal in both Summit County and many places throughout Colorado.
In Summit County, fire restrictions prohibit the use and sale of fireworks, according to the county's wildfire prevention page. The only type of firework that is allowed are sparklers.
""In general, anything that flies or explodes is illegal,"" Summit Fire & EMS spokesman Steve Lipsher said. ""That's in all of our municipalities and in the county. It applies to private property.""
In late May, the Dillon Ranger District of White River National Forest enacted Stage 1 fire restrictions for the county. The restrictions also prohibit building, maintaining, attending and using open fires.
The county does allow fires for people who have obtained a permit from their fire district, however. Residents and property owners can obtain permits by using their district's Community Connect page.
The Red, White & Blue Fire Protection Service area covers all of the greater Breckenridge. Summit Fire & EMS covers Copper, Silverthorne, Dillon, Montezuma, Frisco, Keystone, Summit Cove, Wildernest, Mesa Cortina and the Lower Blue Valley.
In addition to obtaining a permit, the county has outlined other regulations that residents must follow when burning a legal fire:
* The device that holds the fire must have a protective screen
* The ground underneath the fire must be barren
* The fire has to be at least 15 feet away from anything that is flammable
* The fire can be no larger than 3 feet wide and 2 feet tall
* Only nontoxic fuel sources like wood or charcoal are allowed
While sparkler's are allowed in most public areas, Lipsher said people should be aware of how hot they can get.
""Even those burn at like 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit,"" he said. ""So they're not risk-free, and we prefer that people not use any type of fireworks.""
Lipsher said the firework ban's main purpose is to prevent wildfires.
""This is an arid western forest and fireworks can very easily start a wildfire and they have many, many times over the years,"" he said.
Public officials are urging residents to be especially careful this year because a wildfire would take up necessary resources used to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic.
People who are caught violating the firework ban will have to pay a $150 fine for the first violation, $500 for the second violation and $1,000 for the third violation, according to the county's firework ordinance. The penalty is even worse for people who cause a wildfire, Lipsher said.
""If you start a wildfire it escalates from there,"" he said. ""There's arson potential, there's prison time potential and, of course, all of the costs of fighting a wildfire. It's bad news you do not want that.""
Fire Activities Prohibited In Summit County
* Building, attending and using open fires
* Fireworks
* Use of tracer ammunition
* Use of any projectile containing explosive material, incendiary material or other flammable chemical substance
* Disposal of any burning object outdoors, including cigarettes, cigars and matches

Offsetting_the_tough_toll_on_Mother_Nature_in_2020__Post_Independent_Glenwood_Springs_CO___March_28_2021.txt,"In normal times, Roaring Fork Outdoor Volunteers has plenty of opportunities for trail maintenance and ecosystem restoration projects from Independence Pass to Rifle Gap.
These are anything but normal times. Two events have made the demand soar for RFOV's expertise in harnessing volunteers to undertake projects on public lands.
First, wear and tear on hiking and biking trails was magnified last year as record numbers of people escaped COVID confinement by venturing into the great outdoors.
Second, the Grizzly Creek Fire swept across about 33,000 acres in Glenwood Canyon in August, creating the need for restoration on some of the charred lands.
RFOV is responding to the extra demands as well as tackling its usual list of projects this year. The nonprofit organization has a variety of projects scheduled from April through October.
""We are preparing for 77 project sites across our four county service areas, with about 10 percent of projects open to all and about 90 percent organized for civic, business, youth and faith groups,"" said Jacob Baker, communications and engagement.
Public land managers in the region estimate that usage on the most popular trails increased between 40 percent and 60 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Some projects will provide muchneeded maintenance to some of the hardest hit routes. For example, RFOV is teaming with Wilderness Workshop and Independence Pass Foundation on a weekend project to repair braided and broadened trail sections on the Lost Man Loop on Independence Pass. Volunteers will backpack in with crew leaders to undertake the work.
American Lake in the Castle Creek Valley will also be targeted for trail maintenance in a single-day project in June.
Another heavily used trail network is at Sky Mountain Park, owned and managed by Pitkin County
Open Space and Trails. RFOV crews will trim vegetation and improve drainage on trails there in October.
On the wildfire front, RFOV is part of the Glenwood Canyon Restoration Alliance, a group dedicated to aiding in the rehabilitation of the burn scar. June 5 will be the first of several workdays within the Grizzly Creek Fire area in 2021. The scope of work will be determined in May.
""Opportunities will be created to engage community members as much as possible,"" RFOV said in news release about its 2021 projects. ""RFOV anticipates that our commitment to the Grizzly Creek Trail -- and across the Grizzly Creek Burn Area -- will be sustained across multiple years of on-theground work.""
RFOV will also host several types of the projects its become known for since it was founded in 1995. It will hold regular workdays on Tuesdays in May to build a new trail on Sutey Ranch outside of Carbondale. The new multi-use trail will connect County Road 112 with Red Hill Mesa.
Another weekend project that stands out is the Marble Stewardship Extravaganza, a variety of projects in the town of Marble and in the surrounding national forest on the weekend of July 2425.
RFOV will also revisit the Lake Christine Fire burn scar above Basalt this year. Volunteers will have a chance to combine an educational hike with a community project. They will remove invasive weeds that have taken root in the post-fire landscape. Hundreds of volunteer turned out to help heal the burn scar in summer 2019, a year after a wildfirescorched slopes on and around Basalt Mountain.
RFOV's full list of projects will be released and registration opened on its website to members April 1 through 15. Registration will be opened to the public-at-large on April 16.
In addition to work projects, there are gatherings called Trail Mixers and special training opportunities on the calendar. On June 12, RFOV will work with Colorado Fourteeners Initiative to train volunteers to serve on high peaks and trailheads to greet trail users, provide basic information and gather use statistics, among several duties.
RFOV hosted more projects than usual in 2020, in part because it couldn't hold big community events because of pandemic capacity restrictions and also because of increasing interest.
""We're expecting an increase of about 20 percent in volunteer hours,"" Baker said.
Part of the anticipated increase is due to a general interest among people in helping restore the burn scar, he said. In addition, people were not only inspired to get outside during the tough year of 2020, they were inspired to preserve and maintain special places, according to Baker.
The organization expects that desire to carry over to 2021.
""People do want to connect with their neighbors and their friends,"" he said.
And that spirit is what led to RFOV's theme for 2021: ""Renewing landscape and community through collective action.""

One_of_Jonathan_Coops_first_vivid_memories_as_a__Ag_Journal_La_Junta_CO___July_3_2020__pA6.txt,"O ne o f Jo nathan Co o p 's first vivid me mo rie s as a - Ag Jo urnal (La Junta, CO ) - July 3, 2020 - p age A6
July 3, 2020  Ag Journal (La Junta, CO)  Colorado State University  Article  Pag e A6
One of Jonathan Coop's first vivid memories as a child was watching the flames of the 1977 La Mesa Fire in north-central New Mexico. The human-caused fire burned more than 15,000 acres of pine forests in the Bandelier National Monument and areas surrounding the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Now a forest ecologist and professor at Western Colorado University, Coop studies the ecological effects of fire on forests in the Southwest United States. He's also the lead author of a new scientific synthesis about how wildfires drive changes in forest vegetation across the United States. Sean Parks -- research ecologist with the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station -- and Camille Stevens-Rumann, assistant professor in the Department of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship at Colorado State University, are co-authors of the synthesis.
""Wildfire-driven forest conversion in Western North American landscapes,"" was published July 1 in BioScience.
The new paper, with contributions from more than 20 researchers, uncovers common themes that scientists are reporting, including increasing impacts of wildfires amid climate change from the borderlands of Mexico and Arizona to the boreal forests of Canada.
Following high-severity fire , scientists have found forest recovery may increasingly be compromised by lack of tree seed sources, warmer and drier post-fire climate and more frequent reburning .
""In an era of climate change and increasing wildfire activity, we really can't count on forests to come back the way they were before the fire ,"" said Coop. ""Under normal circumstances, forest systems have built-in resilience to disturbance  they can take a hit and bounce back. But circumstances aren't normal anymore.""
The loss of resilience means that fire can catalyze major, lasting changes. As examples, boreal conifer forests can be converted to deciduous species, and ponderosa pine forests in the southwest may give way to oak scrub. These changes, in turn, lead to consequences for wildlife, watersheds and local economies.
Assisted migration' an option in some cases, places
Researchers said that in places where the most apparent vegetation changes are occurring, such as the Southwest U.S. and in Colorado, land managers are already exploring ways to help forests adapt by planting tree species that are better suited to the emerging climatic conditions following severe fire.
""In places where changes are not quite so visible, including Montana and Idaho, those conversations are still happening,"" said Stevens-Rumann. ""In these large landscapes where trees
are not coming back, you have to start getting creative.""
Parks, who often uses data collected in protected areas to study wildfire patterns, causes and consequences, said some fires can be good, creating openings for wildlife, helping forests rejuvenate and reducing fuel loads.
""However, some fires can result in major changes to the types of vegetation,"" he said, adding that this is particularly true for high-severity wildfires when combined with the changing climate. ""Giving managers information about where and how climate change and wildfires are most likely to affect forest resilience will help them develop adaptation strategies to maintain healthy ecosystems.""
Stevens-Rumann said that land managers have largely continued to operate in the way they've done in the past, replacing fire-killed trees with the same species. ""Given the effects of climate change, we need to start being much more creative,"" she said. ""Let's try something different and come up with solutions that allow natural processes to happen and interact with landscapes in different ways.""
Coop said that ecologists and managers are beginning to develop a suite of approaches to increase forest resilience in an era of accelerating change.
One approach thathe said he's partial to is allowing fires to burn under benign or moderate fire weather conditions  similar to what happens in a prescribed burn  which results in forests that are less prone to high-severity fire because of reduced fuel loads and patchy landscapes. This is also known as managing wildfire for resource objectives, an approach that researchers said is cost-efficient, allowing managers to treat more acres.
""Increasingly, we're realizing you either have the fires you want and can influence or you're stuck with these giant fires where, like hurricanes, there's no shaping their path,"" said Coop.
Loss of forests is personal
For many of the researchers involved in this synthesis, the issues being analyzed are personal.
Before becoming a scientist, Stevens-Rumann spent three years on a USDA Forest Service ""Hotshot"" crew, specializing in fighting fires in hard-to-access and dangerous terrain. Parks grew up in Colorado and California and acknowledges seeing changes in the forests and landscapes he grew up with.
Coop said he's seen an incredible amount of forest lost in the Jemez Mountains where he grew up. The La Mesa fire was only the first in a series of increasingly large and severe fires, culminating with the 140,000-acre Las Conchas fire in 2011. Within the footprint of Las Conchas, less than a quarter of the landscape is still forested.
""Seeing these things unfold over my lifetime, I don't know if I ever really could have imagined it,"" he said. ""I've borne witness to these very dramatic changes unfolding in the one place that I really know best on Earth.""

Wildfires can be enigmatic.
Fire officials are well aware of the variables that dictate how a wildfire will behave: the moisture levels in fuel sources that have been adapting to changes in the climate , the direction and speed of the wind, and the severity of slopes along the landscape.
But even the slightest change in conditions can alter a fire's path and intensity, creating an entirely new outlook on the situation as emergency workers rush to gather intelligence and adjust their suppression tactics.
For some firefighters, the dance serves as a reminder that what they're up against is an uncompromising and devastating force of nature, and it isn't to be underestimated.
""It's an interesting thing -- and it only comes with experience -- to see Mother Nature rage like that and to be comfortable with it,"" Red, White & Blue Fire Protection District Capt. Derek ""Goose"" Goossen said. ""We'll try to predict what she's going to do today. But really, she's going to do whatever she wants. Nine times out of 10, she's going to say, 'Screw you, humans.'
""We'll look at the tactics we use and the strategies we can try and see what kind of effect we can have on a force like wildfire. It's intriguing to see that struggle between humans and Mother Nature, to watch the arm wrestle that happens and see who comes out on top. Sometimes we win. Usually we lose.""
Defending the wildland-urban interface
Modern developments in firefighting tactics and technologies are providing officials a fighting chance. And when you're battling Mother Nature, ithelps to be proactive.
Experts say that some of the best tools they have against wildfires are preventative: educating the public along the wildland-urban interface about best practices in fire safety and creating fire breaks in sensitive areas.
""There's an old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"" said Jeff Berino, former chief at Summit Fire & EMS and a fire investigator. ""The more we can do to raise the awareness and prevent the fire from happening in the first place is a win. Common sense is a lot of that, but when you look at what's causing wildfires, it's mostly humans.""
Berino pointed to programs offered in Summit County -- like the chipping program, home defensible space audits and wildfire preparedness classes offered by the fire districts -- as necessary efforts to help get community members ready for potential fires.
Hazardous fuels reduction projects also have become more frequent over recent years, essentially
serving to break up the continuity of fuel sources in an effort to reduce the risk of wildfires in the wildland-urban interface and provide firefighters with safer environments to engage fires.
Locally, officials have lauded projects like the U.S. Forest Service's efforts near the Wildernest and Mesa Cortina neighborhoods in 2011 -- when 300- to 500-foot-wide fire breaks were cut -- thathelped to protect about $1 billion in property during the 2018 Buffalo Mountain Fire .
Other efforts are ongoing. At the end of March, the Forest Service approved the Peak 7 Hazardous Fuels Reduction project, which will treat about 522 acres of forested land near Breckenridge, creating 400- to 600-foot-wide community protection zones in areas identified as high risk.
""I think it's critical,"" said Ross Wilmore, wildland fire specialist with the Greater Eagle Fire Protection District. ""Defensible space measures really give firefighters a chance. It gives them some time and space to work with. ... If you've got a homeowner that has done defensible space work on their property, and we've done a little fuels reduction on the national forest land, that's the best of both worlds. We have room to work on public land, and what's behind us is a tactically advantageous situation.""
Deciding on a response
Officials think of wildfires on a scale of 1-5 based on a number of variables including size, fuel type, complexity and values at risk.
Type 1 fires are the most severe, often requiring hundreds or even thousands of personnel on scene for firefighting operations and logistics work to manage shelter, water, food and more. A Type 5 fire likely could be managed by a single engine within a day. Berino said most wildfires in the Summit County area are Types 4 or 5.
Once a plume of smoke hits the skyline, emergency workers immediately go to work assessing the blaze. A decision could be made to manage or try to steer the fire if it's determined to be in a safe place. But fires that threaten human lives, structures and other valuable assets like watersheds draw an immediate suppression response.
The first conversations take place around intelligence and tactics. If a wildfire has shown signs of growing, officials will call in a multimission aircraft equipped with state-of-the-art infrared and color sensors, which can provide a detailed perimeter of the blaze and point out hidden hot spots.
""They'll be orbiting at 20,000 feet above the fire, and I've had one radio me for a quarter-sized hot spot,"" Goossen said. ""I couldn't see anything hot; I was sticking my fingers in the ground to look for it. The (multimission aircraft) told me to walk 20 feet to the north, turn left and walk 5 feet. ... Sure enough, there was a little spot fire starting underneath some bushes.""
Depending on the reconnaissance gathered, more air support could be called in to try to stymie the wildfire's growth quickly. Generally, firefighters can engage flame lengths of 3 to 4 feet or up to about 12 feet with fire engines.
The main goal in wildfiresuppression is to place containment lines around the entire fire, essentially putting it in a box where surrounding fuel sources have been removed or otherwise treated. Firefighters compare their maps to the images they're receiving from the multimission aircraft and carefully choose where they're going to try to create containment lines and battle the blaze. Of course, given the dynamic nature of wildfires, there's always a Plan B and C.
""There's a decision tree on where we're going to try and stop the fire,"" Berino said. ""And there are always backup plans in case it escapes our box. There's a critical-thinking aspect of this where we have to stay ahead of what the fire is going to do, to think about where it's going to be in two days, three days or a week.""
Air show
Once a fire hits the crown, or if it's already bearing down on a residential area, firefighters look to the sky for help.
It could take hours for additional firefighters to arrive from other jurisdictions or for local responders to hike into the forest and position themselves in the right areas. But aircraft can start to head off the fire in a matter of minutes, dropping slurry to serve as the first containment lines.
""We can get aircraft to drop slurry on the fire and start that box long before we can get the dozens or hundreds of firefighters we need on the ground,"" Berino said. ""We may have crews coming from the Front Range, Grand Junction or Glenwood, and that's going to take several hours. We can get aircrafthere in the 20- to 30-minute range.""
Slurry is a mixture of water and inorganic compounds that form a clay-like substance that inhibits combustion. Berino said single-engine air tankers can drop between 400 and 600 gallons of slurry, while DC-10s and the 747 Supertanker responding to major fires can dump about 12,000 to 20,000 gallons at a time.
Responding helicopters -- again given a type rating -- dump buckets of water directly onto hot spots in the fire to help cool things down.
With a multimission aircraft flying high overhead and tankers and helicopters skimming the treetops, there's also an air attack supervisor circling in the sky providing directions to aircraft and advising firefighters on the ground of upcoming slurry drops.
Building containment
The aircraft's efforts are mirrored on the ground below, where officials and firefighters have been running through checklists in preparation for engaging the fire.
Lookouts have been put in place with binoculars to keep an eye on other firefighters and report changes in fire behavior. Communications have been opened between fire crews and aircraft. Escape routes have been planned, and safety zones have been designated.
Firefighters also will have to make a decision to engage a fire directly or indirectly. An indirect
attack essentially means officials are choosing to engage the fire on their own terms, allowing it to burn to a fire break, road or some advantageous natural feature where they can set up engines and water lines to help douse the flames.
In a more direct attack, firefighters most frequently will use a technique called anchor, flank and pinch. The idea is to find an anchor point near the back of the fire -- called the heel -- that would be difficult to burn over, like a cliff, road or wetland. From there, it's all about building containment lines along the fire 's sides, always trying to keep downhill with the wind at their backs.
""We'll construct hand lines on one or both of the flanks, and eventually we'll try to steer those hand lines together to pinch the head of the fire and put it out,"" Goossen said. ""... That's really hard to do in heavy timber, because you can't outflank a fire with that much energy, and it could be starting spot fires. Usually, we'll back way off and try to construct a really bolstered line days ahead of the fire.""
In ideal conditions, firefighters can bring in bulldozers to clear out trees and other vegetation quickly, but in forest terrain, it's often up to hand crews carrying chain saws to do the dirty work.
In regard to spot fires -- ignitions outside the perimeter of the main fire caused by flying embers -- firefighters are constantly on the lookout. Crews will pump water along the containment line, through an engine or something more portable, and pretreat the opposite side of the line to prevent spot fires and keep the main blaze from jumping the line. There also are regular patrols of firefighters walking back and forth in a grid to catch any ignitions.
""People think firefighters are always staring at the flames,"" Goossen said. ""But we always have our backs to the fire . We're on the line looking for spot fires. We know the main fire is coming to us, and we don't care. We care about embers flying over our heads. ... If you don't spot them, all your efforts are for nothing.""
If other tactics fail, officials can always fight fire with fire .
In a process called back-burning, firefighters will find an area within the inner edge of the fire line and light their own fires using drip torches to try to expend fuel sources before the wildfire reaches the area. In more severe cases, firefighters will even perform heli-torch operations, dropping small pingpong-ball-like incendiary devices to start more widespread fires below.
""If you've got a big crown fire where you can't really get near it and retardant isn't going to make an impact, what you tend to do is back off to a distance and find an area that's comprised of less intensely burning fuels,"" Wilmore said. ""It really does two things: burning out the fuel between you and the control line you're constructing, and allowing firefighters to work in a fuel type they can manage in terms of heat and fire intensity.""
Once a fire has been contained and starts to lay down, slowly burning down whatever remaining fuel sources still have flames, firefighters will do some final mopping up of the area, taking to grid formations again to methodically check for remaining hot spots to put out.
And while mechanical or handmade containment lines, slurry drops and back-burning are all
effective in their own right, the tactics tend to work best together.
""We generally try to get a combination of air, engines and hand crews,"" Berino said. ""Very seldom is it one thing but all three in concert together: the aircraft to knock it out of the trees and to slow down the head of the fire, the engines providing water to protect structures and hit hot spots, and firefighters on the ground with hand tools and hose lines.""
The human element
For the firefighters working on a wildfire, the experience can be physically and mentally draining.
One of the core values of wildland firefighters is physical fitness, requiring someone to be able to climb a mountain with 70 or more pounds of gear without sacrificing situational awareness at the top.
The living conditions also are less than ideal.
""It's an unhealthy, hot, dirty environment,"" Goossen said. ""There are 13 known carcinogens in wood smoke, and we don't use any breathing apparatus on wildfires. It's very common to get smoke headaches for days on end if you're on the front line. And you get black boogers. ...
""Sometimes you get good meals, and sometimes you're just getting MREs just to keep you going. It's typical for us to work 16-hour days. You go to sleep tired and wake up at 6 in the morning and do it all over again for 14 days straight.""
Others expressed that wildfires were a source of stress for themselves and their families.
""When I was younger, it was more fun than it becomes as you get older,"" Summit Fire & EMS engineer Frank Towers said. ""I have a wife and a couple young boys. That definitely takes a toll on you. You're not there to help with home life. It's not just a sacrifice I'm making, but my wife is having to work double time to pick up the slack. Knowing that can definitely wear on you. You miss your family when you're out there.""
Some even warned of long-term mental health effects.
""There's a bond that you build among firefighters that's based on shared experience, shared hardship, shared challenges,"" Wilmore said. ""Those bonds are very strong. But all that hardship and stress and fatigue comes at a cost. I think we're beginning to understand that cost.
""There's long-term mental health suffering that firefighters and other emergency workers go through, and we need to provide more support for people that in their fire careers see something that keeps them up at night or just experience the stress of going out to fires over the years and suffering small traumas over and over again. ... This is a stressful job, and it does exact a toll on you.""
And of course, there's always the risk of serious injury or death. In the United States alone, there were at least 160 wildland fire fatalities between 2008 and 2017 according to the National
Interagency Fire Center.
""To those that say they're never scared, baloney,"" Berino said. ""The key is staying ahead of the fire and having respect for what it can do. There are times when the hair on the back of your neck goes up. There are times when the fire is just marching to its own tune, and you have to just respect that. It's not a time or place to be a hero. It's just not.""

As if Southwest Colorado's extreme drought wasn't enough to raise concerns about a potentially destructive wildfireseason, the added complications of the coronavirus have only fueled that anxiety.
The COVID-19 outbreak demands people isolate as much as possible to reduce the spread of the virus, but a typical wildfire response requires firefighters to work in close contact, under stressful conditions and in the presence of hazardous smoke.
In sum, things people should not be doing amid a global pandemic.
So how, exactly, are emergency personnel going to navigate this harrowing juxtaposition, along with other challenges that come with the coronavirus outbreak, should a large wildfire ignite?
""I think that all of us in the fire service, nationwide, are concerned what it's going to look like if we get a major event going,"" Hal Doughty, chief of Durango Fire Protection District, said recently.
""But some community, somewhere, is going to draw the unlucky card and have the big fire of the year. And we need to figure out what we need to do to keep firefighters and the community safe,"" he said.
Conditions already dryThe risk for a major fire breaking out right now is high.
From October to April, the region saw just 70% of its average precipitation levels. This winter, the ground in the high country froze before snow arrived and was not able to absorb moisture. Lower elevations barely received any snowpack.
On top of extreme drought, firefighters face new challenge: COVID-19
More recently, spring has been all but devoid of moisture. Unusually high temperatures have caused snowpack to melt earlier than normal. And soils are incredibly dry, a sign that fuels on the ground are ripe to burn.
""Unless we get some precipitation, we're going to be fighting a lot of fires,"" said Butch Knowlton, director of La Plata County's Office of Emergency Management.
This week, La Plata County entered Stage 1 fire restrictions.
Virus complicates responseThe U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment for this story. However, at a La Plata County meeting earlier this week, Richard Bustamante, fire manager for the San Juan National Forest , said the coronavirus outbreak delayed and complicated planning efforts for the upcoming wildfireseason.
In recent weeks, the Forest Service has enacted fire restrictions and started to mobilize its wildfire response teams. But should a fire break out, the risk to firefighters remains a top concern.
""As much as we want to have a normal response to any new starts ... it's going to be harder this year,"" Bustamante said.
On top of extreme drought, firefighters face new challenge: COVID-19
Firefighters work side-by-side digging fire lines or back burning. They eat together, and sleep in large encampments. While typically made up of young people, fire crews endure significant stress, poor sleep and hygiene, and inhale dangerous smoke and dust.
Bustamante said the Forest Service held virtual trainings in recent weeks to limit human interactions and had crews quarantine before coming on. As of Tuesday, he said there were no reported positive cases of COVID-19 in the ranks.
""It's not just everyone in tight quarters looking over a map like it used to be,"" he said. ""People are separating .""
Federal guidelines released last week recommend fire managers use small crews to limit widespread close contact among firefighters, and these crews should stay away from other large groups. The guidelines also recommend avoiding traditional large camps and say everyone should wear masks and other protective equipment when around those outside their immediate crew.
Keeping fires at bayOne of the main concerns is a major fire breaking out that requires assistance from firefighters across the country.
""We don't want anything to grow in size where we need outside resources,"" Knowlton said.
On top of extreme drought, firefighters face new challenge: COVID-19
John Lee, chief of Fort Lewis Mesa Fire Protection District, said earlier this week La Plata County's four fire districts have been in close contact to coordinate mutual aid, given this potential complication.
""Our resources are a little thinner on the federal side right now,"" he said.
Knowlton added La Plata County Road and Bridge Department crews are supplying big water trucks so fire districts can concentrate on fighting fires and not worry about securing water to douse a blaze.
And this year, Bustamante said, the Forest Service is in full-suppression mode.
In recent years, the Forest Service has been using wildfire as a means of better managing the landscape, allowing blazes to burn to mimic when fires were part of the forest 's natural cycle.
But now, even though it would be hard to keep any fire under relative control given the dry
conditions, Bustamante said COVID-19 poses additional risk, not just to firefighters, but also to the general public.
""COVID-19 is a respiratory issue, and smoke in the air does nothelp,"" he said. ""Does that mean we'll catch everything? No. But we'll give it our best effort, absolutely.""
Avoiding the worstLa Plata County's Knowlton said managing evacuations and evacuation shelters are yet another challenge.
During past fires that required evacuations, very few people needed an emergency shelter, staying instead with family and friends. But with the COVID-19 outbreak, people may be less willing to house evacuees.
""It's something we all have to think about,"" Knowlton said. ""Maybe we put people in hotel rooms. It's a case-by-case scenario.""
On top of extreme drought, firefighters face new challenge: COVID-19
Already, fires are starting to break out on the landscape in Southwest Colorado at an accelerated rate, with blazes northeast of Durango, north of Bayfield and on Fort Lewis Mesa, southwest of Durang o.
Bustamante, too, said public lands are experiencing ""unprecedented use"" for this time of year, with crowds comparable to the Fourth of July. And with it, Forest Service crews are finding a high number of abandoned campfires.
As a result, tighter fire restrictions are likely in the coming days and weeks. But getting federal, state and local agencies on the same page is essential to having a coordinated effort against a potential blaze.
""It's going to be a potentially bad year for us with the dry conditions out there, and the COVID-19 limitations will make it even more difficult,"" Knowlton said. ""Can you imagine something like the COVID-19 outbreak during the 416 Fire?""

Opposing_Bidens_vision_for_public_lands_hard-__Journal_The_Cortez_Dolores_Mancos_CO___May_11_2021.txt,"O p p o sing Bide n's visio n fo r public lands, hard- - Jo urnal, The (Co rte z, Do lo re s, Manco s, CO ) - May 11, 20 21
May 11, 2021  Journal, The (Cortez, Dolores, Mancos, CO)  Nancy Lofholm
At least four counties have signaled resistance to 30X30 plan
Land grab or precious-resource preservation?
The battle over where the truth  and where Westerners' hearts  lie on that matter is rumbling through Colorado counties as a federal government initiative nicknamed 3030 gains momentum, and opposition.
Colorado has become the beachhead in a Texas-based group's efforts to use local governments to thwart the Biden administration's proposal to preserve 30% of the nation's land and water by 2030. The proposal is part of President Joe Biden's January Executive Order on T ackling Climate Change at Home and Abroad.
The American Stewards of Liberty has been whipping up anti-3030 sentiment and pushing county commissioners to pass resolutions opposing the proposal even before its details are known. The nuts and bolts are being hashed out by the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Agriculture Department.
The American Stewards, a group steeped in anti-government land battles, has succeeded in convincing at least four Colorado counties that local officials won't like what is to come. Garfield County, where the federal government owns more than 62% of the land, in February became the first in the nation to pass an anti-3030 resolution. Moffat, Rio Blanco and Las Animas counties more recently followed suit.
""Here we go again with top-down policies from Washington, D.C., that have direct and adverse effects on local communities,"" Republican Garfield County Commissioner Tom Jankovsky wrote in a letter to the departments of Interior and Agriculture decrying the initiative.
Garfield County's resolution included a statement that lands left in undisturbed states are a burden on local counties because they are ""highly susceptible to wildland wildfires, insect infestation and disease.""
It did not mention how much Western Colorado counties have come to rely on outdoor recreation on public lands.
Moffat County's commissioners wrote in their opposition resolution that the top 10 taxpayers in that northwestern Colorado county are dependent on federal lands and the resources under those lands.
""The 3030 program, if implemented, is likely to cause significant harm to the economy of Moffat County, and injure the county's businesses and its citizens by depriving them of access to public
lands and national forest system lands and preventing the productive use of these lands' resources,"" the resolution said.
One Colorado county the American Stewards group has been wooing is still on the fence because of a delicate-balance quandary. The Mesa County commissioners are holding off as they wait and see about another public land-impacting matter: the future of the location of the Bureau of Land Management's national headquarters, which was relocated to Grand Junction last summer.
New Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland expressed her opposition to that move in her former role as a U.S. representative from New Mexico's 1st Congressional District. The commissioners fear that coming out in opposition to the 3030 initiative that Haaland supports might tip the BLM headquarters decision out of their favor.
""We are waiting with some trepidation as to what that report is going to look like. We also want to make sure the BLM is going to stay here,"" said Mesa County Commissioner Cody Davis, a Republican who was elected in November. ""We don't really know at this point what 3030 is going to mean.""
The American Stewards group has made other headway in Colorado, where 36% of the land is owned by the federal government. Montezuma County is listed as ""in progress"" for passing an anti-3030 resolution, along with a dozen counties in Kansas and Nebraska.
The Associated Governments of Western Colorado has passed an opposition resolution, and Republican U.S. Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado's 3rd District and Doug Lamborn of the 5th District have signed a letter with 60 other federal lawmakers in the Congressional Western Caucus outlining a litany of concerns about the initiative.
On the other side of the battle
Supporters of 3030, including the Center for Western Priorities, the Western Leaders Network, the Colorado Wildlands Project and the Cattleman's Agricultural Land T rust, are not carrying out a county-by-county campaign like the opponents. They have floated their own proposal and are stating what they hope the initiative will contain when a proposal is finalized.
""We are looking at conserving lands we already have,"" said Jesse Prentice Dunn, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities. ""We are looking at voluntary conservation easements and expanding national monuments. There is no discussion about purchasing new lands or turning private lands public.""
Scott Braden, director of the Colorado Wildlands Project, pointed out that only 8% of the 8.3 million BLM acres in Western Colorado currently are conserved. He said he would like to see more of those public lands under conservation easements  and more of that conservation guided by local input, not stymied by ""a group from Texas making wild claims.""
While this battle is waged, Colorado already has a legislative proposal that is meant to get a jump on Biden's 3030 initiative.
The ""Colorado Pathways to 3030"" proposal from the consortium of conservation groups advocates for protection of about 20 million acres in the state by 2030 and is designed to be an example for other states. Since statehood, Colorado has protected 6 million acres.
Among the strategies is a public lands package introduced in the House by U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Denver, and passed in February that covers almost 3 million acres, mostly in Colorado, California, Washington and Arizona.
That bill illuminated an ideological split that was evident as the congressional delegation from Colorado debated the measure on the House floor. The legislation encompassed eight land protection bills, including two from DeGette and Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Boulder, that would affect more than 1 million acres of public lands in Colorado.
""At the end of the day, we have an obligation to leave our environment better than we found it. That's what this bill is all about,"" Neguse said in February.
But Boebert, R-Silt, said the bill ""targets"" her district and was opposed by the Colorado Farm Bureau and numerous local officials ""because of the damage they know that it will cause and the activities it will prevent.""
Lamborn, R-Colorado Springs, said he knew the intent of supporters was to protect the land, but in practice, the wilderness designation is too restrictive, preventing people from even using bicycles or strollers. ""I prefer public lands with many uses,"" he said.
He also voiced concerns that the greater land-use restrictions would halt forest management practices that can reduce fire risks, though supporters of the bill say the secretary of agriculture has the authority in wilderness areas to take measures necessary to control fire, insects and disease.
""We are going to see bigger and hotter fires in Colorado than ever before,"" Lamborn said.
Neither Lamborn nor Boebert returned calls requesting comment about 3030.
Barnstorming with a message
The American Stewards of Liberty, based in Georgetown, Texas, is continuing to barnstorm Colorado and other Western states in a concerted effort to convince more local officials and their constituents to oppose 3030.
The organization's ""Guide to Fight"" for counties says the initiative is being advanced by ""radical environmental activists."" The guide, which features an empty landscape under a menacing dark sky on its cover, calls 3030 ""an unconstitutional policy shift, moving us from a nation founded on private property principles to one controlled by the administrative state.""
""I think this group is going around projecting fears about what is unknown,"" said Braden with the Colorado Wildlands Project. ""They are turning this into a bogeyman and ginning up conflict. Biden's climate order takes great pains to say that they will work with state and local governments on
this.""
Margaret Byfield, the founder of the American Stewards, responded that she does not believe federal-local cooperation will be part of 3030.
""The federal government resists coordinating with local governments,"" she said. ""Federal agencies should be working closely with local governments because local governments have knowledge about how local lands should be managed. But they (federal officials) aren't.""
Byfield has been holding ""training sessions"" around the West and Midwest where public lands are expansive and agriculture represents a big chunk of land use. The sessions are designed to teach officials and citizens how to oppose the measure.
Byfield responded to The Colorado Sun during an airport layover as she was traveling between training sessions in South Dakota and Montana.
For two days in early May, she has training sessions scheduled in Cortez, in Montezuma County, with the sponsorship of the Colorado Livestock Association. She said the sessions will be geared toward teaching locals what their rights are when it comes to land-use decisions in their jurisdictions. In her view, the local jurisdictions have rights the federal government is trampling on.
""The 3030 policy is a policy about control,"" she said. ""It is anti-capitalism. It is anti-individual liberty. It is anti-American.""
Dueling charges of radicalism
Land conservationists aren't just on the opposite side of the fence from Byfield and the American Stewards. While Byfield calls the land conservation sector radical, they complain that the true radicals in this land battle are in her camp
Byfield is the daughter of Wayne and Jean Hage, who were part of the original Sagebrush Rebellion in the 1990s. The Hages battled the federal government then, grazing their cattle on public lands without a permit well before Cliven Bundy's armed confrontation in Nevada in 2014. The Hages' cattle were later confiscated by federal land managers and a back-and-forth court battle strung out until 2017.
Other anti-3030 activists with the American Stewards of Liberty have questioned the legitimacy of the last presidential election, the seriousness of COVID-19 and the validity of climate change. At least one of them has ties to former President Donald T rump.
The group has received funding from conservative ""dark money"" billionaires, including the Koch brothers and the DeVos family. The DonorsT rust and Donors Capital Fund, which serves as a conduit for political donors like the Kochs and DeVoses, donated $170,000 to the American Stewards of Liberty between 2015 and 2019.
T rent Loos, a Nebraska radio show host who sat on a T rump administration agricultural advisory team and is now part of the American Stewards for Liberty anti-3030 campaign, has opined that
Hitler and Nazism gave birth to the ecology movement. When asked directly, Byfield did not reject that connection.
Loos was photographed in 2016 with Ammon Bundy at the Malheur Refuge standoff in Oregon where he went to interview Ammon Bundy. During that interview, Loos blamed the federal government for the 40-day standoff  not those who took over the refuge.
The American Stewards' group initially formed as a nonprofit educational organization in 1992 through the merger of two other libertarian-leaning groups. The American Land Foundation, created as a real estate agency by the Farm Credit Bank of Texas, and the Stewards of the Range, founded by Western ranchers to support the legal battle waged by Byfield's parents, came together to become the American Stewards of Liberty.
Opposite aims, similar tactics
Gwen Lachelt, a former La Plata County commissioner who founded the Western Leaders Network and who had been working on conservation issues before 3030 became a politically-charged campaign, has taken to using similar methods as the American Stewards to generate support for the initiative.
Like the American Stewards, she has created a model resolution of support that any county or community can pass. Boulder, Gilpin, San Miguel and La Plata counties and the town of Telluride have passed her group's resolution. Like the American Stewards, Lachelt also has disseminated a ""toolkit"" of information and talking points for those inclined to proselytize about the benefits of 3030.
Lachelt said she views the initiative as simply an extension of movements already underway, including the CORE Act and the permanent protection of Wilderness Study Areas that have been awaiting action in Colorado for years.
The pro- and anti-3030 factions might share some tactics in this battle, but neither side anticipates any meeting of the minds on the details of the initiative.
""They tell us that we as independents can't make decisions about our land. That is un-American,"" Byfield said when asked if she envisioned working together with conservationists to hone details of 3030.
""I find their positions alarming and frankly really extreme,"" Lachelt said. ""I am fearful this opposition to 3030 just wants to stay pitted against rational dialogue.""
That is a shame in her estimation. ""This could be a big moment for climate change,"" she said.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is a supporter of the 3030 concept, and a spokesperson for his office wrote in an email thathe is encouraging the Biden administration to take a lesson from broadly supported, locally-led conservation efforts in Colorado.
He is encouraging the administration to reach out to ranchers, hunters and anglers, and local
elected leaders who worked for over a decade to draft the CORE Act, which would protect about 400,000 acres of public land in Colorado, establish new wilderness areas and safeguard existing outdoor recreation opportunities. He also thinks there is something to learn from private landowners maintaining critical wildlife habitat on their working lands.
Bennet, his spokesperson said, believes, if 3030 is done right, pursuing the goals of the initiative will do more than combat climate change. It will also ""grow local economies, and increase community resilience.""

Our_Future_on_Fire__Sky-Hi_News_Granby_CO___March_12_2021.txt,"O ur Future o n Fire - Sky-Hi Ne ws (Granby, CO ) - M arch 12, 2021
March 12, 2021  Sky-Hi News (Granby, CO)  Scott Condon For the Aspen Times Weekly
Colorado's 2020-wildfireseason provided a glimpse at what climate change has wrought and it is an unsettling view.
The Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires provided a devastating one-two punch to northern Colorado and became the two most destructive wildfires in the state's history late last summer and fall.
On the West Slope, the Pine Gulch Fire north of Grand Junction was temporarily the state's recordsetter after burning more than 139,000 acres in August and September.
Closer to home, the Grizzly Creek Fire wasn't on the scale of those blazes but presented extraordinary threats to infrastructure in Glenwood Canyon. Interstate 70 was shut down for two weeks. There were disruptions to railroad service and threats the city of Glenwood Springs water supply. The economy of the region took a hit at a time already made challenging by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now there are big questions for Glenwood Canyon in the fire's aftermath (see related story).
Colorado's forests were once regarded as more fireproof than those in the northern Rockies and California due to high elevations and generally wet conditions. But the 2002 drought and devastating fire conditions proved Colorado wasn't invulnerable and foreshadowed conditions to come. The drought was one of the most severe in Colorado's history. Ithelped the spread of the Hayman Creek Fire , which covered narly 138,000 acres and destroyed 133 residences. It was the state's largest wildfire until 2020.
Closer to home, the Roaring Fork Valley suffered an eye-opening threat with the Lake Christine Fire in 2018.
Philip Higuera, an associate professor and wildfire researcher at the University of Montana, said 2020 is a sign that we must adapt.
""Years like 2020 will be more common,"" he said. ""That's almost certain.
""Very broadly, it is clear with climate change over the last several decades and in particular in the 21st century, all forests throughout the West generally and in Colorado are becoming more flammable because of climate and because summers are becoming warming and drier,"" Higuera said.
In a March 4 virtual presentation for the Wilderness Workshop-Aspen Center for Environmental Studies' Naturalist Nights series and in a separate interview with The Aspen T imes, Higuera discussed whathe has learned as director of the PaleoEcology Lab and Fire Ecology Lab at the University of Montana. He has studied natural clues to wildfire activity over the last 6,000 years in the area that now encompasses Rocky Mountain National Park, so he is uniquely capable of
putting current times into perspective.
""What I've been saying is 2020 kind of punctuates this trend we've been seeing over the last several decades,"" Higuera said.
Those trends include a warmer and drier climate, increasing fire activity and growing prevalence of humans in fire -prone landscapes.
""Here's the kicker for me and what's been most surprising about 2020 -- in some sense it seems like 2020 in combination with the rest of the 21st century is kicking these high elevation subalpine forests into territory they haven't been in in recent millennia,"" he said.
One way that Higuera and his colleagues study wildfire history is by collecting and examining sediment in high altitude lakes. Preserved pine needles help them determine the dominant species of trees during various eras. Ash layers help determine periods of wildfire.
There was a warm period from about 800 to 1,000 AD that accommodated high wildfire activity, though not as high as it has been recently. Averaging out the variability in the past, subalpine forests were experiencing wildfire about once every 200 years, according to Higuera.
That's changing. We're now in uncharted territory.
""Really to my surprise, what we've found is the 21st century is kicking this area outside of the historical range of variability,"" he said. ""This is the fire rotation period now -- 112 years. Basically it means we're burning at about twice the rate that these forests have experienced in the past. If we zoom into the last decade, it's even more extreme.
""Rocky Mountain subalpine forests now appear to be burning more than any time in the past millennia,"" he continued. ""That is something that kind of had been predicted, but it's happening earlier than we thought. The impacts of climate change are upon us sooner than we thought.""
Wildfires are also tending to be more destructive. Within a fire boundary, there is typically a mosaic of activity. There are some areas of intense fire severity, where vegetation is nearly all burned up, and areas of moderate and low severity. In general, Higuera said, there are now more fires with more intense burning. He noted with a degree of amazement that the East Troublesome Fire jumped the Continental Divide at 12,000 feet in Rocky Mountain National Park last year.
The history of fire suppression in the U.S. since the early 1900s hasn'thelped the situation.
The U.S. Forest Service followed a policy for decades of snuffing every wildfire. That stopped a process that benefited forests by encouraging regeneration and age diversity of trees. Fire suppression created a heavy buildup of fuels. Add drier conditions and more human presence, and it is a recipe for disaster.
Higuera said forest ecosystems have proven remarkably resilient in the past. Natural regeneration followed fires and led to healthy forests dominated by Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir trees.
Now, it's uncertain forests will bounce back in a warmer, drier world. Forests might be thinner. T ree species might change. Aspen trees might be more dominant, assuming there is enough precipitation to allow them to flourish.
In some ways, Higuera said, the mold is set.
""Some of this increase in flammability, we're going to be living with it for years or decades to come,"" he said.
Buthe also sees these circumstances as an important call to action. He said the current conditions make him more worried for the human community than the non-human ecosystems. The ecosystems adapt.
""I think the more pressing challenge short-term is to figure out how we live in the high country -- places like Grand Lake and Aspen and all these communities that are tucked into subalpine and lower elevation forests that are quite flammable,"" Higuera said.
All told, about 7.4 million acres burned throughout the West in 2020. An estimated 10,000 structures were damaged or destroyed. Higuera said researchers have concluded that about onehalf of that acreage would have burned naturally from causes such as lightning strikes. About onehalf was due to human activity, from ignition and climate change.
Humanity needs to take climate change seriously and act on a global scale, he said. On the local level, people living in and adjacent to forests need to take wildfire protection planning seriously. That means incorporating rather than opposing fuel reduction projects.
""Recognize that a do-nothing option is not really a great, viable option for moving forward,"" Higuera said. ""That can make some people uncomfortable who really love forests and love trees and don't want to see trees removed from forests in fuel reduction efforts.
""It kind of comes down to, if we want to live in these flammable landscapes, we need to accept that they're going to be transformed,"" Higuera continued. ""They're going to be transformed with or without us participating.""
AFT ER T HE FLAMES, WILDFIRE RISKS PERSIST
Flames aren't the only problem created by wildfires.
After a record-breaking wildfireseason, Colorado now faces the aftermath in the burn scars. Mother Nature will determine the severity of events such as mudslides, debris flows and flash floods in 2021 and into coming years.
In Glenwood Canyon, the U.S. Forest Service and Colorado Department of Transportation are gauging the potential for problems such as the closure of Interstate 70 and popular recreational amenities such as the Glenwood Canyon bicycle path and Hanging Lake Trail.
The fire burned up steep slopes, charring the vegetation that anchored rocks and dirt in place. The canyon was already notorious for rockfall. Now the risk is magnified, according to Steve Hunter, a former engineer with the White River National Forest and a member of its Burned Area Emergency Response team.
The BAER team's assessment showed that 12 percent of the terrain within the perimeter of the fire suffered a high level of burn severity, 43 percent was moderate, 33 percent was low and 12 percent was unburned.
The Forest Service started with emergency repairs to trails and roads last fall and will continue as weather allows this spring. Partner agencies are installing rain gauges to help with forecasts for flooding and debris flows.
Despite the precautions, an extended downpour could result in trouble for Interstate 70, the railroad line, the Glenwood Springs water supply and numerous recreational amenities.
The Grizzly Creek Fire topped out at 32,631 acres. The potential for problems is magnified by the Colorado mega-fires of 2020. The East Troublesome Fire covered 193,812 acres, originating north-northeast of Kremmling.
To the east of that fire, across the Continental Divide, the Cameron Peak Fire topped out at 208,913 acres, 25 miles east of Walden and 15 miles southwest of Red Feather Lakes.

The three largest wildfires in the history of Colorado occurred in 2020. They were:
Cameron Peak Fire208,913 acres

Human beings have a tendency to be afraid of new things; just ask any parent how hard it is to get small children to try different foods. The word for an extreme fear of anything new  neophobia  is, in fact, most often applied to children's fear of new foods.
In some ways we never entirely grow out of neophobia. These days, our collective natural tendency toward neophobia is enhanced by extreme political polarization and what the author Svetlana Boym calls ""restorative nostalgia,"" some people's desire to return to an idealized past rather than face the future.
It's an idea that doesn't work. We can't erase technology in order to ease its ill effects and continue to function as a society, for example.
Nor can we pretend that our former ways of addressing the threat of wildfire are adequate to our times.
These days, almost everyone who talks about wildfire (and surely that's almost everyone who lives in the West, or at least anywhere in the West a major fire has wreaked havoc) talks in terms of ""when,"" not if, the next big fire comes  just as California's top meme is anticipation of ""the big one,"" meaning the earthquake that will redraw that state's coastal map.
But while scientists haven't yet figured out how to prevent earthquakes, they have figured out quite a bit about preventing and mitigating wildfire threat. Unfortunately, our efforts of the past are inadequate for today.
Long-term drought and other impacts of climate change have exacerbated wildfire threathere in Southwest Colorado. The individual firefighters and agencies that work to keep us and our homes, businesses, agricultural assets, watersheds and landscapes safe from destruction are overtaxed and cannot meet this growing challenge.
A new initiative called Southwest Wildfire Impact Fund is being considered by the La Plata County Board of County Commissioners and Durango City Council. Those involved in developing the comprehensive SWIF plan received major grant funding and have spent two long years analyzing and strategizing what can be done to improve our chances of fighting off fire.
The basic problems are these: Funding for preventing and mitigating wildfire threats is inconsistent and short-term; efforts aren't conducted across geopolitical boundaries, which fire doesn't respect; previous efforts have focused on suppression to the exclusion of overall foresthealth management; and prevention has focused on public lands, while private landowners haven't been able to duplicate those efforts  and fire doesn't see those boundaries, either.
A comprehensive, cross-boundary, scientific approach to addressing the fire threat is required if we are to avoid another 416 Fire or worse.
Barbara Noseworthy and Melissa Youssef of City Council and Commissioner Marsha PorterNorton comprise the study group that will examine SWIF and make recommendations to their respective bodies.
Much more detail will be discussed about SWIF in the coming months. It will have its naysayers. But we hope all of us can overcome our natural neophobia and engage in the process of determining whether SWIF, or some variation thereof, is the right path.
Our lives and our future may depend on it.

DENVER (AP) -- A few years ago, the U.S. Forest Service sat down with Eagle County officials and delivered some bad news: The federal agency was short-staffed and would be closing campgrounds in the mountainous county that includes Vail, where outdoor recreation is king.
Eagle County responded by spending its own tax dollars to pay USFS employees, an unusual arrangement that has become commonplace in Colorado's high country, where waves of tourists have poured into some of the most-visited forests in the nation.
""It has rubbed some within the community the wrong way because it's a federal property and they should manage it with federal money,"" Eagle County Commissioner Jeanne McQueeney said. ""But if that money is not allocated then they manage it by closing. They don't have the people.""
Colorado's ski areas send about $25 million a year in fees to the federal treasury in exchange for being on federal land, and only a small fraction returns to those forests for management. That is a frustrating contrast for ski companies that can't get expansions and upgrades approved in a timely way and for local governments that must maintain the forests or lose their economies' golden goose.
""Why is that money being generated here and then taken to Washington and thrown into the treasury,"" Breckenridge Mayor Eric Mamula said, ""instead of being allocated for things that are needed in the forests?""
Coloradans in Congress from both political parties have sought a solution for several years but nothing has made its way to a president's desk yet. The latest bill has the support of Colorado's two U.S. senators, as well as Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse and Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, who together represent all of the high country.
Neguse calls the current arrangement ""outrageous,"" saying the Forest Service ""has been unable or unwilling to invest the necessary resources to do the work they are obligated to do under federal law.""
-- ""A lot to handle""
White River National Forest , which spans nine counties and a dozen ski areas across northwest Colorado, is the most popular forest in the U.S. In 2008, its Eagle-Holy Cross ranger district in Eagle County had seven full-time employees on front country management -- permitting, interacting with visitors, maintaining facilities.
A decade later, in 2018, it had one, according to the Northwest Colorado Council of Governments.
""That's a lot of forest for one guy,"" said Jon Stavney, the council's executive director, ""You
wouldn't run a sheriff's department that way."" His organization sent a letter to Congress in 2018 warning of the shortage and urging action.
Ski areas saw the problem first. For those 122 nationwide that reside on federal land, changes to slopes must be approved by the U.S. Forest Service, which studies their environmental impact. But the years-long delays mean ""ski areas are slow to upgrade critical infrastructure,"" Alan Henceroth, chief operating officer at Arapahoe Basin, recently told a congressional panel.
By 2018, mountain counties realized the problem was beyond the ski areas: Rangers were tasked with overseeing massive stretches of land, making it difficult for them to put out all the campfires left burning.
Summit County voters created a fund in 2018 that is used for wildfire mitigation and ranger work. Summit and Eagle counties also created front country ranger programs -- partnerships between the counties and the forest service to add patrols in the White River National Forest at the expense of county taxpayers.
Since 2019, Eagle County and its towns have spent $387,000 on front country rangers, according to a county spokeswoman. In 2020, when the coronavirus had many people seeking outdoor fun, those rangers extinguished 32 fires and hauled out 5,000 pounds of garbage, along with human and dog waste, abandoned RVs and illegal campsites.
""People come here, want to access our trails and fourteeners, and they're overrun with people. They need management. The parking needs management. The trails need management. It's a lot to handle,"" McQueeney said. ""We're happy to do it, but we do hear pushback: Is that really our role?' So far, every year, we've managed to say, Yes, it is' and our constituents are agreeing with us.""
Summit County Commissioner Elisabeth Lawrence calls the unusual arrangement an ""insurance policy"" for her tourism-dependent county, which includes Breckenridge, ""because if some huge wildfire takes out Summit County, the economic impact would be devastating for generations to come.""
-- ""A little more perfect""
Earlier this month, the Ski Hill Resources for Economic Development Act, or SHRED Act, debuted in Congress. Forests that account for more than $15 million in ski fees -- such as White River -- could spend 60% of it on staffing, trail improvements and other ranger work. Those that take in less than $15 million per year, including Colorado's nine other national forests, would keep 75%.
The bill's odds appear good: It has bipartisan support in both the House, where two Democrats and two Republicans introduced it, as well as in the Senate, where it's sponsored by Democratic
Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado and Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, will support the bill with a few technical changes, according to Jennifer Eberlien, associate deputy chief of the National Forest System. And no opposition was voiced during a recent two-hour House hearing.
(The hearing briefly attracted national attention when Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert asked Eberlein whether the forest service can shift the moon's orbit and the Earth's orbit to combat climate change. Eberlein said she would have to get back to Gohmert.)
Neguse, who chaired the hearing, expects the bill will be amended sometime this summer before going to the full House for a vote.
When asked why the forest service is underfunded, Neguse said ""administration after administration in Washington, on both sides of the aisle, (have been) neglecting the agency."" Because the vast majority of national forests are in the West, ""it can be a bit difficult for the appropriators in Washington ... to fully appreciate the scope of the need,"" he added.
For the high country mayors, commissioners and county managers who have felt required to spend their constituents' tax dollars maintaining federal forests, the SHRED Act is a welcome alternative to the strange arrangement they've put up with for several years.
""In a perfect world, this wouldn't be happening,"" McQueeney said, ""and maybe this bill will make it a little more perfect.""

Over_460_structures_impacted_by_Cameron_Peak_Fire__Daily_Reporter-Herald_The_Loveland_CO___November_7_2020.txt,"O ve r 460 structure s imp acte d by Cameron Peak Fire - Daily Re p o rte r-He rald, The (Lo ve land, CO ) No ve mbe r 7, 2020
November 7, 2020  Daily Reporter-Herald, The (Loveland, CO)  Austin Fleskes
The Larimer County Sheriff's Office released a report Friday afternoon on the structure damage caused by the Cameron Peak Fire .
The Larimer County Damage Assessment Team has completed assessments of all known structure damage caused by the fire.
The team found that 469 structures were affected by the fire. The breakdown of the damage includes:
* 461 structures destroyed (residential and outbuildings).
* 224 residential structures were destroyed and four sustained damage; 42 of them were primary residences.
* 20 outbuildings were destroyed and four sustained damage.
* 17 business structures were impacted (at Shambhala Mountain Center).
The assessment also listed dates when the damage took place at various locations, which included:
* Sept. 7  Poudre Canyon south of Colo. 14 near Archer's Poudre River Resort and the Monument Gulch area.
* Sept. 25 and 26  Poudre Canyon between the Fish Hatchery and Rustic, the Manhattan Road area, and the Boy Scout Ranch Road area.
* Oct. 14  Upper and Lower Buckhorn areas, Crystal Mountain, Bobcat Ridge, Buckskin Heights, Redstone Canyon, Storm Mountain, The Retreat, and Pingree Park.
""As the community comes together to support those who suffered property loss, we stand with them,"" Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said in the release. ""We feel the pain of being displaced and not having a home to go back to. In the midst of this hurt, I am so proud of the deputies, firefighters, and a variety of other officers from many law enforcement agencies who heroically evacuated thousands and thousands of people and made sure that no one felt the pain of losing a loved one to this fire. It was an amazing effort, and I am thankful.""
The team added that there may be other structures affected that the assessor's office was not aware of and ""therefore were not assessed.""
The team also was unable to find contact information for owners of all properties with confirmed
damag e.
The Cameron Peak Fire has remained at the same acreage and containment level over the last several days, having burned 208,913 acres and standing at 92% containment.
The East Troublesome T hompson Zone spot fire in Rocky Mountain National Park has also remained the same size and containment level -- 4,889 acres and 48% containment.
In a Facebook update Friday night, incident commander Rob Allen said he expected containment numbers to increase soon, but so far snow or steep, rocky conditions have prevented firefighters from accessing some areas to be able to check for containment.
Fire managers said their work has shifted to repairing damage along about 110 miles of fire line.
Also in the update, Rocky Mountain National Park Superintendent Darla Sidles said most of the access points on the east side of the park have reopened, but the U.S. 36 entrance and Bear Lake Road remain closed for the foreseeable future.
U.S. Forest Service spokesman Vern Koehler said some forest areas may reopen on Sunday, but others will remain closed. He said people can check the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests website or social media on Saturday for updates.
He also asked people to remember a fire ban is still in place on the forest land.

Pandemic_restrictions_will_complicate_potentially__Denver_Post_The_CO___May_18_2020__p9A.txt,"Pande mic re strictio ns will co mp licate p o te ntially - De nve r Po st, The (CO ) - May 18, 2020 - p age 9A
DURANGO As if Southwest Colorado's extreme drought wasn't enough to raise concerns about a potentially destructive wildfireseason, the added complications of the coronavirus have only fueled that anxiety.
The COVID-19 outbreak demands people isolate as much as possible to reduce the spread of the virus, but a typical wildfire response requires firefighters to work in close contact, under stressful conditions and in the presence of hazardous smoke.
In sum, things people should not be doing amid a global pandemic.
So how, exactly, are emergency personnel going to navigate this harrowing juxtaposition, along with other challenges that come with the coronavirus outbreak, should a large wildfire ignite?
""I think that all of us in the fire service, nationwide, are concerned what it's going to look like if we get a major event going,"" Hal Doughty, chief of Durango Fire Protection District, said recently.
""But some community, somewhere, is going to draw the unlucky card and have the big fire of the year. And we need to figure out what we need to do to keep firefighters and the community safe,"" he said.
Conditions in region are already dry
The risk for a major fire breaking out right now is high.
From October to April, the region saw just 70% of its average precipitation levels. This winter, the ground in the high country froze before snow arrived and was not able to absorb moisture. Lower elevations barely received any snowpack.
More recently, spring has been all but devoid of moisture. Unusually high temperatures have caused snowpack to melt earlier than normal. And soils are incredibly dry, a sign that fuels on the ground are ripe to burn.
""Unless we get some precipitation, we're going to be fighting a lot of fires,"" said Butch Knowlton, director of La Plata County's Office of Emergency Management.
La Plata County recently entered Stage 1 fire restrictions.
Virus delays planning efforts
The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment for this story. However, at a La Plata County meeting last week, Richard Bustamante, fire manager for the San Juan National Forest , said the coronavirus outbreak delayed and complicated planning efforts for the upcoming
wildfireseason.
In recent weeks, the Forest Service has enacted fire restrictions and started to mobilize its wildfire response teams. But should a fire break out, the risk to firefighters remains a top concern.
""As much as we want to have a normal response to any new starts ... it's going to be harder this year,"" Bustamante said.
Firefighters work side-by-side digging fire lines or back burning. They eat together, and sleep in large encampments. While typically made up of young people, fire crews endure significant stress, poor sleep and hygiene, and inhale dangerous smoke and dust.
Bustamante said the Forest Service held virtual trainings in recent weeks to limit human interactions and had crews quarantine before coming on. As of Tuesday, he said there were no reported positive cases of COVID-19 in the ranks.
""It's not just everyone in tight quarters looking over a map like it used to be,"" he said. ""People are separating .""
Federal guidelines released earlier this month recommend fire managers use small crews to limit widespread close contact among firefighters, and these crews should stay away from other large groups. The guidelines also recommend avoiding traditional large camps and say everyone should wear masks and other protective equipment when around those outside their immediate crew.
Keeping fires at bay
One of the main concerns is a major fire breaking out that requires assistance from firefighters across the country.
""We don't want anything to grow in size where we need outside resources,"" Knowlton said.
John Lee, chief of Fort Lewis Mesa Fire Protection District, said last week La Plata County's four fire districts have been in close contact to coordinate mutual aid, given this potential complication.
""Our resources are a little thinner on the federal side right now,"" he said.
Knowlton added La Plata County Road and Bridge Department crews are supplying big water trucks so fire districts can concentrate on fighting fires and not worry about securing water to douse a blaze.
And this year, Bustamante said, the Forest Service is in full-suppression mode.
In recent years, the Forest Service has been using wildfire as a means of better managing the landscape, allowing blazes to burn to mimic when fires were part of the forest 's natural cycle.
But now, even though it would be hard to keep any fire under relative control given the dry conditions, Bustamante said COVID-19 poses additional risk, not just to firefighters, but also to the
general public.
""COVID-19 is a respiratory issue, and smoke in the air does nothelp,"" he said. ""Does that mean we'll catch everything? No. But we'll give it our best effort, absolutely.""
Avoiding the worst
La Plata County's Knowlton said managing evacuations and evacuation shelters are yet another challeng e.
During past fires that required evacuations, very few people needed an emergency shelter, staying instead with family and friends. But with the COVID-19 outbreak, people may be less willing to house evacuees.
""It's something we all have to think about,"" Knowlton said. ""Maybe we put people in hotel rooms. It's a case-by-case scenario.""

Parks Service Forest Service and Montrose County lift fire.txt,"Parks Service, Forest Service and Montrose County lift fire
restrictions

Fire restrictions on the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests (the GMUG) have been rescinded, as have fire restrictions at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park and Curecanti National Recreation Area.
Fire restrictions for unincorporated Montrose County also were to be lifted starting Friday morning, July All three entities cited recent rains that have bumped up fuel moisture and cut the fire danger a bit  but people still need to be cautious with fire.
""Even though fire restrictions have been lifted in part of the county, I am strongly urging community members to use caution when burning. Please make sure to have water and shovels readily available when burning and always call dispatch at 970-249-9110 before burning,"" said Sheriff Gene Lillard. ""This year continues to be a challenge for firefighters and firefighting resources across the nation and I want the public to be mindful of limited resources available due to major fires in both Colorado and the western U.S.""
The county's decision on fire restrictions does not apply to municipalities within Montrose County, which may have their own rules in effect.
As is always the case at Black Canyon and Curecanti, campfires are restricted to fire rings in established campground and picnic areas. Beach fires are allowed on the shores of Blue Mesa Reservoir. Please exercise extreme caution; keep flame length low and be sure that all fires are out and cool to the touch. In high winds, burning debris from your campfire can start fires well downwind. When the wind comes up, your campfire should go down and out.
On the GMUG, campfires are allowed outside of established campgrounds and recreation sites, but adjoining federal or county lands may be under fire restrictions still, and it is the responsibility of visitors Public lands managers remind people that, as conditions warrant, fire restrictions may be reimposed. It is vital to practice smart wildfire prevention behavior including never leaving a campfire unattended, using established campfire rings, picking safe and proper campfire sites and ensuring that their fires are completely out and cool to the touch by using the drown, stir and feel methods.
Even an accidental fire start can result in the individual being held responsible including fines and/or jail to prevent wildfire. To learn more about campfire safety visit www.smokeybear.com.

ST EAMBOAT SPRINGS -- The Middle Fork Fire was measured at 16,120 acres as of Friday morning, marking a 4,128-acre increase since Thursday.
Thursday's weather conditions pushed the fire mostly southeast and northwest, as the report states. Fire behavior is currently described as extreme, with fire moving through the crowns of trees and spotting, which is when sparks or embers are carried by the wind and start new fires beyond the zone of direct ignition.
While the fire is pushing closer to the Seedhouse Campground area, authorities said there are currently no plans for pre-evacuation orders. If the fire were to reach any pre-evacuation points, the Routt County Sheriff's Office would alert residents with ""plenty of time,"" said Jesse McCarty, spokesperson for the Middle Fork Fire command.
Firefighters are monitoring the fire from all ends, but the top priority, McCarty said, is the southern portion of the fire.
""People should not be panicked or even of high concern because of the plans we're executing,"" he said. ""The community is very safe.""
An incoming cold front is driving winds Friday and Saturday, with cooler weather on Sunday and the possibility of precipitation. T emperatures are projected above normal through the extended forecasted with low relative humidities.

Phase 1 of fire mitigation work at SkyRidge Open Space, which includes an area along Powerline Trail in the SkyRidge portion of Horse Gulch, is complete.
The city of Durango's Parks and Recreation Department formed the Fire Adapted Durango Partnership with Durango Fire Protection District, Colorado State Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, La Plata County, Wildfire Adapted Partnership, Colorado Division of Fire Prevention & Control, San Juan National Forest and neighbors adjacent to mitigation areas. The goal of the partnership is to reduce risk of wildfire within city limits, specifically within the Wildland Urban Interface  areas where human-made improvements are built close to, or within, natural terrain and flammable vegetation.
Fire mitigation work will continue in the Wildland Urban Interface in coming years. The city will notify residents living in areas of upcoming mitigation work and engage them in the projects. Community engagement and education are critical in making Durango a fire -adapted community .
Since initiating Phase 1, some private homeowners adjacent to city open space have worked to create defensible space around their homes. The Wildfire Adapted Partnership provides education and resources to assist homeowners with this process. Homeowners can have cut vegetation hauled away during the city's Fall and Spring Cleanup events.

Pika monitoring project uses volunteers to collect scientifi.txt,"Pika monitoring project uses volunteers to collect scientific data July 5, 2021  Summit Daily News (CO)

The Colorado Pika Project on the White River National Forest is back for its fourth summer, giving local hikers the opportunity to help scientists understand the impacts of climate change on the American pika and its habitat.
American pikas are small mammals, most closely related to rabbits, that are iconic to the alpine scree fields of Colorado and the West. According to the Forest Service, recent disappearances of pika populations have been linked to changes in temperature, snowpack and vegetation.
Alex Wells, community science coordinator at the Denver Zoo and co-leader of the pika project, said scientists have yet to see pika populations decline in the state. Though, as declines have already been seen in other pika ranges, like the Great Basin in Nevada, there is a need for proactive conservation work in Colorado.
Wells said this project is important because it can get locals who are passionate about the environment directly involved in scientific efforts while simply going on a hike in their area. ""It's an awesome way for folks to contribute to the conservation of an iconic Colorado species just while doing something that they love,"" Wells said.
Wells leads the effort alongside Megan Mueller, a conservation biologist with the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Wild, who helped launch the initial project in 2010. Initially, the project had about 44 monitoring sites solely in Rocky Mountain National Park. It was started based on a model predicting that pikas would be gone from the national park by the year 2100.
Since then, the project has extended to the White River National Forest and now includes almost 200 monitoring sites across the state, Wells said.
Rocky Mountain Wild and the Denver Zoo host training sessions for those interested in volunteering each summer. Volunteers will learn how to document and look for pika signs, as well as record important environmental variables that influence pika habitats.
""We really do require folks to have a good sense of what they're doing and what they're looking for, and by far the best way to get that knowledge is to go out in the field,"" Wells said. Volunteer training sessions generally go from about 7 a.m. to noon and are available as follows:
* July 17 at Independence Pass.
* July 18 at the Colorado River Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park, north of Grand Lake.
* July 25 at the Trappers Outlet Trailhead east of Meeker.
* July 10, July 25 and Aug. 9 at Vail Pass, co-hosted by the Walking Mountains Science Center. 
Training sessions typically involve a 2-4 mile hike.
According to Wells, recordable pika signs can include actually seeing a pika, hearing a pika squeak or seeing pika droppings and hay piles. Wells said pikas don't hibernate in the winter, but instead they make a food stash or a hay pile throughout the summer that can grow to be quite large.
Volunteers are also trained to track environmental signs in pika habitats, taking note of the presence of water and vegetation that pikas can eat and the size of the rocks they're found in. Wells said this summer they are also placing tools in the field that can automatically collect information on temperatures in pika habitats.
Wells also said the team is in the process of developing a pika monitoring mobile app, which will allow volunteers  trained through the project or not  to document pika activity.
In 2020, the project did not train any new volunteers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but there were still 123 volunteers participating in research. Earlier training sessions this year have already prepared 55 new volunteers to monitor pika activity, and Wells said he hopes to reach a total of 100 new volunteers by the end of the season.
Wells said the team is just now getting to a point where it is collecting good, valuable data as it builds up its volunteer base. He said he expects to have a good estimate for the trajectory of local pika populations in the next two or three years of research.

June 3, 2021  Gazette, The (Colorado Spring s, CO)  Breeanna Jent
Outdoor industry leaders expect a boom in outdoor recreation across the Pikes Peak region this summer as the nation comes out of the pandemic. But they're concerned about the toll increased usage of local parks, trails and open spaces could take on the environment, particularly without sufficient funds to combat it, they told U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) Thursday.
As local coalitions come together to mitigate wildfire danger, restore watersheds and maintain parks and open spaces across the region, they face challenges when it comes to funding and mitigation planning, Pikes Peak Outdoor Recreation Alliance members said during a meeting with the senator at Bear Creek Regional Park in Colorado Springs.
""Our challenge here (is that we have) almost too much of a good thing,"" said Susan Davies, executive director of the Trails and Open Space Coalition and a member of the alliance. ""We have so many beautiful places to hike, to explore, where we can recreate. Everybody out there wants what we have, so they're coming from Kansas and Oklahoma and Texas. I think, once again, we're going to see record numbers this summer, which is great for the economy. But it does take its toll on the environment.""
With more federal funding, outdoor recreation organizations could better mitigate environmental hazards and take some of the strain off the national Forest Service, which is understaffed and until recently was forced to use more than half of its budget to fund the cost of fighting wildfires rather than mitigation, Bennet said.
He discussed how his bipartisan Outdoor Restoration Partnership Act could help. Co-sponsored by U.S. Reps. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) and Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) and included in President Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, the bill would create millions of jobs in forest and watershed restoration projects across the country, lowering the risk of catastrophic wildfire to protect Colorado's watersheds and boost the economy, Bennet said.
""There's been such a profound underinvestment in our national forests for so many decades,"" he said. ""With climate change we see the devastation that is occurring because of the wildfires that we're having. Their duration, their intensity is nothing like we've seen before.""
Bennet's $60 billion bill would provide funds to federal and local agencies to collaborate on mitigation projects rather than ""paying the incredibly expensive cost"" of fighting fires across the state, he said. It costs about $1,500 -- a figure outdoor industry leaders said Thursday was likely conservative -- to treat an acre of national forest , but $50,000 to fight a fire on that same acre, Bennet said.
""Fire doesn't know any political jurisdiction and it needs all this cooperating together to get the work done,"" he said.
While $60 billion is a significant amount of money, it's what is needed for the country to catch up
on a decades-long backlog of fire mitigation and watershed restoration projects, Bennet said. It's also about the same amount of money spent every four or five years to fight the wildfires, he said.
Wildfire mitigation in national forests requires a ""proper investment"" from the federal government, he added. National forests are critical infrastructure just as freeways and tunnels are, and when forests are damaged or degraded everyone is affected, he said.
""Everybody who's downstream from Colorado needs to care about this, and there are a lot of people downstream from Colorado,"" Bennet said.
While Pikes Peak Outdoor Recreation Alliance members applauded the bill, they were concerned that it does not fund treatment of roadless areas or wilderness.
""That's a concern to many of us because so much of our wildlife and so many of our watershed and recreation assets are there. They're also the areas where many fires start,"" Pikes Peak Outdoor Recreation Alliance Executive Director Becky Leinweber said.
Additionally, sometimes federal funding has significant restrictions, including that it cannot be used to feed or house members of the organizations who are doing the mitigation work, alliance members said. Those restrictions make it difficult for mitigators to complete their work and they must come up with other sources of funding to fill in the gaps, they said.
Bennet said the feedback he received from the group was helpful, and he took notes throughout the meeting to refine the bill.
""These are bills that are not written in Washington, D.C. They're written around picnic tables like this one,"" he said.

Pitching clean energy in mud  Infrastructure bill would inve.txt,"Pitching clean energy in mud - Infrastructure bill would invest in
future

With environmental groups calling for bolder action by the Biden administration on climate change, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm visited Colorado on Thursday to promote the investments a bipartisan bill makes in clean energy and cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.
Granholm's tour with U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., of a community solar garden in Aurora comes as much of the West is confronting intense drought, record-breaking heat, historic wildfires and shrinking water supplies. Questions are increasing about the Colorado River's ability to meet the region's expanding needs.
After a drive around the 40-acre solar garden, which ended with one vehicle getting stuck in the muddy, rain-drenched site, Granholm said the bipartisan bill represents major investments in public transit and infrastructure, such as bridges.
""All of these basic fundamentals that were negotiated, we've got to get that through. And we've got to get the second step through as well, and the second step will include things like the clean energy standard, which is very, very important,"" Granholm said.
Many states, including Colorado, have standards requiring certain amounts of electricity come from renewable energy. 
""Both pieces are very important, and both pieces the president is committed to making sure get through to his desk,"" Granholm added.
Hickenlooper noted the first bill provides tens of billions of dollars for improving the electric grid. ""When we're standing outhere looking at this incredible harvesting of solar energy, we need a grid. We need a smart grid,"" Hickenlooper said.
The $973 billion, bipartisan infrastructure proposal omits other provisions for combating climate change included in President Joe Biden's original $2.3 trillion plan. Biden has said he will pursue many of the economic and environmental goals in a second bill that would be proposed through a specific budget process to get around a potential filibuster. ""This is one step. We can't let up.""
In June, several environmental organizations sent a letter to Congress saying that any infrastructure package or legislative action on the plan ""must prioritize bold, ambitious, and swift measures to tackle the climate crisis and address longstanding environmental injustices."" Alice Madden, a former Colorado House majority leader and Department of Energy official, said that although she would like to see more in the bill, ""it needs to pass.""
""This is one step. We can't let up. This is where we start to build the case for the bigger and bolder moves as soon as possible,' said Madden, executive director of Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resources, Energy, and the Environment at the University of Colorado law school.
Madden said the bill's investments in public transportation and other infrastructure will have direct impacts on people's lives by helping to create jobs and address communities disproportionately affected by pollution and the warming climate.
""One of the things that's great about the bipartisan bill that they've agreed to, at least in the framework, is a lot more money ... for transmission,"" said Mike Kruger, president and CEO of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association.
The bill also provides money for public transportation, passenger and freight rail, electric buses and charging stations for electric vehicles and $47 billion to help communities cope with disasters and severe weather caused by climate change.
But the scaled-back bill, negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, doesn't include funding for tax incentives for renewable energy, including wind and solar projects and storage of the power those produce. Kruger said renewable-energy advocates want to see the tax credits extended at 30%, given the industry's increased prices because of continuing tariffs on aluminum, steel and solar modules. The renewable-energy industry appreciates the administration's focus on increasing the use of renewable energy and cutting the emissions contributing to climate change, Kruger said. ""The Biden administration is 1,000% better than the previous administration.""
Granholm said Biden wants ""robust"" tax credits for renewable energy. The administration also is interested in investment tax credits to spur domestic production of such equipment as solar panels and batteries and funding for pilot projects to capture and sequester carbon dioxide. Solar power
Colorado's clean-energy industry employed 58,182 at the end of 2020, according to a survey by E2, or Environmental Entrepreneurs, a national industry group. Employment dropped nearly 7% during the pandemic, but it rebounded 6% from June to December last year.
The community solar garden that Granholm visited was developed by Namaste Solar of Boulder in partnership with Unico Solar Investors and Excelsior Energy Capital. Solar gardens are centralized arrays of solar panels and are alternatives for homes and businesses that don't have the space or right location for rooftop panels.
Colorado adopted the country's first statewide community solar program in 2010, but advocates say the state has lagged behind since because of limits on the size of projects and other restrictions. Recent changes to the law are intended to lift caps on the size and location of gardens to expand access to them.
Colorado was 13th in the nation for installed solar capacity, with 1,536.15 megawatts of solar energy installed as of 2020, according to the Department of Energy. One megawatt of solar energy can supply electricity to 200 to 250 homes.
Granholm also planned to attend the Colorado Rockies game at Coors Field with University of Colorado students who won this year's DOE Solar Decathlon competition.

Pitkin County moving to Stage 1 fire restrictions as dry hot.txt,"Pitkin County moving to Stage 1 fire restrictions as dry, hot weather
continues

Pitikin County is heightening its fire concerns, and starting Wednesday Stage 1 fire restrictions will be enacted, the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office announced Tuesday.
The restrictions mean no campfires in undeveloped sites, no outdoor smoking and no fireworks and cover all state, public, private, incorporated and unincorporated lands within Pitkin County, according to the Sheriff's Office news release.
""Land management officials from the U.S. Forest Service  White River National Forest and Bureau of Land Management are planning to implement their own restrictions later in the week,"" the release said. Weather forecasters and fire officials are concerned about a hot and dry summer, meaning fire danger could continue to increase and tighter restrictions could be put in place. There were red flag warnings last week in western Colorado, and the forecast for this week is hot and dry in the Colorado mountains and Western Slope. Highs in Aspen are forecast for the upper 80s into the weekend and in the upper 90s in Glenwood Springs.
Excessive heat warnings are in place this week in the Grand Junction area, where highs will break records in the triple digits, the National Weather Service forecasts.
""Triple digits will continue across many lower elevations with record highs being met or exceeded during the coming week,"" according to the NWS hazardous weather update Tuesday from the Grand Junction office. ""Precipitation chances slowly start to increase Wednesday afternoon onward with afternoon storms mainly over the high terrain. Gusty winds and lightning appear the main concerns.""
STAGE 1 RESTRICTIONS
The fire restrictions, per the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office, apply to the following persons and activities:
A. Building, maintaining, attending, or using a fire or campfire except within a developed recreation site, or improved site to include a fire ring/pit.
B. Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle, building, or area cleared of all combustible materials.
C. Operating or using an internal or external combustion engine without an approved spark-arresting device properly installed, maintained, and in effective working order meeting either the USDA Forest Service Standards or appropriate Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) recommended practices. 
D. Use of any personal fireworks or explosive requiring fuses or blasting caps, including exploding targets, as defined by Colorado Revised Statute 12-28-101(8).
The local fire restrictions are expected to grow in the coming days. Eagle County officials also announced Tuesday the county would go to Stage 1 restrictions starting Friday. The decision, made in a weekly Tuesday meeting among local and regional fire managers, comes just a day after a string of small fires broke out on the north side of Interstate 70 from Avon to Edwards.
The move to Stage 1 restrictions also means that when the county issues a red-flag warning, it automatically moves restrictions up to the next level.
Area firefighting agencies and emergency management officials were set to consider possible fire restrictions at the Tuesday meeting where the current fire conditions and available resources are to be discussed, Chris Bornholdt, emergency manager for the Garfield County Sheriff's Office, said at Monday's Garfield County Board of Commissioners meeting.
Pitkin County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo said in the news release he is hoping to reduce the likelihood of a human-caused fire with these new restrictions.
""One of the tools I have, as fire warden, is to implement fire restrictions, when the science supports it, to reduce the likelihood of a human-caused wildfire,"" he said. ""Since 90 percent of wildfires are humancaused the impacts of inaction on our part are far greater than the impact to our community and we must do everything we can to deter and prevent fires in Pitkin County.""
The fine for breaking the ban includes $500 for a first offense, $750 for a second offense, and $1,000 for a third and subsequent offense, in addition to any restitution, according to the Sheriff's Office.

Wednesday

With the continued hot, dry weather, Pitkin County is moving to Stage 2 fire restrictions starting Wednesday, Sheriff Joe DiSalvo said Tuesday in a news release.
""A Stage 2 fire restriction essentially prohibits all fires, whether you're in an established campsite or on the back deck at your house,"" DiSalvo said in the release. ""My deputies will enforce this fire restriction and will issue citations to those who violate it. We once again find ourselves in an extreme fire season. With the numerous wildfires in surrounding counties and having seen the long range weather forecast we know we must do everything we can to deter and prevent human caused fires in our community.""
The new fire restrictions start at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday and are in effect until further notice. The Stage 2 restrictions cover all state, public, private, incorporated and unincorporated lands within Pitkin County, and according to the release ""officials from the US Forest Service  White River National Forest and Bureau of Land Management are planning to implement their own restrictions later in the week.""
Those who violate these fire restrictions can face criminal penalties, which include fines of $500 (first offense), $750 (second offense), and $1,000 (third offense) and possible jail time. The Roaring Fork Valley area has been under Stage 1 restrictions since last week. For more information on the restrictions, go to www.pitkinemergency.com.
STAGE 2 RESTRICTIONS
The fire restrictions apply to the following activities, according to the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office:
 Building, maintaining, attending or using a fire, campfire, or stove fire. This includes charcoal grills and barbecues, coal and wood-burning stoves and sheepherder's stoves and includes use in developed camping and picnic grounds. (Gas grills/stoves/lanterns using pressurized liquid or gas that include shutoff valves are permitted when used in an area at least three feet or more from flammable material such as grasses or pine needles.)
 Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle, building, or area cleared of all combustible materials.
 Use of any fireworks including sparklers, rockets, exploding targets, and tracers or incendiaries.
 Using an explosive. This includes but is not limited to fuses or blasting caps.
 Welding or operating an acetylene or other torch with open flame without a current permit or letter of authorization.
 Operating or using any internal combustion engine (e.g. chainsaw, generator, ATV) without an approved spark arresting device properly installed and in effective working order meeting either:
Department of Agriculture, Forest Service Standard 5100-1a; or Appropriate Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE recommended practice J335(b) and J350(a).
Operating a chainsaw without an approved spark arresting device properly installed and in effective working order, and chemical pressurized fire extinguisher (8 oz. capacity by weight or larger and kept with the operator) and a round point shovel with an overall length of at least 35 inches that is readily available for use.
This is a developing story that will be updated.

Plan could mean protecting 14 million acres in Colorado.txt,"Plan could mean protecting 14 million acres in Colorado

President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled plans for locally-led protection of 30% of U.S. land and water by 2030, a core of his agenda to address climate warming that builds on nature-saving efforts launched in Congress by lawmakers from Colorado and other Western states.
Natural land and water could draw down the heat-trapping air pollution that causes climate change, scientists say, and nature increasingly is understood as a life support system for human survival both inside cities and in rural areas. Preserving at least 30% of land and water by 2030, they say, is necessary to pull back from a catastrophic tipping point.
Gov. Jared Polis issued a statement casting Colorado as a leader in cooperative ""science-based approaches"" toward the fulfillment of Biden's climate objectives.
Biden's announcement ""opens the door to a collaborative and sustainable path toward conserving our critical ecosystems, supporting the Colorado way of life, while closing the door to fears about broad onesize-fits-all mandates,"" Polis said. ""The West, particularly Colorado, is on the front lines of a changing
landscape and a changing climate, and yet our ties to the natural world underpin nearly every aspect of our lives and economy. We must chart an inclusive path toward the long-term sustainability of our natural world, and Colorado's leadership will play a key role in that effort."" 
Local government leaders around the state indicated support.
""This national plan really affirms what we've been working on for the last four years,"" Chaffee County Commission Chairman Greg Felt said. ""There's a lot of potential benefithere. The stuff we are talking about protecting is like capital assets, and you don't want to expend capital assets to cover operating costs. Our landscape is really what we're all about -- economically and in our sense of community."" But what will count as protection, and what won't, has emerged as a challenge.
Biden officials in a 22-page report titled ""Conserving and Restoring America the Beautiful"" set the unprecedented ""30 by 30"" national conservation goal and recommended a 10-year campaign to save and restore forests, wetlands and other natural areas to contain climate warming.
White House officials in meetings around the country emphasized voluntary conservation by private landowners, in addition to state, local and federal protection of public land and water.
Colorado conservation groups are positioning the state to play a key role by developing a strategy to save 14 million acres that remain largely undeveloped within the 67-million-acre area of the state -- by incentivizing voluntary protective easements on private land, creating new parks in cities and rural areas, and dialing back development on public lands.
Roughly 10% of Colorado land and water currently receives some formal protection. The Biden administration plan has won wide support but also faces political obstacles as property rights groups raise concerns.
The goal of saving grew from scientists concerned about climate change who calculated what would be necessary to ensure human survival and slow the extinction of other species. They've said losing natural areas, including habitat for wildlife, is a primary threat.
Scientists internationally are backing a ""global nature deal"" that would establish protection for 50% of the planet by 2050, to be discussed this fall in Kunming, China, as part of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity. Reaching that target has been interpreted by U.S. supporters as requiring protection for 30% of land and water before 2030 in line with efforts in dozens of countries.
About 12% of U.S. land and 23% of oceans around the nation are protected, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A Conservation Science Partners analysis found that, from 2001 to 2017, the United States lost natural terrain the size of a football field every 30 seconds as humans expanded highways, mines, suburbs and other development.
Protecting 30% of land and water by 2030, proponents say, will require cooperative efforts by landowners, tribal nations, cities, rural communities and others for the purpose of taking care of and restoring nature.
Last year, U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Lafayette, launched House legislation to reach the target. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., along with former Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, pushed similar legislation in the Senate.
One week into his presidency, Biden pledged to achieve the 30 by 30 goal, winning some bipartisan support. Biden directed Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to develop a plan by April 27.
Federal officials have paused federal issuance of leases for new fossil fuel development on public land and waters. And the efforts initiated under President Donald Trump to shrink protection for the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears national monuments in Utah are under review. Republican opponents have challenged the Biden efforts as ""a land grab.""
An April 22 letter from the American Farm Bureau Federation to Biden said farmer and rancher concerns ""are escalating regarding the intent of the 3030 goal, the definition of conservation, and the metrics for defining success."" Federation leaders have asked for recognition that farmers and ranchers, through voluntary conservation programs, already have protected more than 140 million acres -- an area bigger than New York and California combined.
""Any discussion about conservation must begin with the recognition that farmers and ranchers are already leaders in this space and have been for decades,"" the letter said. Vilsack subsequently declared ""there's no intent to take land away"" and said 30 by 30 will create new opportunities.
In Colorado, where 10% of the state's 67 million acres already receive some sort of protection, 24% of land already has been modified by human development, a Center for American Progress analysis found. Between 2001 and 2017, it found, development altered nearly 700,000 acres.
Across Colorado and the Rocky Mountain West, polls show, a majority of residents consider themselves ""conservationists"" and support 30 by 30. Mayors from 70 cities along with 450 state and local leaders signed letters declaring support. At least nine western county governments have passed supportive resolutions, including six in Colorado (Boulder, Gilpin, La Plata, San Miguel, Telluride and Broomfield). A ""Colorado Pathways to 3030"" strategy developed last year by Western Resource Advocates and Conservation Colorado calculated that the state already contains about 6 million acres of protected terrain and that Colorado could achieve a 30 by 30 goal within the state by protecting and restoring 14 million more acres of land and waterways. But nature is disappearing rapidly amid a growth and development boom, the strategy report said.
""In Colorado, not only is this loss of nature dramatic and devastating, we are also experiencing the impacts of climate change in the forms of increased catastrophic wildfires, decline of wildlife, increased drought and tree disease,"" the report said. ""If we continue on the same path of nature loss compounded with climate change, we will experience ever-larger consequences that will ultimately collapse entire ecosystems, create dramatic water and food scarcity, and diminish our economy and our quality of life.""

One moment, the forest is calm.
Tree branches sway gently back and forth in the early afternoon wind as heat from the summer sun drenches the crown and understory growing below. It's been hot, and over the past few months, the moisture from the winter snowfall has run its course and the morning dew condensed on the grass has dissipated on the forest floor.
All of a sudden, there's a spark. An ember drifts into a bed of fallen pine needles that have been piling up for decades, maybe centuries, under a clutter of downed trees and brush.
The fire will start small, spitting out wisps of black smoke and slowly singeing the ground around it. But the surrounding area is a seemingly endless supply of fuel and untapped energy that could erupt at any moment into one of the most devastating forces on earth, capable of tearing through millions of acres of forested land -- threatening homes, infrastructure and human lives -- in a brilliant and terrifying display of destruction.
Last year, more than 50,000 wildfires in the United States burned nearly 5 million acres of land, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. But as the length of the fire season continues to grow, along with an unsettling trend of ""megafires"" emerging in places like California and Australia, fire officials and individuals living in the wildland-urban interface could be facing a new normal.https://tpc.g oog lesyndication.com/safeframe/1- 0- 37 /html/container.html
The gold rush and Western expansion
Wildfires are a natural and healthy part of the ecosystem thathelp to break down dead foliage into nutrients for the soil, promote age and species diversity in forests, and reduce fuel loading.
The value of fires was evident to Native Americans long before European-American settlers made their way out West in search of gold. In Colorado, the Ute T ribe used to purposefully burn areas to help promote ecological health and provide horses, bison and other game with better pastures. FlashpointResidents in Summit County and other areas of the wildland-urban interface live under the risk of wildfires much of the year. In this four-part series, we explore how historical policies have contributed to modern fire danger and dive into the science, firefighting tactics and perceptions of what the future of wildfires might look like.
""There is a lot of historical evidence, and also contemporary evidence and observation of Native Americans using fire in a number of different ways,"" said U.S. Forest Service Chief Historian Lincoln Bramwell, Ph.D. ""It was used to clear off and burn forests in the fall to keep them open and allow more game animals to come in that were useful for their survival. ... In different areas, fire was used with planting, basically to fertilize fields and inject more nitrogen into the soil in between planting seasons.
""There are tons of uses that did not resemble gigantic fires that ripped across the landscape. They did a lot of controlled uses. They didn't want to destroy those resources; they just wanted to enhance how well they performed.""
But those uses were largely ignored by European Americans who settled out West and determined that lumber was far too valuable of a resource to let burn -- let alone burn on purpose.
Prospectors arrived in the Summit County area in 1859, a decade after the California gold rush sent streams of settlers out West and just after the Pike's Peak gold rush brought more than 100,000 people to Colorado in search of wealth.
By 1860, the area was littered with sawmills to help support mining efforts. Miners used wood for almost everything, and the deforestation in the area was considerable.
""They needed lumber for buildings, roads, bridges, fuel, support for the mines ... you name it,"" said local author and historian Sandra Mather, Ph.D. ""They stripped it and stripped it because they needed the wood.""
In addition to using lumber to build and heat their homes, cook meals, build infrastructure and other uses, early settlers also clearcut entire mountainsides for hydraulic mining operations, blasting extremely high-pressure jets of water onto the slopes to run sediment and rock material -- and hopefully gold -- into sluice boxes down at the bottom.
The impacts of early logging and mining operations is clearly evident today. As a result of clear cutting and wildfires 100 to 150 years ago, local forests all returned in relative unison. That means there is a lack of age and size diversity in the forests, along with a lack of species diversity as lodgepole pine trees took over.
The current day contiguous landscape made up of older trees is potentially troublesome for foresthealth and fire management efforts.
""There were large-scale logging operations going on in Summit County,"" former Summit Fire & EMS Chief Jeff Berino said. ""But it lead to the wiping out of the forest diversity and allowed for lodgepole to regenerate more plentifully. Now it's come back to bite us.
""We ended up with a forest that was not as diverse. There used to be a mosaic of different species of trees: Douglas fir, blue spruce, aspen, cottonwood. But lodgepole thrives on trauma to the forests, whether it's fire , bugs or logging operations. Within a few years, it came back, all with the same age group of trees, which makes the forest vulnerable.""
In a healthy forest , the diversity of age, size and species help to act as buffers to prevent the wide-ranging and unchecked spread of wildfire and insect infestations.
""If you think about it, they're kind of like speed bumps,"" said Michael Battaglia, Ph.D., a research forester with the U.S. Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Research Station. ""If you have all trees of all the same size with dense forest across an entire mountain, it's pretty easy for a fire to get up and just carry. But if you have trees of differentheights -- or an open-ended forest because
there's a meadow, or an aspen grove or spruce or fir forest intermixed -- you would have a lot of speed bumps that can help break up that powerful movement of wildfires. ...
""That's one of the issues we're dealing with. Now we don't have any of those speed bumps anymore.""
A history of suppression
A lack of diversity isn't the only issue facing modern forests in Summit County and around the country. Another major problem is the county's history of wildfiresuppression.
In the early 20th century, when the federal government took on a more active role in land management, the general consensus scientifically, economically and culturally was that fire was wasteful and dangerous.
""During that time -- the late 19th century and the early 20th century -- Americans still had a really big dependence on wood,"" Bramwell said. ""From that perspective, seeing a wildfire burn down a mature forest seemed like such a waste, particularly for timber companies who saw it as a loss of capital resources. It was literally draining the bank.""
The nation's logging industry started in the Northeast and, once forests in the area we no longer profitable, moved to the Great Lakes and eventually down South. But once a forest was used up, it was abandoned, and the federal government began taking conservation steps to address companies' ""cut and run"" strategies before they made their way to the next big patches of virgin forest in the Pacific Northwest and California.
Forestry science in the early 20th century hadn't caught up to the idea that natural fires were helpful to the environment. And in 1910, one of the most destructive fires in the country's history was more than enough to shape public and official perceptions on the matter.
The Great Fire of 1910 burned more than 3 million acres of timberland in northern Idaho and western Montana over the course of two days. Eighty-six people died in the blaze, primarily firefighters on the front lines, and entire towns were lost.
""It really shocked the nation into action,"" Bramwell said. ""At that time, the Forest Service was really small, a couple thousand employees across the country. They didn't have the resources to handle fires. Congress literally doubled the agency's budget the next year and said, 'You need to fight fires.'""
The fire served as the foundational experience to influence fire management practices for the next 50 years and in 1935 became an official national strategy as part of the 10 a.m. policy, which required fire agencies to try to suppress any forest fires by 10 a.m. the day after ignition.
Officials have been rethinking total suppression strategies for years. The National Park Service began allowing backcountry fires to burn in 1968, and the Forest Service adopted a similar stance in 1978, according to Bramwell.
But decades of suppression have left many forests in danger of more extreme fire conditions.
""We've become very adverse to fire,"" said Dan Schroder, Summit County's Colorado State University Extension director. ""Fuel loading is a matter of branches and dry, flammable material in the forested ecosystems. Fire would have naturally burned off a lot of that flammable vegetation. But because of (suppression policies), we now have an overstocked fuel load in our forests across the nation.
""Today, when a wildfire occurs, it's typically more intense and could be more severe and long lasting. And then we may be dealing with deeper environmental consequences.""
Changing climate
Climate also has played a major role in how we view fire danger today.
Between 1895 and 1900, the average temperature in Colorado was just over 44 degrees Fahrenheit, according to data from the National Centers for Environmental Information, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. From 2015-2019, the state averaged 47 deg rees.
While that might not seem significant, experts say the rise in temperature has had dramatic effects on foresthealth.
""There's a couple things we're seeing, and that we expect to get worse,"" Battaglia said. ""We know Colorado has warmed quite a bit over the last century, and that has had effects west-wide.""
Battaglia said that historically colder winters helped to regulate insect populations like beetles that impact tree and wider foresthealth. But insects are able to survive warmer winters, and with nothing else to cull the population, more trees are being affected.
Warmer weather also means earlier snowmelt along with more widespread cycles of longer and hotter droughts.
""If you have snow, and it melts slowly, it can last into the summer,"" Battaglia said. ""But if it's rain, it just runs off, oftentimes, and you don't have that reserve. It stresses your plants, and fuels dry out much quicker. ... There's a lot more hot days, and when you combine that with a drought, it's not a happy thing for a tree.""
It also means a constantly growing wildfireseason.
In Summit County, wildfires historically occurred deep into the summer months, but blazes have become more commonplace as early as March and as late as October, according to Berino.
""Climate change has affected the wildfireseason, period,"" Berino said. ""In Summit County, we used to be a joke with firefighters and the Forest Service because we'd get fires that wouldn't do anything. But in my career, just over the last 40 years, we're starting to see more aggressive fires up here.""
Summit County officials and fire districts, along with the Forest Service and others, have been working over recent years to address all of these issues. But between longer fire seasons, dryer and more dense fuel loads, and a lack of diversity in surrounding forests, wildfires are becoming more dangerous.
""Climate change and years of suppression -- right or wrong -- has lead to a huge fuel load in the forest , and an environment that's hotter and dryer,"" Berino said. ""We never heard the term megafire until this last decade. Now it's common language.
""We don't have the conditions that California has with the Santa Ana winds. But could we have a megafire? Yes. I hope not. We have well-trained people and some good defensive space. But in the right place in the right time, and if the conditions are right, we could certainly have one.

Great Outdoors Colorado is sinking nearly $1.56 million into three projects around Loveland -- a new campground at Carter Lake, trailhead facilities to enhance Oxbow Natural Area and fire mitigation work to improve the Big Thompson and Poudre river watersheds in the wake of the largest fire in state history.
The three grants, announced last week, are part of a program called Resilient Communities, aimed to help fund projects to respond to ""one-time, immediate needs or opportunities that have emerged in direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic"" as they tie to stewardship, conservation, access and connections to the outdoors, according to information in a press release.
Sky View Campground boasts a first-of-its-kind concept for Larimer County -- pods of campsites grouped together to foster large group gatherings, all with amenities woven in for those who have mobility challenges. The campground could open at Carter Lake as early as fall of 2021, increasing camping opportunities at an already crowded Larimer County area and broadening outdoor opportunities for more people.
""The pod design and infrastructure durability at Sky View Campground will allow us to accommodate groups and offer a new camping option for individuals with limited mobility, broadening our reach to additional citizens,"" Daylan Figgs, director of Larimer County's Department of Natural Resources, said in a press release.
Sky View at Carter Lake
A $475,334 grant from Great Outdoors Colorado will be used toward construction of the Sky View Campground on the east side of Carter Lake, located west of Loveland. The 15-site area, when full, will be able to accommodate a total of 120 campers, offering unique facilities for groups.
The campground, located across from Carter Knolls off County Road 31, will be built with three pods each with five campsites; each site can accommodate a tent or a recreational vehicle and up to eight people. These are designed to lend themselves to large groups, such as reunions and youth clubs, that want facilities to camp near each other, according to information from the county.
A pavilion that will seat up to 50 people will be located near a group fire pit, and the campground also will have paved parking and two vault toilets.
The new campground also will feature amenities for people with mobility challenges, including paved roads and parking, one ADA accessible campsite per pod and accessible picnic tables in the pavilion.
Construction will occur next year with a grand opening either in the fall or in the spring of 2022.
Sky View will offer more spaces in an area with a growing demand for camping, especially as the coronavirus pandemic pushed more people outdoors. This year, occupancy rates hit 95% on weekdays and 100% on weekends at Carter Lake from June through September, not counting times areas were closed due to the pandemic or the Cameron Peak Fire , according to information from the county.
The new campground will help alleviate overcrowding at the lake instead of exacerbating the issues, according to information on the county website, which states, ""we believe the campground will help absorb the current demand. We are adding Sky View Campground to meet the demands of the present community already utilizing Carter Lake for recreation. Additional campsites will help provide needed durable infrastructure that assists management and enforcement of the area.""
Oxbow Natural Area
The trailhead at Loveland's Oxbow Natural Area, located on both sides of the 1100 block of Rossum Drive, received a $330,332 grant to add play features, pedestrian access and other features to the west Loveland natural area.
Improvements that are planned for the natural area include five different nature-play features for children, a bicycle repair station and rack and a permanent restroom facility, according to a news release. The city also will expand the parking lot, add a new sidewalk, interpretive signs and a pedestrian crossing, and plans to restore native grasses and improve drainage to the Big T hompson River.
""These enhancements will provide a more enriching recreational experience and help mitigate impacts from increased visitation,"" according to a release from Great Outdoors Colorado.
Fire mitigation
The largest grant, $751,681 goes to Larimer County and the Forest Stewards Guild to complete what was described as ""critical fire fuel mitigation work"" in the watersheds around the Big T hompson River around Loveland and the Poudre River around Fort Collins.
Both watersheds were impacted by the Cameron Peak Fire , which sparked Aug. 13, has burned 208,913 acres and is 94% contained. The fire, the largest in Colorado history, led to many days of poor air quality throughout the region and damage across both watersheds, which together provide drinking water to more than 1.3 million people, according to information from Great Outdoors Colorado.
The project includes burning piles of branches and debris that has been thinned from forests as wildfire protection but that the state was not allowing to be burned earlier this year because of the potential respiratory impact for those vulnerable to the coronavirus, according to a release. Crews from Larimer County and the Forest Stewards Guild also will thin more trees while they burn, from January through May.
While improving fire safety, the burns also will be used to train new firefighters.

Governor Jared Polis announced on Wednesday a statewide wildfire relief fund.
According to Polis, more than 400,000 Coloradans are estimated to receive a one-time direct payment of $375 stemming from untapped funds.
The signed executive order mandates that eligibility for these payments will be limited to Colorado residents earning under $52,000 and have filed for unemployment at least once between March 15 and Oct. 24 of this year.
Eligibility also requires that Coloradans met state eligibility requirements for a weekly benefit amount between $25 and $500 during that time period.
Polis has stated that money will reach bank accounts by Dec. 1.
Applications will not be necessary.
In Colorado, over 700,000 acres have burned this year, which totals almost 1,100 square miles.
Colorado still burns.
The Western slope has seen over 100,000 acres of fire damage, including the Pine Gulch fire at 139,007 acres worth of damage.
The Pine Gulch fire became the largest fire in Colorado history, reaching 100 percent containment in September in Mesa County.
The Cameron Peak fire is now at 92 percent containment as of Nov. 5, when 208,913 acres had been reported burned.
The fire started in August.
The Grimes Peak area in Grand County is currently fighting the East Troublesome Fire, now at 42 percent containment.
According to the West Slope Fire Info website, counties currently in Stage 1 fire restrictions are Gunnison, Hinsdale, Mesa, and Ouray.
In efforts to relieve the devastation wrought by the wildfires, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy (CDP) Colorado Wildfires Relief fund will help communities recover through targeted grant-making that prioritizes medium to long-term recovery.
The fund will target and support vulnerable populations and communities disproportionately
affected. It will also work to identify and fill in gaps where public resources are unavailable or scarce.
""Colorado communities have been devastated by historic, climate-induced wildfires, and this fund will help us swiftly respond, build up reserves throughout the year and more, while strategically allocating funding to communities who need it the most,"" Polis said.
""I encourage Coloradans and any individual or organization willing to help our communities impacted by wildfires.""
The CDP makes ""targeted, holistic investments with grants that will address the greatest emergent needs and gaps in the funding of mitigation and recovery efforts.""
In the meantime, the West Region Wildfire Council (WRWC) encourages preparedness and mitigation for homeowners and communities.
""We advise having an evacuation route. Some communities only have one way in and out, so there's the definite potential for loss of life, as we've seen this year unfortunately."" Jamie Gomez, executive director for the West Region Wildfire Council, explained.
The WRWC works with homeowners and communities throughout the west region, covering six county areas: Delta, Gunnison, Hinsdale, Montrose, Ouray and San Miguel counties.
They work in coordination with a variety of organizations, from about 24 fire districts, US forest districts, to emergency management departments.
Their mission is to help homeowners and communities understand the wildfire risk and what they can do for prevention.
The organization works on multiple scales, from homeowners to community and landscape scales.
Gomez explained that achieving their goals require active participation from the community.
The WRWC is available to meet with homeowners individually and advise on how to reduce ignition to homes during a wildfire.
""Homeowners can get educated on what they specifically can do with their home and property."" Gomez said.
""Requesting a site visit can accomplish this. During a site visit, we'll really focus in on their home. There are things they can do to reduce the possibility of an ember landing on their home or deck.""
Gomez explained that many homeowners don't realize that embers are a leading cause of ignition to homes during a wildfire.
Gomez said the WRWC can discuss how homeowners can retrofit a home and deck for prevention.
Other options include installing a hardened deck area, cutting back grasses and weeds within 30 feet of the home, as well as removing metal flashes at the base of any wood sidings.
""They can install a gutter cap on gutters to limit or eliminate potential for leaves to collect and ignite from an ember,"" Gomez said.
""As you can see, you can get detailed, lengthy to-do lists if you look for them. From cutting trees to removing brush, the list could go on.""
Gomez explained there was a financial incentive program in place to incentivize and help homeowners actively participate in prevention directives.
He encourages people to reach out to their department for more information and a site visit.
""Making sure your cell phone and email is registered with the county emergency system ""Code Red"" is important,"" Gomez said.
""Landlines are automatically registered, but cell phones and email are not. Homeowners should register to stay on top of emergency notifications.""

As of 6:30 a.m. Monday the upper Frying Pan Valley from Ruedi Dam to Hagerman Pass is under a preevacuation notice due to the Sylvan Fire near Eagle, according to local public safety alerts.
An evacuation center is set up at Basalt High School but closed at 4 p.m. Monday, according to a
community alert issued around 1:30 p.m. More information is available at www.ecemo.org.
According to a tweet from the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office, those in the Ruedi, Meredith and
Thomasville areas (including all residences and businesses above Ruedi Dam) may be asked to
evacuate if the fire worsens.
The Sylvan Fire broke out around 3:15 p.m. Sunday near the Sylvan Lake Campground about 12 miles
south of Eagle. The fire had burned more than 1,400 acres by 4 p.m. Monday, according to an update
from the United States Forest Service.
Fire crews reported extreme fire behavior on Sunday; campers and recreationalists in Sylvan Lake State
Park have been evacuated. Additional information about the incident is available at bit.ly/sylvanfire.
The pre-evacuation is for the Sylvan Fire, not another wildland fire that crews responded to Sunday
evening near mile marker 11 on Frying Pan Road near Ruedi Reservoir. A helicopter was dropping water
on the fire and a federal wildland crew was enroute to that blaze as of about 4:45 p.m. Sunday, according
to a post from the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office.
Editor's note: This story has been updated to note that the evacuation center at Basalt High School
closed at 4 p.m. Monday and to update the acres burned due to the Sylvan Fire. The pre-evacuation
notice remains in effect in the Thomasville and Meredith areas.

April 9, 2021  Steamboat Pilot & Today (CO)  Suzie Romig For Steamboat Pilot * Today
ST EAMBOAT SPRINGS -- If the more than 20,500-acre Middle Fork Fire in northern Routt County late last year was not a wake-up call for residents to understand the seriousness of local wildlife risk, this year's combination of high threats from drought and abundant beetle-killed trees should confirm the dangers.
""Our forests are facing many challenges now because of longer fire seasons, high fuel loads, severe drought and beetles,"" said Carolina Manriquez, local forester with the Colorado State Forest Service. ""It's not a matter of if, but when (for the next fire). We've been lucky in Routt County; the Middle Fork Fire stayed mostly in wilderness areas because of our prevalent winds.""
Members of the Routt County Wildfire Mitigation Council -- which includes 38 fire professionals, agency representatives and local residents -- are pushing for strong attendance during four weekly, virtual evenings of educational presentations to help everyone learn how to do their part to prevent wildfires. The 2021 Routt County Wildfire Conference titled ""Learning from 2020 to Prepare for Wildfire Season"" is an effort to promote public awareness and understanding of wildfire risk to foster community-driven action to reduce risk and the impacts of wildfire in Routt County.
""The more people who get educated about the fire environment, that will be a huge help to our community and our forest ,"" said Kevin T hompson, a fire management officer based in Yampa for Routt National Forest . ""The key is educating people to understand the role they play, the role that fire plays and how we live with it.""
Manriquez said with the patchwork of private, state and federal lands along with no single entity overseeing all wildfire concerns in Routt County, broad community and partner participation for wildfire education and efforts are critical. She said the increase in forest visitors boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic also adds to wildfire risks.
The free conference also will focus on home ignition zones and being prepared as an individual home or land owner, case studies and best practices for HOAs and small communities, and community level preparedness and recovery. The sessions will be 5 to 6:15 p.m. April 29 and May, 6, 13 and 20. Registration is available at RouttWildfire.org.
One of the educators slated for May 20 is Schelly Olson, assistant chief at Grand Fire Protection District No. 1 in Granby, whose own family's home north of Grand Lake burned down to the concrete for a complete loss during the East Troublesome Fire.
If you go
What: 2021 Routt County Wildfire Conference
When: Four free virtual presentations, 5 p.m. April 29, May 6, 13 and 20
Info: routtwildfire.org
""It's crazy. You spend your career working on wildfire preparedness, then it happens to you,"" said Olson, chair of the nonprofit Grand County Wildfire Council started in 2013. ""It's the most devasting thing I've ever gone through professionally and personally.""
The late season East Troublesome Fire originated Oct.14, 2020, 15 miles northeast of Kremmling and became Colorado's second largest wildfire at 193,812 acres, burning 366 homes and more than 200 additional structures. The cause is still under investigation.
The Middle Fork Fire started from a lightning strike Sept. 6, 2020, in dry mixed conifer trees about 10 miles north of Steamboat Springs in the Mount Zirkel Wilderness Area. The fire was not declared contained until Nov. 17, 2020, and controlled until Dec. 15, 2020, T hompson said.
T hompson said the current wildfireseason in Routt County starts approximately one month earlier and ends one month later than before circa 2000. Rather than July through September for the greatest fire danger worries, the heightened season is now June through October.
The longer fire season stems from a number of factors, T hompson said, ranging from beetlekilled trees allowing in more sunlight to melt snow on the ground to a later monsoon season to climate change, which studies show has warmed Colorado on average 2.5 degrees in the past 50 years. Considering the fire events from 2020, which had an average snowpack and dry summer, 2021 with even less snowpack and another predicted dry summer adds up to continued fire dang er.
""When you put all of that together, there is a very high likelihood that we have the potential for another big fire year,"" T hompson said.
Forester Manriquez stressed that the council's tagline ""Mitigation starts with you"" is the key takehome message. Everyone living in, recreating in or visiting Routt County has a role to play in reducing wildfire risk. She said the highest areas of wildfire risks are in the Fish Creek watershed, northern and southern portions of Routt County and throughout the county's extensive WUI, or wildlandurban interface, the zone of transition where development meets undeveloped wildland veg etation.

Public feedback sought on Routt County climate action plan.txt,"Public feedback sought on Routt County climate action plan
August 5, 2020  Steamboat Pilot & Today (CO)
Author: Derek Maiolo dmaiolo@SteamboatPilot.com Section: Environment 827 Words
OpenURL Link
STEAMBOAT SPRINGS  Routt County is seeking public feedback on drafting a climate action plan to
address the impacts of climate change.
The plan comes as communities across the world look for ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and respond to environmental phenomena, such as extended drought and warmer winters, that
scientists already are attributing to climate change.
Last year, the county and city of Steamboat Springs agreed to collaborate on the climate action plan,
both with implementation and funding. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed portions of the plan, but local
leaders made a recent commitment to following through on their goals, according to Routt County
Commissioner Beth Melton.
""We were generally in agreement climate change isn't going anywhere just because of COVID, and it
continues to be an important focus for us,"" Melton said of the plan.
A project management team now comprises representatives from the county, the city, Steamboat Ski &
Resort Corp. and the Steamboat Springs Chamber.
Members of the team helped create a new website that explains the need for climate action and
describes the ways people can get involved. One thing residents can do immediately is to take the online
survey at routtclimateaction.com.
The survey gauges people's knowledge of climate change and asks what potential impacts are at the top
of people's minds. It lists some specific ideas proposed for reducing emissions, such as installing more
electric vehicle charging stations, restricting the development of new fossil fuel infrastructure and
enhancing recycling programs to reduce waste.
A 2018 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory showed emissions from Routt County, including
Steamboat, were about the same as the emissions from 150,000 passenger cars in a year. Among the
most pressing threats climate change poses to the county include higher temperatures, reduced
snowpack, increased risk of wildfires, more severe droughts, more extreme weather and increased
flooding.
To combat these consequences, local leaders are exploring solutions around five distinct areas: energy,
transportation, land use, waste, education and advocacy.
Climate action has been a prickly issue, and proposed solutions often are met with varying degrees of
controversy or frustration over a perceived lack of adequate action.
Commissioner Doug Monger, for example, finds it difficult to support a climate action plan he said could
prove ""catastrophic for West Routt."" His district, which encompasses Hayden Station, relies heavily on
the coal industry for public funding and jobs. When it comes to climate change, he wonders if ""the cure is
worse than the pain.""
At the same time, Monger is running for reelection, and one of his campaign promises is a commitment
to implementing the climate action plan. Whathe wants to see is a well-thought strategy that takes into
account the various industries in the county and reduces the harm of any major changes.
To combat the effects of climate change on a statewide level, Gov. Jared Polis signed a climate action
plan last year. It established a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% in 2050 from pollution
levels in 2005.
But in July, the environmental advocacy group WildEarth Guardians filed a lawsuit against Polis'
administration, alleging it hasn't done enough to meet its climate action goals and demanding a more
concrete plan to accomplish its ambitious greenhouse emission reductions.
Commissioner Melton serves on the oversight committee for the local climate action plan. The
committee is comprised of local leaders from the county and its municipalities, including Hayden, Oak
Creek and Yampa, and it is tasked with offering guidance and setting priorities.
Melton also disagrees with the idea that climate action and economic prosperity are mutually exclusive.
On the contrary, she believes the health of the local economy is contingent on how well the world
addresses and responds to a changing climate.
""There is widespread agreement among scientists about the devastating impacts on our economy and
our way of life that will occur if we don't do something to change course,"" Melton said. ""I think it is
important for all of us to identify the role we have to play in tackling this.""
From Steamboat Resort's reliance on winter snowpack to local ranchers' dependence on summer
moisture, it is hard to find an industry not linked in some way to the natural environment. Monger's ranch
outside of Hayden is one of many facing the negative impacts of a 20-year drought that threatens water
supplies and crops.
As Melton added, a necessary component to comprehensive climate action is resiliency planning, so the
community can be proactive about the ways the environment already is responding to global trends,
from hotter summers to more extreme weather patterns.
Following the community survey, the next steps of the collaborative climate action plan include approving
and beginning to implement a list of local solutions by October. In the winter, members of the committee
behind the planning process will host an open house for more public feedback. By the end of the year,
the final action plan should be adopted.

March 4, 2021  Aspen Times, The (CO)  Staff report
Colorado experienced a record-setting fire season in 2020 with the three largest recorded wildfires sweeping through the state.
The situation might be the new normal for Colorado because of drought, climate change and increasing development on the edge of forests, according to experts.
T hree local conservation groups are bringing in a top wildfire researcher Thursday night for a presentation on wildfires via Zoom and Facebook. Philip Higuera, an associate professor at the University of Montana, will put the 2020 fire season into long-term perspective gained from paleoecological records of climate , fire and forest history in Colorado subalpine forests over the past 6,000 years.
Higuera said he would sort out what is business as usual and what aspects are unprecedented.
""Colorado's 2020 fire season kind of provides the opportunity to have this conversation about changing wildfire activity, climate change, what it means for humans and ecosystems,"" Higuera told The Aspen T imes in an interview this week.
For Higuera, the presentation will be a homecoming of sorts. He was a naturalist at Aspen Center for Environmental Studies in summer 1999.
""I wish I was physically coming back, but hopefully we'll figure that out in the after times at some point,"" he said in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Naturalist Nights has been a popular speaker series hosted for years by Aspen Center for Environmental Studies, Wilderness Workshop and Roaring Fork Audubon. It went virtual this winter due to social distancing requirements.
The Thursday presentation is free and open to the public. Pre-registration is required at www.aspennature.org .
Higuera currently directs the PaleoEcology Lab and Fire Ecology Lab at the University of Montana. He is eager to share his knowledge with the Aspen audience.
""It's exciting for me to be able to connect research that I've been involved in for over a decade and a longstanding interest and curiosity in subalpine forests in general,"" he said.

RBC I The county commissioners hosted an interagency meeting Tuesday afternoon following the regular board meeting. Leaders and representatives from multiple county departments and area entities presented updates on activities and projects.
BLM--KENT WALTER, WHITE RIVER FIELD MANAGER
Walter said the BLM's comment period on changes to grazing regulations closes March 6. Documentation for the revisions is available at https://tinyurl.com/rtu8eq8.
Walter also said approval of the travel resources management plan, the Buffalo Horn land exchange, a wild horse gather plan for outside the herd management area and an environmental assessment for wild horses inside the management area are underway.
Comments are also open on the proposed sale of six BLM parcels--four in the Strawberry Creek area and two along the Grand Hogback in Garfield County. The BLM considers the parcels ""difficult and uneconomic to manage as part of the public lands."" If approved, the parcels would be sold to White River Lodge, LLC.
Walter also said the White River Field Office has several employment opportunities available.
WILDLIFE SERVICES DAVID MORENO AND JUSTIN EWING
Moreno reported on a meeting in Craig Feb. 10 aimed at educating the public about wolves. Conservation methods, including trapping, were discussed, but Moreno said it's important to know that those methods only apply to Wildlife Services, not to the general public or to livestock producers.
Ewing said he has been working on the corvid problem--crows and ravens--at the landfill, and this year appears to be getting some help from a pair of golden eagles. In previous years the ravens were numerous enough they chased off the eagles, but the eagles have since ""set up a kind of territory"" and are taking out crows and ravens on their own.
COLORADO PARKS AND WILDLIFE AREA MANAGER BILL DEVERGIE
deVergie extrapolated on the discussion about wolves, responding to a question from Commissioner Gary Moyer about what defines wolves as ""established"" in an area. If a species is considered established, federal law would negate introducing additional animals. deVergie said there would need to be two reproducing wolf packs existing within the state for 16-18 months for them to be considered established. At this time, there's one confirmed pack in the extreme northwest corner and a lone male wolf with a radio collar in North Park (Jackson County).
""As long as wolves are federally protected, we [CPW] have hardly any authority to do anything,"" deVergie said. ""We're going to have to start working hard to determine where we're going as a state agency now that we know we have a pack existing. It's all new territory; we're going to have to adapt and learn as we go along.""
CPW is also revisiting its plan for management of mountain lions, as problems have increased in rural communities across the Western Slope. CPW is hosting several meetings to discuss the West Region Mountain Lion plan. There will be a meeting in Meeker Wednesday, Feb. 19 at 6 p.m. at Mountain Valley Bank open to the public.
At this point, deer and elk winter survival looks pretty good for Rio Blanco County, deVergie said.
RBC NATURAL RESOURCES LANNIE MASSEY
Massey said there have been 21 drilling applications, two spills ... ""none of them real major,"" and three or four pipeline abandonments.
RBC ASSESSOR RENAE NIELSON
Rangely's property taxes went up, Nielson said, due to the hospital mill levy. The county's tax valuation is up about 5.5% due to oil and gas.
RBC ROAD & BRIDGE DAVE MORLAN
Morlan said this summer Road and Bridge plans to widen corners on the Burro Mountain road for public safety and are working on a couple of bridge replacements. The county has received a grant to replace the bridge across the White River at County Road 73, ""one of the worst bridges in the state,"" Morlan said.
This year's spring thaw load restrictions in the Piceance Basin are on track to start the first week of March. The restrictions generally last 20-28 days and have an impact on Natural Soda and other industries that haul heavy loads.
RBC EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TY GATES
Gates said the multijurisdictional hazard mitigation plan is being adopted, along with a county-wide emergency operations plan.
RBC SHERIFF ANTHONY MAZZOLA
""Last year we got beat up hard with the criminal justice reforms,"" Mazzola said. Legislation that is ""easier"" on criminals is hard on law enforcement, such as a bill introduced this year that would allow a 72-hour grace period for people who fail to appear in court. He has committed to spending more time working with other agencies and organizations to ""at least make our voices heard as a county sheriff's office,"" at the state legislature.
The Sheriff's Office has a part-time opening for a nurse at the jail.
U.S. FOREST SERVICE BLANCO RANGER DISTRICT CURTIS KEETCH
Keetch said the Blanco District is moving forward with the Yellow Jacket timber management project. The scoping period starts Feb. 20. Of a 39,000 acre area, the project proposes treating 2,300 acres of forested land. T imber removed would be hauled to a mill in Montrose and a mill in Gypsum. The project would require realignment of two roads in the area to improve the travel corridor.
Keetch said the Buford-New Castle road widening will happen this year and said they have received letters to support a review of the travel plan to allow OHV use.
The Blanco District is also planning a small parking area at Miller Creek at the forest boundary.
Keetch praised the district's internship program with Colorado Mesa University, established by Mary Cunningham in memory of her son Jake. The program, in its fourth year this year, should place 40 interns. This year will also be the 18th year Cunningham has led the local observance of the World Migratory Bird Day in May, giving students an opportunity to identify local migratory birds.
The Rocky Mountain Youth Corps will return this summer to help replace the roof on the Lost Creek shop, which was damaged in a fire last year. The building itself was spared thanks to the volunteer fire department, Keetch said.
GeoCorps students will be posted at Spring Cave again this year to talk to visitors about the bat population, the cave and white-nose syndrome.
With only four permanent employees on the district, Keetch echoed the sentiments of others-- jobs are available.
ERBM RECREATION & PARK DISTRICT SEAN VONROENN
VonRoenn said the rec district plans to install LED lights at Paintbrush Park to finish the baseball field, is moving forward on pond construction at Circle Park and working with the Town of Meeker to plan additional improvements at Circle Park and conceptual ideas for the in-town river corridor.
WHITE RIVER AND DOUGLAS CREEK CONSERVATION DISTRICT SCALLIE HENDRICKSON
Hendrickson said this will be the third year of reviewing the algae bloom on the White River and that they expect a report in 2021.
Water is a focus for the districts, with discussion about water management. She urged people to review a report to be released in the next few weeks and comment. The report will be available online at whiterivercd.com.
PIONEERS MEDICAL CENTER MARGIE JOY
PMC will celebrate its 70th year this year, and the Walbridge Wing turns 60, Joy said. Meeker Family Health saw more patient visits in 2019 than 2018. They're coming from surrounding areas, Joy said, and not just for ortho visits, although tracking ZIP codes of ortho patients reflects people coming in from as far as Alaska, Vermont and North Carolina.
The expansion will add jobs, Joy said. ""...About $2 million in annual payroll once the build-out is done.""
In the second half of 2020, PMC will begin a feasibility study about needed senior services.
PMC's search for a CEO is still ongoing. ""It is a very specialized position,"" she said.
RBC EXTENSION OFFICE LINDA MASTERS
Masters, just over a year into her role as RBC Extension Agent, said, ""There have been a lot of changes at Extension in the last year or two.""
She said the 4-H program is ""going strong"" and they are always looking for 4-H leaders. She's also working closely with the Fair Board and expects this year's county fair to be better than ever. ""We're so far ahead of the game from where we were last year,"" she said.
Masters also said Colorado State University is doing live webinars that are available to the public. The current webinars are on ag marketing.
RBC BUILDING DEPARTMENT LADONNA CARLSON
Carlson said building has been good in the last year, and hopes that trend will continue.
RBC WEED AND PEST  JANE TURNBURKE
There is a pesticide workshop Feb. 20 in Meeker that will meet continuing education credit requirements for pesticide applicators. (See News Briefs on Page 3A for details.)
RBC IT DYLON MERRELL
Cybersecurity training for county employees has been completed, Merrell said.
RBC SALES T AXDEB MORLAN
The new sales tax rules that went into effect last year has increased the sales tax revenue coming back to the towns and county from online purchases. Morlan said the December distribution report came out to 261 legal-size pages of accounts that paid sales tax back to the towns and county for online purchases.
TOWN OF MEEKER TOWN MANAGER LISA COOK
Cook said the town's well improvements project should be finished by early summer. The town
plans to install a new 8-inch water line down the full-length of Water Street; sidewalks from Market Street to the high school and a crosswalk signal at Fifth and Market streets. The town's recycling program is now being operated by Eagle River Waste Services and the town is cleaning up and renovating its property at the end of T hird Street.
Cook also said there will be additional meetings at the end of April about the updates to the comprehensive plan and the land use plan.
RBC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MAKALA BARTON
Barton said economic development is working to maintain and be part of the conversations around T ri-State's decision to close the Craig power plant and the Colowyo coal mine. ""Moffat County is obviously the focus, but we don't want to be forgotten,"" she said. ""We're collaborating with the Department of Labor to do some outreach and regional studies.""
Barton, with Commissioner Jeff Rector and Moffat County Commissioner Don Cook are working on a draft proposal to help communities impacted by the loss of fossil fuel extraction to renewables.
Economic Development is also working on marketing, providing county news and department spotlights to the public, and is continuing work with the Small Business Development Center.
RBC DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES BARBARA BOFINGER
While DHS is traditionally reactive, not preventive, Bofinger said they want to ""focus on those kids and families who haven't walked through our doors"" to do some prevention and intervene before they have a need.
RBC PUBLIC HEALTH ALICE HARVEY
Harvey shared her progress in creating a community health database to track communicable disease like influenza in the county. With coronavirus in the news, she said the threat in RBC is very small and will probably remain so. Still, they are focused on surveillance, prevention and awareness. ""Public health touches everything,"" she said.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife will fund $319,000 toward improving motorized trails in cooperation with the Colorado Youth Corps Association.
According to a CPW news release March 31, the Youth Corp will be hired for 33 weeks to repair trails impacted by wildfire damage and increased visitation in areas open to motorized recreation.
Projects include the Alpine Loop Backcountry Byway, Rainbow Trail near Salida and Grand Lake OHV area. Work is expected to begin in June.
The Alpine Loop Backcountry Byway that connects Silverton with Lake City sees 385,000 visitors annually.
CPW said the proliferation of vehicle-accessible dispersed campsites along the Alpine Loop are becoming a capacity and density issue, affecting visitor experience and impacting natural resources.
The Bureau of Land Management is working toward addressing these issues through campsite designation. The work would also include removing 125 rock fire rings, bagging ash piles containing nails and glass, cleaning up trash, installing 125 metal fire rings and campsite posts and bucking and felling hazard trees.
Designating campsites will address issues the proliferation of campsites, trash, soil compaction in fragile locations and vehicle encroachment off the roadways.
Rainbow Trail near SalidaThe Rainbow Trail near Salida features 100 miles of single track popular with motorcyclists. With the use of saw crews, hazard tree mitigation will help with user safety as well as trail sustainability.
Grand LakeThe off-road vehicle Grand Lake Trail system in the Arapaho National Forest was impacted by wildfires in 2020.
More than 200 miles of the off-road system damaged by wildfire will be worked on by the Youth Corp. Projects will improve runoff systems and benched-trail tread through burn scars.
Colorado's trails saw explosive growth in visitation in 2020 as people looked for outdoor and socially distanced activities during the pandemic.
Local, state and federal outdoor agencies across the state reported on average a 30% increase in visitation on public lands, according to CPW.
In addition to higher visitation, last summer's catastrophic wildfires posed new challenges for
Colorado's trail network, as heavily burned wildfire areas shifted wildlife movements and the connectivity of some trails because of post-burn hot spots in forest areas.
""As we monitor how human use and natural disasters impact our outdoor spaces, we have an obligation to work together to protect our trails so that they can be enjoyed for generations to come,"" said Fletcher Jacobs, CPW's State Trails Program Manager. ""We look forward to collaborating with Colorado Youth Corps because it allows us to bond with our outdoor community at a grassroots level, and get our hands dirty together as we work toward rebuilding areas that will enhance recreation opportunities.""
